'''Abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. Abstract objects have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].&lt;ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=0495898023|author1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D. M.|title=Sketch for a systematic metaphysics|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199655915|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]].

==In philosophy&lt;!--'Third Realm (Frege)' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract-concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Edward Zalta]] and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]], have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In modern philosophy, the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Popper's three worlds]].&lt;/ref&gt; different from the external world or from internal [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Gideon|title=Abstract Objects|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract-concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract-concrete distinction, follow the link below to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete and abstract thinking==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe the different types of learning.  Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.

==Quasi-abstract entities==
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as nonexisting because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson, [http://www.edwardheath.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Social_Agentivity.pdf "A Theory of Social Agentivity and Its Integration into the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering"], ''[[International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems]]'' '''7'''(4) (2011) pp. 62–86.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AeroVironment Global Observer''' is a concept for a high-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], designed by [[AeroVironment]] (AV) to operate as a stratospheric [[geosynchronous]] satellite system with regional coverage.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/aerovironments-global-observer-flying-high-again-03902/ Defense Industry Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Global Observer aircraft, each flying for up to a week at an altitude of {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}}, could alternate coverage over any area on the earth, providing a platform for communications relays, remote sensing, or long-term surveillance. In addition to flying above weather and above other conventional aircraft, operation at this altitude permits communications and sensor payloads on the aircraft to service an area on the surface of the earth up to {{convert|600|mi|km}} in diameter, equivalent to more than {{convert|280000|sqmi|km2}} of coverage. Global Observer may offer greater flexibility than a satellite and longer duration than conventional manned and unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

==Development==

===JCTD program===
The Global Observer Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program had the goal of helping solve the capability gap in persistent ISR and communications relay for the [[US military]] and homeland security.  The Global Observer JCTD demonstrated a new stratospheric, extreme endurance UAS that could be transitioned for post-JCTD development, extended user evaluation, and fielding.  The program was a joint effort with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Department of Homeland Security]], and AeroVironment that started in September 2007, to culminate in a Joint Operational Utility Assessment (JOUA) in 2011.

The program provided for the system development, production of two aircraft, development flight testing, and JOUA with ISR and communications relay payload.  The flight testing and JOUA was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. The primary objectives of the Global Observer JCTD Program were:

*Develop enabling technologies for a liquid hydrogen powered Global Observer UAS.
*Design, build, and demonstrate the Global Observer UAS for a 5 - 7 day endurance for {{convert|55000|to|65000|ft|m}} altitude missions with 380-pound, 2.8&amp;nbsp;kW payload capacity. The system had to be capable of being transported by a C-130 aircraft.
*Integrate and assess military utility of modular Global Observer payloads to address user identified gaps in ISR and communications relay.
*Evaluate system life cycle costs.

===JCTD sponsors===
*U.S. Department of Defense
*United States Special Operations Command
*United States Strategic Command
*U.S. Department of Homeland Security
*U.S. Air Force
*U.S. Army
*U.S. Coast Guard
*U.S. Defense Threat Reductions Agency

===Flight test partners===
*Air Force Flight Test Center
*NASA Dryden Flight Research Center

===Mission possibilities===
High-altitude, long endurance [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, such as Global Observer, may enable several capabilities that enable rapid and effective actions or [[countermeasure]]s:
* '''Communications relay.'''  Durable, satellite-like, affordable communications relay with substantial bandwidth capacity can interconnect and route data in real time, enabling teams and command centers separated by topographical barriers to communicate with each other.
* '''Disaster response.''' Hurricane, storm tracking and general weather monitoring may be useful in evacuation planning, relief operations and first response coordination. Global Observer provides communication alternatives in the event of cell tower, microwave relay and satellite downlink failure.
* '''Maritime surveillance.''' Coastlines plagued by transport of illegal goods can be subject to long-term surveillance. Analysts can observe suspicious activity, determine patterns of behavior and identify threats.

==History==

A Global Observer prototype, called "Odyssey," flew in May 2005.  It had a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, one-third the size of the planned full-sized version, and ran solely on hydrogen fuel-cells powering electric motors that drove eight propellers, flying the aircraft for several hours.  The JCTD started in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2005-11/aerovironment-global-observer AEROVIRONMENT GLOBAL OBERSVER] - Popsci.com, 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/aerovironment-global-observer-long-endurance-uav-wing-load-tests/16022/ AeroVironment Global Observer long endurance UAS completes wing load tests] - Gizmag.com, 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Aerovironment announced that the full-sized Global Observer wing had passed wing load testing.  The 53&amp;nbsp;m (175&amp;nbsp;ft) all-composite wing, which comes in five sections and is designed to maximize wing strength while minimizing weight, had loads applied to it that approximated the maximum loads it is designed to withstand during normal flight, turbulence and maneuvers.  In its third year of testing, the demonstrator had also undergone ground and taxi tests as well as taken a "short hop" lifting off the ground briefly during taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-observer-clears-wing-load-testing-346040/ Global Observer clears wing load testing] - Flightglobal.com, 11 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag10aug10"/&gt;

The Global Observer performed its first flight on 5 August 2010, taking off from Edwards AFB and reaching an altitude of {{convert|4,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one hour.  The flight was performed using battery power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-first-flight/16049/ Global Observer successfully completes first flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;The aircraft completed initial flight testing, consisting of multiple low-altitude flights, at Edwards AFB in August and September 2010.  This phase used batteries to power the hybrid-electric aircraft and approximate full aircraft weight and center of gravity for flight control, performance, and responsiveness evaluation.  Following this, the program team installed and ground tested the aircraft's hydrogen-fueled generator and liquid hydrogen fuel tanks which will power it for up to a week in the [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/AeroVironment_Global_Observer_Stratospheric_Unmanned_Aircraft_System_Completes_Initial_Flight_Testing_999.html AeroVironment Global Observer Stratospheric UAV Completes Initial Testing] - Spacedaily.com, 26 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flight of the Global Observer using hydrogen fuel occurred on 11 January 2011, reaching an altitude of {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-uav-first-hydrogen-powered-flight/17602/ Global Observer unmanned aircraft makes first hydrogen-powered flight] - Gizmag.com, 16 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2011, Global Observer-1 (GO-1), the first aircraft to be completed, crashed 18 hours into its 9th test flight.  AeroVironment said it was undergoing flight test envelope expansion and had been operating for nearly twice the endurance and at a higher altitude than previous flights when the crash occurred.  At the time, the second aircraft developed as part of the JCTD program was nearing completion at a company facility; the $140 million program was originally scheduled for completion in late 2011, but the crash delayed this by a year.  AeroVironment was looking for sources of incremental funding to provide a bridge between the demonstration and a future procurement program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/global-observer-crash/18321/ Global Observer UAS crashes during flight-testing] - Gizmag.com, 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/aerovironment-global-observer-crash-rattles-observers-0 AeroVironment Global Observer Crash Rattles Observers] - Aviationweek.com, 1 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Observer crashes during test flight |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/04/04/Global-Observer-crashes-during-test-flight/UPI-41741301921265/ |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |agency=United Press International|date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Pentagon closed the development contract for the Global Observer, the reason being the crash in April 2011.  The Global Observer was used as a technology demonstration, not a program for a functioning aircraft.  In April 2013, the Pentagon stated that no service or defense agency had advocated for it to be a program.  AeroVironment is currently in possession of the second prototype Global Observer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/04/pentagon-global-observer/ No One Wants the Pentagon’s Gigantic Hydrogen-Powered Drone] Wired.com, April 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2014, AeroVironment announced that it had teamed with [[Lockheed Martin]] to sell the Global Observer to international customers.  The partnership is focused around building "atmospheric satellite systems" around the UAV.  The Global Observer may compete for orders with the [[Boeing]] [[Phantom Eye]] liquid hydrogen-powered long endurance UAV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aerovironment-teams-with-lockheed-martin-on-global-observer-395675/ AeroVironment teams with Lockheed Martin on Global Observer] - Flightglobal.com, 7 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/2014-02-09/aerovironment-lockheed-martin-advance-global-observer-uas AeroVironment, Lockheed Martin Advance Global Observer UAS] - Ainonline.com, 9 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

== Current Model ==
The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005). Measuring help-seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, 39(1), 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M., McLean, J. P., &amp; Sheffield, J. (2009). Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes.

In [[mathematics]], an '''axiomatic system''' is any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[axiom]]s from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to [[logic]]ally derive [[theorem]]s. A [[Theory_(mathematical_logic)|theory]] consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of [[formal system]]. A formal theory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within [[model theory]]. A [[formal proof]] is a complete rendition of a [[mathematical proof]] within a formal system.

== Properties ==

An axiomatic system is said to be ''[[Consistency|consistent]]'' if it lacks [[contradiction]], i.e. the ability to derive both a statement and its denial from the system's axioms.

In an axiomatic system, an axiom is called ''[[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]]'' if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system. A system will be called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent. Although independence is not a necessary requirement for a system, consistency usually is, but see neutrosophic logic.

An axiomatic system will be called ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' if for every statement, either itself or its negation is derivable.

== Relative consistency ==

Beyond consistency, relative consistency is also the mark of a worthwhile axiom system.  This is when the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second, such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second.

A good example is the relative consistency of neutral geometry or absolute geometry with respect to the theory of the real number system.  Lines and points are undefined terms in absolute geometry, but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems.

== Models ==

A '''[[Model theory|model]]''' for an axiomatic system is a well-defined [[Set (mathematics)|set]], which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system, in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system. The existence of a '''concrete model''' proves the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of a system. A model is called '''concrete''' if the meanings assigned are objects and relations from the real world{{clarify|date=March 2018|reason=What does 'real world' mean in this context?}}}, as opposed to an '''abstract model''' which is based on other axiomatic systems.

Models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system. By constructing a valid model for a subsystem without a specific axiom, we show that the omitted axiom is independent if its correctness does not necessarily follow from the subsystem.

Two models are said to be [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] if a one-to-one correspondence can be found between their elements, in a manner that preserves their relationship. An axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called '''categorial''' (sometimes categorical), and the property of categoriality (categoricity) ensures the completeness of a system.

== Axiomatic method ==

Stating definitions and propositions in a way such that each new term can be formally eliminated by the priorly introduced terms requires primitive notions (axioms) to avoid [[infinite regress]]. This way of doing mathematics is called the '''axiomatic method'''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Set Theory and its Philosophy, a Critical Introduction" S.6; Michael Potter, Oxford, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A common attitude towards the axiomatic method is [[logicism]]. In their book ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] attempted to show that all mathematical theory could be reduced to some collection of axioms. More generally, the reduction of a body of propositions to a particular collection of axioms underlies the mathematician's research program. This was very prominent in the mathematics of the twentieth century, in particular in subjects based around [[homological algebra]].

The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. For example, mathematicians opted that [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s need not be [[Commutative ring|commutative]], which differed from [[Emmy Noether]]'s original formulation. Mathematicians decided to consider [[topological spaces]] more generally without the [[separation axiom]] which [[Felix Hausdorff]] originally formulated.

The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms]], the result of the axiomatic method applied to set theory, allowed the "proper" formulation of set-theory problems and helped to avoid the paradoxes of [[Naive set theory|naïve set theory]]. One such problem was the [[Continuum hypothesis]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] included is commonly abbreviated [[ZFC]], where C stands for choice.  Many authors use [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] to refer to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. Today ZFC is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].

=== History ===
{{Further|History of Mathematics}}

Mathematical methods developed to some degree of sophistication in ancient Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, apparently without employing the axiomatic method.

[[Euclid]] of [[Alexandria]] authored the earliest extant axiomatic presentation of [[Euclidean geometry]] and [[number theory]]. Many axiomatic systems were developed in the nineteenth century, including [[non-Euclidean geometry]], the foundations of [[real analysis]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s [[set theory]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s work on foundations, and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s 'new' use of axiomatic method as a research tool. For example, [[group theory]] was first put on an axiomatic basis towards the end of that century. Once the axioms were clarified (that [[inverse element]]s should be required, for example), the subject could proceed autonomously, without reference to the [[transformation group]] origins of those studies.

=== Issues ===

Not every consistent body of propositions can be captured by a describable collection of axioms. Call a collection of axioms [[recursive set|recursive]] if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is an axiom. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] then tells us that there are certain consistent bodies of propositions with no recursive axiomatization. Typically, the computer can recognize the axioms and logical rules for deriving theorems, and the computer can recognize whether a proof is valid, but to determine whether a proof exists for a statement is only soluble by "waiting" for the proof or disproof to be generated.  The result is that one will not know which propositions are theorems and the axiomatic method breaks down. An example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the [[natural number]]s. The Peano Axioms (described below) thus only partially axiomatize this theory.

In practice, not every proof is traced back to the axioms. At times, it is not clear which collection of axioms a proof appeals to. For example, a number-theoretic statement might be expressible in the language of arithmetic (i.e. the language of the Peano Axioms) and a proof might be given that appeals to [[topology]] or [[complex analysis]]. It might not be immediately clear whether another proof can be found that derives itself solely from the Peano Axioms.

Any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory, but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions, and even if it is, it is not likely to shed light on anything. Philosophers of mathematics sometimes assert that mathematicians choose axioms "arbitrarily", but it is possible that although they may appear arbitrary when viewed only from the point of view of the canons of deductive logic, that appearance is due to a limitation on the purposes that deductive logic serves.

=== Example: The Peano axiomatization of natural numbers ===
{{Main|Peano axioms}}
The mathematical system of [[natural number]]s  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is based on an axiomatic system first written down by the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] in 1889. He chose the axioms, in the language of a single unary function symbol ''S'' (short for "[[Successor function|successor]]"), for the set of natural numbers to be:

* There is a natural number 0.
* Every natural number ''a'' has a successor, denoted by ''Sa''.
* There is no natural number whose successor is 0.
* Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors: if ''a'' ≠ ''b'', then ''Sa'' ≠ ''Sb''.
* If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number it is possessed by, then it is possessed by all natural numbers ("''[[Mathematical induction#Axiom of induction|Induction axiom]]''").

=== Axiomatization ===

In [[mathematics]], '''axiomatization''' is the formulation of a system of statements (i.e. [[axiom]]s) that relate a number of primitive terms in order that a [[consistency proof|consistent]] body of [[Boolean-valued function|propositions]] may be derived [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] from these statements. Thereafter, the [[mathematical proof|proof]] of any proposition should be, in principle, traceable back to these axioms.

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''conceptual model''' is a representation of a system, made of the composition of [[concept]]s which are used to help people [[knowledge|know]], [[understanding|understand]], or [[simulation|simulate]] a subject the model represents. It is also a set of concepts. Some [[physical model|models]] are [[physical object]]s; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents.

The term ''conceptual model'' may be used to refer to models which are formed after a [[wikt:concept#Noun|conceptualization]] or [[generalization]] process.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social. [[Semantics|Semantic]] studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience.

== Overview ==
=== Models of concepts and models that are conceptual ===
The term ''conceptual model'' is normal. It could mean "a model of concept" or it could mean "a model that is conceptual." A distinction can be made between ''what models are'' and ''what models are made of''. With the exception of iconic models, such as a scale model of [[Winchester Cathedral]], most models are concepts. But they are, mostly, intended to be models of real world states of affairs. The value of a model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to a past, present, future, actual or potential state of affairs. A model of a concept is quite different because in order to be a good model it need not have this real world correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Frank Hutson (January 1992) [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Cause,_Effect,_Efficiency_%26_Soft_Systems_Models Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models] Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. With revisions and additions it was published in the ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'' (1993) 44(4), pp. 149–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In artificial intelligence conceptual models and [[conceptual graphs]] are used for building [[expert systems]] and [[knowledge-based systems]]; here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true.

=== Type and scope of conceptual models ===
Conceptual models (models that are conceptual) range in type from the more concrete, such as the [[mental image]] of a familiar physical object, to the formal generality and abstractness of [[mathematical model]]s which do not appear to the mind as an image. Conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent. A model may, for instance, represent a single thing (e.g. the ''Statue of Liberty''), whole classes of things (e.g. ''the electron''), and even very vast domains of subject matter such as ''the physical universe.'' The variety and scope of conceptual models is due to then variety of purposes had by the people using them.
Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication."&lt;ref name="Mylopoulos"&gt;{{cite book | first =  J. | last = Mylopoulos | author-link=John Mylopoulos|chapter = Conceptual modeling and Telos1 | editor1-first = P. | editor1-last = Loucopoulos | editor2-first = R | editor2-last = Zicari | title = Conceptual Modeling, Databases, and Case An integrated view of information systems development | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | citeseerx = 10.1.1.83.3647 | pages = 49–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental objectives ===
A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents. Also, a conceptual model must be developed in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the models users. A conceptual model, when implemented properly, should satisfy four fundamental objectives.&lt;ref name="Kung and Solveberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=20143.20149 |title=C.H. Kung, A. Solvberg, Activity Modeling and Behavior Modeling, In: T. Ollie, H. Sol, A. Verrjin-Stuart, Proceedings of the IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on comparative review of information systems design methodologies: improving the practice.

# Enhance an individual's understanding of the representative system
# Facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders
# Provide a point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications
# Document the system for future reference and provide a means for collaboration

The conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle. Figure 1&lt;ref name="Sokolowski"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sokolowski |editor1-first=John A. |editor2-last=Banks |editor2-first=Catherine M. |date=2010 |title=Modeling and Simulation Fundamentals: Theoretical Underpinnings and Practical Domains |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470486740 |oclc=436945978 |doi=10.1002/9780470590621}}&lt;/ref&gt; below, depicts the role of the conceptual model in a typical system development scheme. It is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed, the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly, giving way to future problems or system shortfalls. These failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to; lack of user input, incomplete or unclear requirements, and changing requirements. Those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling. The importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives/techniques.

== Modelling techniques ==
{{Main article|Conceptual model (computer science)}}

As systems have become increasingly complex, the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded. With that expanded presence, the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of a system is being realized. Building on that realization, numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created. These techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the users understanding of the system to be modeled.&lt;ref name="Science Direct"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYX-4GPVP8P-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2006&amp;_alid=1566452383&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5630&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=9090&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d8982c2440adcdec4575f8d0e0e4432f&amp;searchtype=a I. Davies, P. Green, M. Rosemann, M. Indulska, S. Gallo, How do practitioners use conceptual modeling in practice?, Elsevier, Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering 58 (2006) pp.358–80]&lt;/ref&gt; A few techniques are briefly described in the following text, however, many more exist or are being developed. Some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include: [[workflow]] modeling, [[workforce modeling]], [[rapid application development]], [[object-role modeling]], and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).

=== Data flow modeling ===

Data flow modeling (DFM) is a basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of a system. DFM is a fairly simple technique, however, like many conceptual modeling techniques, it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams. The [[data flow diagram]] usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information, but rather works to bring the major system functions into context. Data flow modeling is a central technique used in systems development that utilizes the [[structured systems analysis and design method]] (SSADM).

=== Entity relationship modeling (Ontology oriented) ===

[[Entity-relationship model]]ing (ERM) is a conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, which are a product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships. The entities can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; [[IDEF1X]], [[Bachman diagram|Bachman]], and [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]], to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects.

=== Event-driven process chain ===

The [[event-driven process chain]] (EPC) is a conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven process chain consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed. More specifically, the EPC is made up of events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics.

=== Joint application development ===

The [[dynamic systems development method]] uses a specific process called JEFFF to conceptually model a systems life cycle. JEFFF is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes a projects initialization. The JAD process calls for a series of workshops in which the participants work to identify, define, and generally map a successful project from conception to completion. This method has been found to not work well for large scale applications, however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E. J. | title = Joint application design (JAD) in practice | doi = 10.1016/S0164-1212(98)10080-8 | journal = Journal of Systems and Software | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–23 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place/transition net ===

Also known as [[Petri net]]s, this conceptual modeling technique allows a system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means. The petri net, because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory, is a useful technique for modeling [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent system behavior]], i.e. simultaneous process executions.

=== State transition modeling ===

State transition modeling makes use of [[state transition diagram]]s to describe system behavior. These state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes. Most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling. The use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for [[finite-state machine]]s.

=== Technique evaluation and selection ===
Because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual [[modeling language]] when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique. That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6 | title = A framework for empirical evaluation of conceptual modeling techniques | journal = Requirements Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Considering affecting factors ====

Building on some of their earlier work,&lt;ref name="early Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1145/944217.944243 | title = Evaluating modeling techniques based on models of learning | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 79–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the conceptual model must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, the characteristics of the models users, and the conceptual model languages specific task.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The conceptual models content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the techniques ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the models users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the conceptual models complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that systems realization. The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve to completely different types of conceptual modeling languages.

==== Considering affected variables ====

Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create a "new product", or whether the technique will only bring about a more intimate understanding of the system being modeled. The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective. A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a [[system model]] which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective.

When deciding which conceptual technique to use, the recommendations of Gemino and Wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question. Understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to a more informed selection of a technique that properly addresses that particular model. In summary, when deciding between modeling techniques, answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations.

# What content will the conceptual model represent?
# How will the conceptual model be presented?
# Who will be using or participating in the conceptual model?
# How will the conceptual model describe the system?
# What is the conceptual models focus of observation?
# Will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system?

Another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide a rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness.

==Models in philosophy and science==

=== Mental model ===
{{Further information|Mental model|Representation (psychology)|Cognitive model}}
In cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, a mental model is a representation of something in the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Mental Representation:The Computational Theory of Mind, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/]&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[mental model]] may also refer to a nonphysical external model of the mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Models and Usability, Depaul University, Cognitive Psychology 404, Nov, 15, 1999, Mary Jo Davidson, Laura Dove, Julie Weltz, [http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical models ===
A metaphysical model is a type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope; a metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Matthew H. |editor2-last=Yudell |editor2-first=Zanja |date=2017 |title=Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Science: New Essays |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199363209 |oclc=956947667 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that it [[explanation|explains]] the answers to fundamental questions such as whether [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[mind]] are one or two [[Physical substance|substance]]s; or whether or not humans have [[free will]].

=== Conceptual model vs. semantics model ===
{{confusing|section|reason=the poor English might have a lot to do with it, but it is very hard to define even the basic idea of what the difference is between conceptual and semantic modelling. An example might help|date=October 2014}}

=== Epistemological models ===
An epistemological model is a type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the [[knowledge|known]] and the knowable, and the [[belief|believed]] and the believable.

=== Logical models ===
In [[logic]], a model is a type of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] under which a particular statement is true. Logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts, such as mathematical models; and ones which attempt to represent physical objects, and factual relationships, among which are scientific models.

[[Model theory]] is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A system that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra.

=== Mathematical models ===
{{Main article|Mathematical model}}

Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures.

A more comprehensive type of mathematical model&lt;ref&gt;DI Spivak, RE Kent. "Ologs: a category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation" (2011). PLoS ONE (in press): e24274. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0024274}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a linguistic version of [[category theory]] to model a given situation.  Akin to [[entity-relationship models]], custom [[category (mathematics)|categories]] or [[sketch (mathematics)|sketches]] can be directly translated into [[database schema]]s. The difference is that logic is replaced by category theory, which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling, especially useful for translating between disparate models (as functors between categories).

=== Scientific models ===
{{Main article|Scientific modelling}}

A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. A scientific model represents [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al way.  Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.  The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;edited by Hans Freudenthal (1951), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences]'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical models ==
{{Further information|Statistical model|Parametric model|Nonparametric statistics|Model selection}}
A statistical model is a [[probability distribution function]] proposed as generating data. In a [[parametric model]], the probability distribution function has variable parameters, such as the [[mean]] and [[variance]] in a [[normal distribution]], or the [[coefficients]] for the various [[exponent]]s of the [[independent variable]] in [[linear regression]]. A [[nonparametric statistics|nonparametric model]] has a distribution function without parameters, such as in [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], and is only loosely confined by assumptions. [[Model selection]] is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them; e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]].

In statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, a statistical model of customer behavior is a model that is conceptual (because behavior is physical),  but a statistical model of customer satisfaction is a model of a concept (because satisfaction is a mental not a physical event).

== Social and political models ==

=== Economic models ===
{{Main article|Economic model}}
In [[economics]], a model is a theoretical construct that represents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying parameters in a model or class of models.  A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.

== Models in systems architecture ==
{{Main article|System model}}
A system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure, behavior, and more [[View model|views]] of a [[system]]. A system model can represent [[View model|multiple views]] of a system by using two different approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach. The non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. The architectural approach, also known as [[system architecture]], instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models, will use only one integrated architectural model.

===Business process modelling===
{{Main article|Business process modeling}}
[[File:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction for Business process modelling&lt;ref&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). "Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process." in: ''3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, [[Budapest, Hungary]]'', June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''. Process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering. Process models are:
* Processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model.
* A description of a process at the type level.
* Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it.
The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations.

One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Rolland]] and C. Thanos Pernici (1998). "A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering". In: ''Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98, B. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1413'', [[Pisa, Italy]], Springer, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models in information system design==

=== Conceptual models of human activity systems ===
{{Main article|Soft systems methodology}}
Conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology (SSM), which is a method of systems analysis concerned with the [[Problem structuring methods|structuring of problems]] in management. These models are models of concepts; the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent a state of affairs in the physical world. They are also used in information [[requirements analysis]] (IRA) which is a variant of SSM developed for information system design and software engineering.

=== Logico-linguistic models ===
{{Main article|Logico-linguistic modeling}}
Logico-linguistic modeling is another variant of SSM that uses conceptual models. However, this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events. It is a graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events.

=== Data models ===

==== Entity-relationship model ====
{{Main article|Entity-relationship model}}
In software engineering, an entity-relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity-relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

==== Domain model ====
{{Main article|Domain model}}
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the [[problem domain]]). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity-relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

A ''''''conceptual schema'''''' is a high-level description of a business's informational needs.  It typically includes only the main concepts and the main relationships among them.  Typically this is a first-cut model, with insufficient detail to build an actual database. This level describes the structure of the whole database for a group of users. The conceptual model is also known as the data model that can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. It hides the internal details of physical storage and targets on describing entities, datatype, relationships and constraints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Data Modelling Tutorial", Stefano Grazioli, University of Virginia, {{cite web|url=http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702034254/http://webs.comm.virginia.edu/Grazioli/MSMITMod1/DataModelingTutorial/DMTutorialHome.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}, retrieved 20 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

A '''conceptual schema''' or '''conceptual [[data model]]''' is a map of [[concept]]s and their [[Relational model|relationships]] used for [[database]]s.  This describes the [[semantics]] of an organization and represents a series of [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s about its nature.  Specifically, it describes the things of significance to an [[organization]] (''entity classes''), about which it is inclined to collect information, and characteristics of (''attributes'') and associations between pairs of those things of significance (''relationships'').

Because a conceptual schema represents the semantics of an organization, and not a [[database design]], it may exist on various levels of abstraction.  The original [[ANSI]] four-schema architecture began with the set of ''external schema'' that each represent one person's view of the world around him or her.  These are consolidated into a single ''conceptual schema'' that is the superset of all of those external views.  A data model can be as concrete as each person's perspective, but this tends to make it inflexible.  If that person's world changes, the model must change.  Conceptual data models take a more abstract perspective, identifying the fundamental things, of which the things an individual deals with are just examples.

The model does allow for what is called [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] in [[object oriented]] terms.  The set of [[Instantiation (computer science)|instance]]s of an entity class may be subdivided into entity classes in their own right.  Thus, each instance of a ''sub-type'' entity class is also an instance of the entity class's ''super-type''. Each instance of the super-type entity class, then is also an instance of one of the sub-type entity classes.

[[supertype|Super-type]]/[[subtype|sub-type]] relationships may be ''[[exclusive relationship (programming)|exclusive]]'' or not. A methodology may require that each instance of a super-type may ''only'' be an instance of ''one'' sub-type. Similarly, a super-type/sub-type relationship may be ''exhaustive'' or not. It is exhaustive if the methodology requires that each instance of a super-type ''must be'' an instance of a sub-type. A sub-type named other is often necessary.

==Example relationships==
* Each PERSON may be ''the vendor in'' one or more ORDERS.
* Each ORDER must be ''from'' one and only one PERSON.
* PERSON is ''a sub-type of'' PARTY.  (Meaning that every instance of PERSON is also an instance of PARTY.)
* Each EMPLOYEE may have a ''supervisor'' who is also an EMPLOYEE.

== Data structure diagram ==
[[Image:Data Structure Diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Data Structure Diagram.]]
A [[data structure diagram]] (DSD) is a data model or diagram used to describe conceptual data models by providing graphical notations which document entities and their relationships, and the constraints that bind them.

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

===Modern tests===

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; The eight circuits, or eight "brains" as referred by other authors, operate within the human nervous system, each corresponding to its own imprint and direct experience of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Wilson, Alli, et al. (1977-95)&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and Alli include three stages for each circuit that details developmental points for each level of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alli, A. (2009). The Eight-Circuit Brain. Vertical Pool publishing, Berkeley, CA. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first four circuits deal with life on earth, and survival of the species. The last four circuits are post-terrestrial, and deal with the evolution of the species, [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] states of mind, and [[psychic]] abilities.  The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized.  Leary describes the first four as "larval circuits", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially.&lt;ref&gt;"Info-Psychology," Chapter 12, Timothy Leary, 1994, New Falcon Publications, Phoenix, Arizona, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization.

The term "circuit" is equated to a metaphor of the brain being [[computer hardware]], and that the wiring of the brain as [[circuitry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A.(1983). ''Prometheus Rising.'' New Falcon Publications, Reno, NV. Twenty-first Printing, (2009). Pgs. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary uses the eight circuits along with [[recapitulation theory]] to explain the evolution of the human species, the personal development of an individual, and the [[biological evolution]] of all life.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eight Circuits==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

Each circuit listed has each name from Leary's book "Exo-Psychology" after the preface,&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilson's book "Quantum Psychology" pgs.196-201.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; ''Note:In other books from Leary, Wilson, and Alli, the eight circuits have different names due to different interpretations and findings of each author. Please reference bibliography section for other works on labeling of each circuit.''

===1. (Leary)The vegetative-invertebrate circuit (Wilson)The oral bio-survival circuit&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===

This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival,  [[suckling]], cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] early in infancy. The imprint will normally last for life unless it is re-imprinted by a powerful experience. Depending on the nature of the imprint, the organism will tend towards one of two basic attitudes:
*A positive imprint sets up a basic attitude of trust. The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're not ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[oral stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psychosexual development]], and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong [[opioid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prometheus Rising, pg. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. (Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit (Wilson)The anal territorial circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.

The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states:
*Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an '[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of [[Fritz Perls]], to 'I'm OK' in the  [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]], and to [[Master–slave morality|master morality]] in the model of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Submissive, co-operative behavior.  Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'.

This circuit is activated by [[depressant]] drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[anal stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psycho-sexual development]]. This circuit introduces a 2nd spatial dimension; up/down.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/raw1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits:

*Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're OK]]. Friendly strength in the [[Interpersonal Circumplex]]. [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] in the [[Classical element|four elements model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Choleric in the [[Humorism|four humors model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're OK]]. Friendly weakness. [[Water (classical element)|Water]] in the four elements model. Phlegmatic humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly strength. [[Air (classical element)|Air]] in the four elements model. Sanguine humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly weakness. [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] in the four elements model. Melancholic humor.

===3. (Leary)The laryngeal-manual symbolic circuit (Wilson)The semantic time-binding circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental "map" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc.

This circuit is activated by [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[cathinone]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[caffeine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit supposedly appeared first when [[hominid]]s started differentiating from the rest of the [[primates]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], being heavily influenced by [[General Semantics]], writes of this circuit as the 'time-binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents&amp;nbsp;– including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved [[meme]]tically and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication.

===4. (Leary)The socio-sexual domestication circuit (Wilson)The socio-sexual circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first [[orgasm]]-mating experiences and tribal "morals". It is concerned with [[sexual pleasure]] (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", [[reproduction]], rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within [[society|social networks]]. This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. Some have pointed out that [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]]s such as [[MDMA]] seem to meet some of the requirements needed to activate this circuit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, [[somatic reprogramming]], etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A., "Quantum Psychology" (1990). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth circuit is consciousness of the [[Human body|body]]. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing [[aesthetic]] sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. Page V-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Experience of this circuit often accompanies an [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.

This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Hatha Yoga]], [[tantra]] and [[Zen meditation]]. Robert Anton Wilson writes, "Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the [[upper class]]es, with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC.

===6. (Leary)The neuro-electric circuit (Wilson)The metaprogramming circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
''Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). "Neuropolitics". Starseed Peace Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Prometheus Rising", Robert Anton Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh. In the subsequently published "Quantum Psychology", he reverted this back to the order proposed by Leary.''&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Seventh Printing, (2003). Page 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of "realities" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables [[Telepathy|telepathic communication]] and is activated by low-to-moderate doses of [[LSD]] (50-150&amp;nbsp;µg), moderate doses of [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===7. (Leary)The neurogenetic circuit (Wilson)The morphogenetic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

It deals with ancestral, societal and scientific [[DNA]]-[[Ribonucleic acid|RNA]]-brain feedbacks. Those who achieve this mutation may speak of [[past lives]], [[reincarnation]], [[immortality]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the [[collective unconscious]] in the models of [[Carl Jung]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; where archetypes reside.

Activation of this circuit may be equated with consciousness of the [[Pan (god)|Great God Pan]] in his aspect as Life as a whole, or with consciousness of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]], the biosphere considered as a single organism.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/cc-chap4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is activated by higher doses of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (200-500&amp;nbsp;µg), higher doses of [[peyote]], higher doses of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, yoga and [[meditation]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The circuit first appeared among the [[Hindus]] in the early first millennium and later reappeared among the [[Sufi cosmology|Sufi]] sects.

===8. (Leary)The neuro-atomic metaphysiological (Wilson)The non-local quantum circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The eighth circuit is concerned with [[Quantum mind|quantum consciousness]], [[Quantum entanglement|non-local awareness]] (information from beyond ordinary [[space-time]] awareness which is limited by the [[speed of light]]),  illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], shock, a [[near-death experience]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], high doses of LSD and according to Robert Anton Wilson almost any dose of ketamine&lt;ref name="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE0gRbyXllI&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL8F393A80E80263B3" /&gt;. This circuit has even been compared to the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[Indra's net]] from the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Leary's contribution==
Leary stated "They[The theories presented in ''Info-Psychology''] are scientific in that they are based on empirical findings from physics, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, astronomy, behavioral psychology, information science, and most importantly, neurology." &lt;ref&gt;Info-Psychology, pg 8., seventh printing, 2011 or Info-Psychology, pg. 7, third printing, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary called his book "science faction" or "psi-phy" and noted he had written it "in various prisons to which the author had been sentenced for dangerous ideology and violations of Newtonian and religious laws".&lt;ref&gt;''Info-Psychology, p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Leary propounded the basic premise of eight "brains" or brain circuits, he was inspired by sources such as the [[Hindu]] ''[[chakra]]'' system.

Leary claimed that among other things this model explained the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social conflict in the 1960s]], where the mainstream was said to be those with four circuits active and characterized by Leary as tribal moralists and clashed with the [[counter-culture|counter-culturists]], who were then said to be those with the fifth circuit active and characterized as [[individualists]] and [[hedonism|hedonists]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Leary's first book on the subject, ''Neurologic'', only included seven circuits when it was published in 1973. ''Exo-Psychology'', published in 1977, expanded the number of circuits to eight and clarified the subject. In it, he puts forward the theory that the later four circuits are "post terrestrial;" intended to develop as we migrate off this planet and colonize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leary|first= Timothy|date= 1977|title= Exo-Psychology|location= Los Angeles|publisher= Starseed/Peace Press Inc.|page= 103|isbn=0-915238-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once we begin space migration, according to Leary, we will have more ready access to these higher circuits. ''Exo-Psychology'' was re-published as revised by Timothy Leary with additional material in 1989 under the title ''Info-Psychology'' (New Falcon Publishing).

==Other authors on the eight circuits==
[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|130px|In [[chaos magic]] the eight circuits are sometimes related to the eight rays of the [[symbol of chaos]]]]
Leary's ideas heavily influenced the work of [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson's book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' is an in-depth work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Wilson's published screenplay ''[[Reality Is What You Can Get Away With]]'' uses and explains the model. Wilson, like Leary, wrote about the distinction between terrestrial and post-terrestrial life.

''Angel Tech'' by [[Antero Alli]], is structured around the Eight-circuit model of consciousness. Alli defines the word angel as "a being of light" and tech from the word "techne" meaning "art". The title is defined as "the art of being light".&lt;ref&gt;Alli, Antero. (1985) "Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection" New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes suggested activities such as [[meditation]]s and construction of [[Tarot|tarot-card]] collages associated with each circuit and imprint.

The model is fairly prominent in [[chaos magic]]. This concept has been detailed in ''"Chaotopia!"'' by [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], a leading member of the magic society [[Illuminates of Thanateros]]. Leary and Wilson were also members of the society. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Rolf Von Eckartsberg also appears to have been influenced by the model.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eckartsberg, R. (1981a). "Maps of the mind". In Valle, R. &amp; von Eckarsberg, R. ''The metaphors of consciousness''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthportals.com/Portal_Messenger/bohm2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

Experiments are still being performed at the [[University of Washington]] which have placed limits on the differential acceleration of objects towards the Earth, the Sun and towards [[dark matter]] in the [[galactic center]].

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle with an antimatter beam at CERN|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2015|volume=631|issue=1|page=012047|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/631/i=1/a=012047|bibcode = 2015JPhCS.631a2047K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/631/1/012047 |last1=Kimura|first1=M.|last2=Aghion|first2=S.|last3=Amsler|first3=C.|last4=Ariga|first4=A.|last5=Ariga|first5=T.|last6=Belov|first6=A.|last7=Bonomi|first7=G.|last8=Bräunig|first8=P.|last9=Bremer|first9=J.|last10=Brusa|first10=R.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

'''Fa''' ({{zh|s=法}};{{IPA-cmn|fà}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] that covers ethics, logic, and law. It can be translated as "law" in some contexts, but more often as "model" or "standard." First gaining importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought, the concept was principally elaborated in [[Chinese Legalism|Legalism]]. In [[Han Fei]]'s philosophy, the king is the sole source of ''fa'' (law), taught to the common people so that there would be a harmonious society free of chance occurrences, disorder, and "appeal to privilege". High officials were not to be held above ''fa'' (law or protocol), nor were they to be allowed to independently create their own ''fa'', uniting both [[Fiat (policy debate)|executive fiat]] and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei. (2003). Basic Writings. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 7, 21- 28, 40, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], a philosopher that would end up being foundational in [[Han dynasty]] [[Confucianism]], also took up ''fa'', suggesting that it could only be properly assessed by the Confucian [[Sage (Sophos)|sage]] (ruler), and that the most important ''fa'' were the very rituals that Mozi had ridiculed for their ostentatious waste and lack of benefit for the people at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robins |first=Dan |title=Xunzi |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Fall 2008 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and the School of Names==
The concept of ''fa'' first gained importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought. To [[Mozi]], a standard must stand "three tests" in order to determine its efficacy and morality.&lt;ref name="University of Idaho Press"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/308/mozipp.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these tests was its origin; if the standard had precedence in the actions or thought of the semi-mythological [[Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors|sage kings]] of the [[Xia dynasty]] whose examples are frequently cited in classical Chinese philosophy. The second test was one of validity; does the model stand up to evidence in the estimation of the people? The third and final test was one of applicability; this final one is a [[utilitarian]] estimation of the net good that, if implemented, the standard would have on both the people and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mozi. (2003). Basic Writings. Burton Watson, Ed. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The third test speaks to the fact that to the Mohists, a ''fa'' was not simply an abstract model, but an active tool. The real-world use and practical application of ''fa'' were vital. Yet ''fa'' as models were also used in later Mohist logic as principles used in [[Inference|deductive]] reasoning. As classical Chinese philosophical logic was based on [[analogy]] rather than [[syllogism]], ''fa'' were used as benchmarks to determine the validity of logical claims through comparison. There were three ''fa'' in particular that were used by these later Mohists (or "[[School of Names|Logicians]]") to assess such claims, which were mentioned earlier. The first was considered a "root" standard, a concern for precedence and origin. The second, a "source", a concern for [[empiricism]]. The third, a "use", a concern for the [[Consequentialism|consequence]] and pragmatic utility of a standard. These three ''fa'' were used by the Mohists to both promote social welfare and denounce ostentation or wasteful spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Chris |title=Mohism |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2010 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/mohism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8846">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|Visual representation of the Pythagorean theorem. Under the proposal the shape seen here would be drawn at vast size on the Siberian tundra using pine trees and fields of wheat.]]
'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is credited with an 1820 proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J.

Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13067">The '''General Group Problem Solving (GGPS) Model''' is a [[problem solving]] methodology, in which a group of individuals will define the desired outcome, identify the gap between the current state and the target and generate ideas for closing the gap by [[brainstorming]]. The end result is list of actions needed to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6wsVIuA03YC | title=Group Problem Solving | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Laughlin, Patrick R. | year=2011 | pages=1 | isbn=9781400836673 | quote=In the most general sense, a problem is a discrepancy between a current less desirable state and a future more desirable state.

==Beyond groupthink==
Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group [[decision-making]] models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the [[groupthink]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ggps_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2323226/The_GGPS_Model_Broadening_the_perspective_on_group_problem_solving | title=The GGPS Model: Broadening the perspective on group problem solving | work=Groups at work: Theory and research | date=2001 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | last1=Fuller | first1=Sally R. | last2=Aldag | first2=Ramon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scie/Career/Wisdom/groupthink1.htm | title=Groupthink | work=Psychology Today | date=November 1971 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | pages=43-46, 74-76 | quote=Groupthink is a psychological terminology used to describe the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive ingroup that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.

The symptoms of groupthink arise when the members of decision-making groups become motivated to avoid being too harsh in their judgments of their leaders' or their colleagues' ideas.  People would adopt a soft line of criticism and avoid conflict, even in their own thinking.

They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” &lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt; To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research.&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-29328-001 | title=Beyond fiasco: a reappraisal of the groupthink phenomenon and a new model of group decision processes | author=Aldag, R.J. | last2=Fuller | first2=S.R. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=May 1993  | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=533-552 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.533 | quote=...research does not provide convincing support for the validity of the groupthink phenomenon or for the suggestion that groupthink characteristics lead to negative outcomes. This review, coupled with evidence from other literature suggested by a problem-solving perspective and a direct examination of groupthink implicit assumptions, guided the development of a new, more general model termed the general group problem-solving model. This model incorporates a variety of antecedent conditions, emergent group characteristics, decision process characteristics, and group decision outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model includes elements of [[Irving Janis|Irving Janis's]] original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="decision_making"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment | publisher=Free Press | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1977 | isbn=9780029161609 | last2=Mann | first2=Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the '''GGPS-model''' first.

==The original groupthink model==
Janis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis" /&gt; In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term "groupthink" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.  Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims" /&gt;
All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see [[Groupthink#Symptoms|groupthink symptoms]]).

[[File:Groupthink schematic.JPG|Groupthink schematic]]{{or|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="decision_making" /&gt;

==The GGPS-model==
The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.
Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:

# The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ”too few alternatives”.  The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ”number of alternatives”. 
# Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc.

===Elements of the GGPS model===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
====Antecedents====

Three sets of [[Antecedent_(logic)|antecedents]] are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.

=====Decision characteristics=====
Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.

''Examples'': whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.

=====Group structure=====
Elements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.

''Examples'': whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of  mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.

=====Decision making context=====
Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.

''Examples'': whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.

====Emergent group characteristics====

The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.

=====Group Perceptions=====
These include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.

=====Group Processes=====
These include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, [[self-censorship]], and use of [[mindguard]]s.

====Decision process characteristics====

Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).

=====Problem identification=====
Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.

''Example'': if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.

=====Alternative generation=====
Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.

''Example'': in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.

=====Evaluation and choice=====
Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.

''Example'': whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.

====Outcomes====

The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.

'''''Decision outcomes''''': include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.

''Example'': if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.

'''''Political outcomes''''': include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.

''Example'': if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.

'''''Affective outcomes''''': include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.

''Example'': whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Gossen's Second “Law”''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810–1858), is the assertion that an [[Economics|economic]] agent will allocate his or her expenditures such that the ratio of the [[marginal utility]] of each [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] to its price (the marginal expenditure necessary for its acquisition) is equal to that for every other good or service.  Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[utility]]
* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service

== Informal derivation ==
Imagine that an agent has spent money on various sorts of goods or services.  If the last unit of currency spent on goods or services of one sort bought a quantity with ''less'' marginal utility than that which would have been associated with the quantity of another sort that could have been bought with the money, then the agent would have been ''better off'' instead buying more of that other good or service.  Assuming that goods and services are continuously divisible, the only way that it is possible that the marginal expenditure on one good or service should not yield more utility than the marginal expenditure on the other (or ''vice versa'') is if the marginal expenditures yield ''equal'' utility.

Assume that utility, goods, and services have the requisite properties so that &lt;math&gt;\partial U/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; is [[Well-defined|well defined]] for each good or service.  An agent then optimizes
:&lt;math&gt;U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;
subject to a [[budget constraint]]
:&lt;math&gt;W\geq\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the total available sum of money
Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], one constructs the function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n ,\lambda\right)=U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)+\lambda\cdot\left[W-\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
and finds the first-order conditions for optimization as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\lambda}=0&lt;/math&gt;
(which simply implies that all of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; will be spent) and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_i}=0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}-\lambda\cdot p_i =0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
which is algebraically equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\lambda~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
Since every such ratio is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the ratios are all equal one to another:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that, as with any maximization using first-order conditions, the equations will hold only if the utility function satisfies specific concavity requirements and does not have maxima on the edges of the set over which one is maximizing.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12173">The '''identity of indiscernibles''' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle that states that there cannot be separate [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[entity|entities]] that have all their [[property (philosophy)|properties]] in common. That is, entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if every [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. It states that no two distinct things (such as [[snowflake]]s) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  It is one of his two great metaphysical principles, the other being the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Both are famously used in his arguments with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]]. Because of its association with Leibniz, the principle is sometimes known as '''Leibniz's law'''. 

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to ''x'' (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed "the strong principle" or "the weak principle" by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Forrest | first=Peter | title=The Identity of Indiscernibles | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=Fall 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/identity-indiscernible/ |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] thought that the failure of [[substitutivity]] in intensional contexts (e.g., "Sally believes that ''p''" or "It is necessarily the case that ''q''") shows that [[modal logic]] is an impossible project.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Notes on Existence and Necessity." ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;40, No.&amp;nbsp;5 (March 4, 1943), pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] holds that this failure may be the result of the use of the [[disquotational principle]] implicit in these proofs, and not a failure of substitutivity as such.&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief". First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A.&amp;nbsp;Margalit. Dordrecht: D.&amp;nbsp;Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of [[Quantum contextuality|noncontextuality]] within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a [[logical]] principle, or merely an [[empirical]] principle.

==Identity and indiscernibility==
There are two principles here that must be distinguished (equivalent versions of each are given in the language of the predicate calculus).&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Note that these are all [[Second-order logic|second-order]] expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (are [[nonfirstorderizability|nonfirstorderizable]]).

#The indiscernibility of identicals

Principle 1 doesn't entail [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of = (or any other relation ''R'' substituted for it), but both properties together entail [[Symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] (see proof box). Therefore, Principle 1 and reflexivity is sometimes used as a (second-order) [[Axiomatic system|axiomatization]] for the equality relation.

Principle 1 is taken to be a [[logical truth]] and (for the most part) uncontroversial.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Principle&amp;nbsp;2, on the other hand, is controversial; [[Max Black]] famously argued against it.

The above formulations are not satisfactory, however: the second principle should be read as having an implicit side-condition excluding any predicates that are equivalent (in some sense) to any of the following:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
#"is identical to ''x''"
#"is identical to ''y''"
#"is not identical to ''x''"
#"is not identical to ''y''"
If all such predicates are included, then the second principle as formulated above can be trivially and uncontroversially shown to be a [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]]: if ''x'' is non-identical to ''y'', then there will always be a putative "property" that distinguishes them, namely "being identical to ''x''".

On the other hand, it is incorrect to exclude all predicates that are [[materially equivalent]] (i.e., [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]ly equivalent) to one or more of the four given above. If this is done, the principle says that in a universe consisting of two non-identical objects, because all distinguishing predicates are materially equivalent to at least one of the four given above (in fact, they are each materially equivalent to two of them), the two non-identical objects are identical—which is a contradiction.

==Critique==
===Symmetric universe===
[[Max Black]] has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provides a [[Model theory|model]] in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics: An Anthology''. eds. J. Kim and E. Sosa, Blackwell Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's argument appears significant because it shows that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe's plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous ''[[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'' argument), but that he ''could'' doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know.  What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind's [[essence]]. One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8sN_sdfBpGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Between Two Worlds: A Reading of Descartes's Meditations | first=John Peter | last=Carriero | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes' reasoning via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', such as the following argument based on a [[secret identity]]:

#Entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa.
#Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity; that is, they're the same person (identical) but people don't know this fact.
#[[Lois Lane]] thinks that [[Clark Kent]] cannot fly.
#Lois Lane thinks that [[Superman]] can fly.
#Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
#Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | title=Alter Egos and Their Names | first=David | last=Pitt | journal=The Journal of Philosophy | volume=98 | issue=10 | date=October 2001 | pages=531–552, 550 | doi=10.2307/3649468 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508170350/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | archivedate=2006-05-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Since in proposition&amp;nbsp;6 we come to a contradiction with proposition&amp;nbsp;2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either:
#* Leibniz's law is wrong; or
#* A person's knowledge about ''x'' is not a predicate of ''x''; or
#* The application of Leibniz's law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
#* What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
#* A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.
:::Any of which will undermine Descartes' argument.&lt;ref name="belief" /&gt;

[[Image:RudolfvonIhering2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rudolf von Ihering, one of the juris philosophers of the jurisprudence of concepts]]
The '''jurisprudence of concepts''' was the first ''sub-school'' of [[legal positivism]],&lt;ref name="ARCOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcos.org.br/livros/hermeneutica-juridica/capitulo-iii-o-positivismo-normativista/3-a-jurisprudencia-dos-conceitos/|title=A Jurisprudência dos Conceitos|author=Costa, Alexandre Araújo|publisher=Arcos|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|title=A importância da Jurisprudência dos Conceitos para a Metodologia Jurídica|author=Pepino, Elsa Maria Lopes Ferreira; Graviorno, Gracimeri, Vieira Soeiro de Castro; Filgueira, Sofia Varejão|publisher=Revista Depoimentos, da Faculdade de Direito de Vitória|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225127/http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, the written [[law]] must reflect [[concept]]s, when [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;that means that the interpretation of the words stated in the law must be guided by the scientific concepts that these words represent.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main representatives were [[Rudolf von Ihering|Ihering]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and [[Georg Friedrich Puchta|Puchta]].

This school was, thus, the preceding trigger of the idea that law comes from a dogmatic source, imposition from man over man and not a ''natural'' consequence of other sciences or of metaphysical faith.

Among the main characters of the ''jurisprudence of concepts'' are:
* formalism, search of rights in written law
* systemisation
* search for justifying specific norm with basis from more generic ones.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.ucp.br/seer/index.php/LexHumana/article/download/5/4|title=Evolução Histórica da Teoria Hermenêutica - do Formalismo do Século XVIII ao Pós-Positivismo|author=Rocha, Sérgio André|year=2009|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to this school, law should have prevailing sources based upon the legislative process, although needing to be proven by more inclusive ideas of a social sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36828">The '''just-world hypothesis''' or '''just-world fallacy''' is the [[cognitive bias]] (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring [[morality|morally]] [[justice|fair]] and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic [[justice]], [[destiny]], [[divine providence]], [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], [[Balance (metaphysics)|stability]], or [[cosmos|order]], and has high potential to result in [[informal fallacy|fallacy]], especially when used to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] people's misfortune on the grounds that they "deserve" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the [[English language]] in various [[figures of speech]] that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: "[[wikt:get what's coming to one|you got what was coming to you]]", "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]", "[[wikt:chickens come home to roost|chickens come home to roost]]", "everything happens for a reason", and "[[wikt:reap what one sows|you reap what you sow]]". This hypothesis has been widely studied by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] since [[Melvin J. Lerner]] conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="An Overview"&gt;Lerner, M.J. &amp; Montada, L. (1998). An Overview: Advances in Belief in a Just World Theory and Methods, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeiPBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World]'' (1–7). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has continued since then, examining the predictive capacity of the hypothesis in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade"&gt;Furnham, A. (2003). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727 Belief in a just world: research progress over the past decade]. ''Personality and Individual Differences''; 34: 795–817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
Many philosophers and social theorists have observed and considered the phenomenon of belief in a just world, going back to at least as early as the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] writing around 180 CE who argued against this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism", Book 1, Chapter 13, Section 32&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner's work made the just-world hypothesis a focus of research in the field of social psychology.

===Melvin Lerner===
Lerner was prompted to study [[justice]] beliefs and the just-world hypothesis in the context of social psychological inquiry into negative social and societal interactions.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface"&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M.J. (1998). Preface, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. vii–viii). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner saw his work as extending [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiments|work on obedience]]. He sought to answer the questions of how regimes that cause cruelty and suffering maintain popular support, and how people come to accept [[social norms]] and laws that produce misery and suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=M. |last2=Simmons |first2=C. H. |year=1966 |title=Observer's Reaction to the 'Innocent Victim': Compassion or Rejection? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1037/h0023562 |pmid=5969146 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerner's inquiry was influenced by repeatedly witnessing the tendency of observers to [[victim blaming|blame victims]] for their suffering. During his clinical training as a psychologist, he observed treatment of mentally ill persons by the health care practitioners with whom he worked. Although he knew them to be kindhearted, educated people, they often blamed patients for the patients' own suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental"&gt;Lerner (1980). ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''. Plenum: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner also describes his surprise at hearing his students [[wikt:derogate|derogate]] (disparage, belittle) the poor, seemingly oblivious to the [[structural violence|structural forces]] that contribute to poverty.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; In a study on rewards, he observed that when one of two men was chosen at random to receive a reward for a task, that caused him to be more favorably evaluated by observers, even when the observers had been informed that the recipient of the reward was chosen at random.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking"&gt;Lerner, M. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1978). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26009-001 Just world research and the attribution process: Looking back and ahead]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 85(5), 1030–1051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Existing social psychological theories, including [[cognitive dissonance]], could not fully explain these phenomena.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages"&gt;Maes, J. (1998) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_10 Eight Stages in the Development of Research on the Construct of BJW?], in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. 163–185). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.

==Early evidence==
In 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female subjects were made to watch a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, subjects were upset by observing the apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to derogate the victim. Derogation was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when subjects were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, subjects did not derogate the victim.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver" /&gt; Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

To explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of "contract" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt;

Lerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.{{citation needed|date = December 2011}}

There are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt; Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;

An additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Linden, M. &amp; Maercker, A. (2011) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives].'' Wien: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. (1984). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-04021-001 Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 47(3), 494–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Veridical judgment===
{{See also|Veridicality}}
Others have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, B. &amp; Lowe, C. (1975). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-26823-001 Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 31, 944–951.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay &amp; L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205–229). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt reduction===
Another alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. &amp; Jones, E. (1960). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Davis3/publication/9847296_Changes_in_Interpersonal_Perception_as_a_Means_of_Reducing_Cognitive_Dissonance/links/00b7d519bfb9563e9e000000.pdf Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance]. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 61, 402–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. (1964). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression]. ''Journal of Personality'', 1964, 32, 531–549.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Kenrick, D. T., &amp; Hoerig, J. H. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-26028-001 Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(6), 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

===Discomfort reduction===

Alternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169–170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.&lt;ref name="Hafer2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=Bègue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429–444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional evidence==
After Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character.&lt;ref&gt;Reichle, B., Schneider, A., &amp; Montada, L. (1998). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_4 How do observers of victimization preserve their belief in a just world cognitively or actionally?] In L. Montada &amp; M. J. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 55–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, social psychologists [[Zick Rubin]] and Letitia Anne Peplau developed a measure of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, A. (1973). [https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00104.x Belief in a just world and reactions to another's lot: A study of participants in the national draft lottery]. ''Journal of Social Issues'', 29, 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure and its revised form published in 1975 allowed for the study of individual differences in just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name = "RubinPeplau1975"&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, L.A. (1975). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073011/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Publications_files/Rubin%20%26%20Peplau%201975s.pdf Who believes in a just world?] ''Journal of Social Issues'', 31, 65–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the subsequent research on the just-world hypothesis used these [[psychometrics|measurement scales]].

===Violence===
Researchers have looked at how observers react to victims of [[rape]] and other [[violence]]. In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R., Timko, C., &amp; Carli, L. L. (1985). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Timko/publication/223081344_Cognitive_biases_in_blaming_the_victim/links/59dd3d88aca272b698e141ab/Cognitive-biases-in-blaming-the-victim.pdf Cognitive biases in blaming the victim]. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 21(2), 161–177.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carli, L. L. (1999). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.830.8628&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(8), 966–979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]]. One study found that observers' labels of blame of female victims of relationship violence increase with the intimacy of the relationship. Observers blamed the perpetrator only in the most significant case of violence, in which a male struck an acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, G., &amp; Feldman, N. S. (1984). [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1984.2.4.339 Blaming the victim versus blaming the perpetrator:An attributional analysis of spouse abuse]. ''Symposium A Quarterly Journal In Modern Foreign Literatures'', 2(4), 339–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
Researchers have employed the just-world hypothesis to understand [[bullying]]. Given other research on beliefs in a just world, it would be expected that observers would derogate and blame bullying victims, but the opposite has been found: individuals high in just-world belief have stronger anti-bullying [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, C. L., Elder, T., Gater, J., &amp; Johnson, E. (2010). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000709909X479105 The association between adolescents' beliefs in a just world and their attitudes to victims of bullying]. ''The British journal of educational psychology'', 80(Pt 2), 183–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that strong belief in a just world is associated with lower levels of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2008). School Bullying. ''European Psychologist'', 13(4), 248254.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in keeping with Lerner's understanding of belief in a just world as functioning as a "contract" that governs behavior.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt; There is additional evidence that belief in a just world is protective of the well-being of children and adolescents in the school environment,&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., Kamble, S. V., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2009). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615800902729242 Belief in a just world and well-being of bullies, victims and defenders: a study with Portuguese and Indian students]. Anxiety, stress, and coping, 22(5), 497–508.&lt;/ref&gt; as has been shown for the [[#Positive health effects|general population]].

===Illness===
Other researchers have found that observers judge sick people as responsible for their illnesses. One experiment showed that persons suffering from a variety of illnesses were derogated on a measure of attractiveness more than healthy individuals were. In comparison to healthy people, victim derogation was found for persons presenting with indigestion, pneumonia, and stomach cancer. Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruman, J. C., &amp; Sloan, R. P. (1983). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp0401_4 Disease as Justice: Perceptions of the Victims of Physical Illness]. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 4(1), 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of [[AIDS]] victims.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS"&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1992). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679204500303 Sphere-specific just world beliefs and attitudes to AIDS]. Human Relations, 45, 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
More recently, researchers have explored how people react to [[poverty]] through the lens of the just-world hypothesis. Strong belief in a just world is associated with blaming the poor, with weak belief in a just world associated with identifying external causes of poverty including world economic systems, [[war]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., Wagstaff, G. F., Newton, J. T., &amp; Harrison, K. R. (1990).

[http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-29152-001 The Just World and the Third World: British explanations for poverty abroad]. ''The Journal of social psychology'', 6. Heldref Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self as victim===
{{See also|Psychological response to rape|Self blame}}
Some research on belief in a just world has examined how people react when they themselves are victimized. An early paper by Dr. Ronnie Janoff-Bulman found that rape victims often blame their own behavior, but not their own characteristics, for their [[victimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R. (1979). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22629118_Characterological_versus_behavioral_self-blame_Inquiries_into_depression_and_rape/links/54244b5b0cf238c6ea6eac09.pdf Characterological versus behavioral self-blame: inquiries into depression and rape]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 37(10), 1798–809.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that this may be because blaming one's own behavior makes an event more [[locus of control|controllable]].

These studies on victims of [[#Violence|violence]], [[#Illness|illness]], and [[#Poverty|poverty]] and others like them have provided consistent support for the link between observers' just-world beliefs and their tendency to blame victims for their suffering.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; As a result, the existence of the just-world hypothesis as a psychological phenomenon has become widely accepted.

==Theoretical refinement==
Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world,&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C., Lipkus, I. M., Sallay, H., &amp; Goch, I. (2001). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000556 A just and unjust world: Structure and validity of different world beliefs].

Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 43–53). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS" /&gt; An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with [[Just-world hypothesis#Positive mental health effects|positive mental health]].&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal" /&gt;

==Correlates==
Researchers have used measures of [[belief]] in a just world to look at correlates of high and low levels of belief in a just world.

Limited studies have examined ideological correlates of the belief in a just world. These studies have found sociopolitical correlates of just-world beliefs, including [[right-wing authoritarianism]] and the [[protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A. J., Burroughs, T., &amp; Nguyen, T. (1999). [https://sites.google.com/site/alambertpsychology/publications/Lambertetal-riskperception.pdf Perceptions of risk and the buffering hypothesis: The role of just world beliefs and right wing authoritarianism]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(6), 643–656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1989).

''British Journal of Social Psychology'', 28, 365–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of [[religiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900002245 Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375–382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07654-003 Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events]. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of demographic differences, including [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]] differences, have not shown systematic differences, but do suggest racial differences, with blacks and African Americans having the lowest levels of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, L., &amp; Cann, A. (1994). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1994.9923011 Differences in assumptions about a just world: ethnicity and point of view].

The development of measures of just-world beliefs has also allowed researchers to assess cross-cultural differences in just-world beliefs. Much research conducted shows that beliefs in a just world are evident cross-culturally. One study tested beliefs in a just world of students in 12 countries. This study found that in countries where the majority of inhabitants are powerless, belief in a just world tends to be weaker than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1993). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1993.9712149 Just world beliefs in twelve societies]. ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 133, 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the theory of the just-world hypothesis because the powerless have had more personal and societal experiences that provided evidence that the world is not just and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1992). Relationship knowledge and attitudes towards AIDS. ''Psychological Reports'', 71, 1149–1150.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=I assume you mean to say 'neither just nor predictable.'|date=February 2014}}

Belief in unjust world has been linked to increased self-handicapping, criminality, defensive coping, anger and perceived future risk. It may also serve as ego-protective belief for certain individuals by justifying maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lench|first1=Chang|title=Belief in an Unjust World: When Beliefs in a Just World Fail|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2007|volume=89|issue=2|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/00223890701468477|pmid=17764390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=Dariusz|title=The belief in an unjust world: An egotistic delusion|journal=Social Justice Research|date=1996|volume=9|issue=3|pages=213–221|doi=10.1007/BF02197248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

===Positive mental health effects===
Although much of the initial work on belief in a just world focused on its negative social effects, other research suggests that belief in a just world is good, and even necessary, for [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C. (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sbKCnhCPaSgC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20justice%20motive%20as%20a%20personal%20resource%3A%20dealing%20with%20challenges%20and%20critical%20life%20events%22 The justice motive as a personal resource: dealing with challenges and critical life events].'' New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a just world is associated with greater [[life satisfaction]] and well-being and less depressive affect.&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal"&gt;Lipkus, I. M., Dalbert, C., &amp; Siegler, I. C. (1996). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167296227002 The Importance of Distinguishing the Belief in a Just World for Self Versus for Others: Implications for Psychological Well-Being]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 22(7), 666–677.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, C., Benson, D. E., &amp; Snyder, C. (1990). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1389045 Belief in a just world and depression]. ''Sociological Perspective'', 25, 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are actively exploring the reasons why the belief in a just world might have this relationship to mental health; it has been suggested that such beliefs could be a personal resource or [[coping (psychology)|coping strategy]] that buffers [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with daily life and with [[psychological trauma|traumatic events]].&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner"&gt;Hafer, C., &amp; Olson, J. (1998). Individual differences in beliefs in a just world and responses to personal misfortune. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 65–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that belief in a just world can be understood as a [[positive illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., &amp; Brown, J. (1988). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c6/b13d227783a3466d7a0903d9ebb111904502.pdf Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies also show that beliefs in a just world are correlated with internal [[locus of control]].&lt;ref name="RubinPeplau1975" /&gt; Strong belief in a just world is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life.&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner" /&gt; This may be one way in which belief in a just world affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs in a just world for oneself. Beliefs in a just world for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R., &amp; Douglas, K. (2005). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690500070X Justice for all, or just for me? More evidence of the importance of the self-other distinction in just-world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39(3), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International research===

A '''knowledge arena''' is a virtual space where individuals can manipulate [[concept]]s and relationships to form a [[concept map]]. Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called "off-loading" by McAleese.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R ( 1988) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: reflection in action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6,1,1&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept map]] is a form of  a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on [[graph theory]]. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by ''typed links'' or ''edges''.  (See [[Graph theory]].) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.

Many different claims have been made for the utility of the [[concept map]]. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual ''knows''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[Image:Pozytyw i negatyw.jpg|thumb|Color positive picture (A) and negative (B), monochrome positive picture (C) and negative (D)]]

In [[photography]], a '''negative''' is an image, usually on a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film, in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. This reversed order occurs because the extremely light-sensitive chemicals a camera film must use to capture an image quickly enough for ordinary picture-taking are darkened, rather than bleached, by exposure to light and subsequent [[photographic processing]].

In the case of color negatives, the colors are also reversed into their respective [[complementary color]]s. Typical color negatives have an overall dull orange tint due to an automatic color-masking feature that ultimately results in improved color reproduction.

Negatives are normally used to make positive prints on photographic paper by projecting the negative onto the paper with a [[photographic enlarger]] or making a [[contact print]]. The paper is also darkened in proportion to its exposure to light, so a second reversal results which restores light and dark to their normal order.

Negatives were once commonly made [[photographic plate|on a thin sheet of glass]] rather than a plastic film, and [[calotype|some of the earliest negatives]] were made on paper.

It is incorrect to call an image a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. Transparent prints can be made by printing a negative onto special [[release print|positive film]], as is done to make traditional [[motion picture]] film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by [[reversal film|reversal processing]], which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. Positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or diapositives, and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a [[slide projector]] or [[Slide viewer|magnifying viewer]] they are commonly called slides.

A [[positive (photography)|positive]] image is a normal image. A negative image is a total inversion, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa. A negative color image is additionally [[complementary colors|color-reversed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rFGT92vh6ZcC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=inverse+complementary+colours&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwyuGEq6DXAhXDKsAKHWvHDHkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Adobe Creative Suite 3 Bible|last1=Padova|first1=Ted|last2=Murdock|first2=Kelly L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=978-0470130674|location=|publication-date=11 February 2008|pages=|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with red areas appearing cyan, greens appearing magenta, and blues appearing yellow, and vice versa.

Film negatives usually have less contrast, but a wider [[dynamic range#photography|dynamic range]], than the final printed positive images. The contrast typically increases when they are printed onto [[photographic paper]]. When negative film images are brought into the digital realm, their contrast may be adjusted at the time of scanning or, more usually, during subsequent post-processing.

==Negative film==
{{Main|Photographic film}}
[[Image:Filmstrip.jpg|thumb|70px|left|A strip of four color negatives on [[35 mm film]]]]

Film for cameras that use the [[135 film|35 mm still format]] is sold as a long strip of [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]]-coated and perforated [[plastic]] spooled in a light-tight cassette. Before each [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]], a mechanism inside the camera is used to pull an unexposed area of the strip out of the cassette and into position behind the [[camera lens]]. When all exposures have been made the strip is rewound into the cassette. After the film is chemically [[photographic processing|developed]], the strip shows a series of small negative images. It is usually then cut into sections for easier handling. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] cameras use [[120 film]], which yields a strip of negatives 60&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] cameras capture each image on a single sheet of film which may be as large as 20 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm (8 x 10 inches) or even larger. Each of these photographed images may be referred to as a negative and an entire strip or set of images may be collectively referred to as "the negatives". They are the master images, from which all positive prints will derive, so they are handled and stored with special care.

Many photographic processes create negative images: the chemicals involved react when exposed to light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes in proportion to the amount of exposure. However, when a negative image is created from a negative image (just like multiplying two [[negative numbers]] in mathematics) a positive image results. This makes most chemical-based photography a two-step process, which uses [[Color print film|negative film]] and [[C-41 process|ordinary processing]]. Special films and development processes have been devised so that positive images can be created directly on the film; these are called positive, or slide, or (perhaps confusingly) [[reversal film]]s and [[E-6 process|reversal processing]].

Despite the market's evolution away from film, there is still a desire and market for products which allow fine art photographers to produce negatives from digital images for their use in alternative processes such as [[cyanotype]]s, [[gum bichromate]], [[platinum prints]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.bespoke.co.uk/press-room?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1921|title=HP Introduces Large Format Photo Negative Application for Fine-art Quality Professional Photo Edition|last=|first=|date=6 July 2010|website=Bespoke News Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
* The 1980s TV show ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' opening sequence famously shows various images of a countryside, [[covered bridge]], creek, farm buildings, and [[Betula papyrifera|birch]] trees that flip over to another image of the countryside fading into a negative image. The title appears and then a door in the image opens to reveal the episode.

In [[computer programming]], '''negative cache''' is a [[cache (computing)|cache]] that also stores "negative" responses, i.e. failures. This means that a program remembers the result indicating a failure even after the cause has been corrected. Usually negative cache is a design choice, but it can also be a [[software bug]].

==Examples==
Consider a [[web browser]] which attempts to load a page while the network is unavailable. The browser will receive an error code indicating the problem, and may display this error message to the user in place of the requested page. However, it is incorrect for the browser to place the error message in the page cache, as this would lead it to display the error again when the user tries to load the same page - even after the network is back up. The error message must not be cached under the page's [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]; until the browser is able to successfully load the page, whenever the user tries to load the page, the browser must make a new attempt.

A frustrating aspect of negative caches is that the user may put a great effort into [[troubleshooting]] the problem, and then after determining and removing the root cause, the error still does not vanish.

There are cases where failure-like states must be cached. For instance, [[Domain Name System|DNS]] requires that caching nameservers remember negative responses&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2308&lt;/ref&gt; as well as positive ones. If an authoritative nameserver returns a negative response, indicating that a name does not exist, this is cached. The negative response may be perceived as a failure at the application level; however, to the nameserver caching it, it is not a failure. The cache times for negative and positive caching may be tuned independently.

==Description==
A negative cache is normally only desired if failure is very expensive and the error condition arises automatically without user's action. It creates a situation where the user is unable to isolate the cause of the failure: despite fixing everything he/she can think of, the program still refuses to work. When a failure is cached, the program should provide a clear indication of what must be done to clear the cache, in addition to a description of the cause of the error. In such conditions a negative cache is an example of a design [[anti-pattern]].

Negative cache still may recover if the cached records expires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6961">The '''negative double''' is a form of [[takeout double]] in [[Contract bridge|bridge]]. It is made by the responder after his right-hand opponent [[overcall]]s on the first round of bidding, and is used to show both support for the unbid suits as well as some values. It is treated as forcing, but not unconditionally so. In practice, the negative double is sometimes used as a sort of catch-all, made when no other call properly describes responder's hand. Therefore, a partnership might even treat the negative double as a wide-ranging call that merely shows some values.

==Usage==

Using the modern negative double convention, it is understood that a double over an initial overcall is conventional, and ''not'' for penalties (but see [[#Playing for penalties|Playing for penalties]]). For example, using this convention, the following doubles would be regarded as negative, not for penalty:

*1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}) – Dbl
*1m – (1M) – Dbl
*1{{Hearts}} – (1{{Spades}}) – Dbl
*1M – (2m) – Dbl

In understandings regarding negative doubles, the emphasis is on major suit lengths. This is largely due to the special value that tournament play, especially the pairs game, places on major suits. Since the mid-1980s, the negative double has been used mainly to stand in for a bid in an unbid major suit.

Most partnerships using the negative double agree that it applies only through a particular level of overcall. For example, they may agree that the double of an overcall through 3{{Spades}} is negative, and that beyond 3{{Spades}} a double is for penalties.

At [[rubber bridge]] many players are reluctant to give up the penalty double of an overcall, and so do not use the double as conventional.

==History of terms used for this bid==

The term ''negative double'' was initially employed to distinguish it from the ''penalty'', or ''business'', or ''positive'' double, and signified a double over an opponent's opening bid whose meaning was a request for partner to bid his best suit. Around 1930, the term ''informatory double'' replaced ''negative double'', and that term later gave way to ''[[takeout double]]'' as it is used at present; the original term ''negative double'' fell into disuse.

In 1957, [[Alvin Roth (bridge)|Alvin Roth]] in his partnership with [[Tobias Stone]] appropriated the abandoned term ''negative double'' to denote a conventional double by responder over an overcall and gave it its current meaning.&lt;ref name=OEB7303&gt;{{OEB|7|303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was also briefly known as ''Sputnik'', because it was as new as the [[Sputnik|satellite of that name]] that the Soviet Union had recently launched. The term is still used sometimes in Europe.&lt;ref name =OEB7303/&gt;

==Forcing==

The negative double is generally [[forcing bid|forcing]], but opener might pass to convert the double to a penalty double. There is a special agreement called [[negative free bid]]s, under which (after the overcall) the bid of a new suit by responder is not forcing. However, most negative doublers play that a new suit response (or [[Contract bridge glossary#F|free bid]]), whether at the one level or higher, is forcing.

The negative double loses even more definition when it can be made with a very broad range of strength, from roughly six HCP up to game forcing values. In a pinch, players use it to "get by this round of bidding."

==Playing for penalties==

The negative double does not cause the partnership to completely lose the ability to penalize an overcall. There are two ways that the overcall can be doubled for penalties. For example:

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Dbl  – (Pass); '''Pass'''

Responder makes a negative double, and opener passes for penalties. This position is analogous to one in which a player makes a takeout double and his partner passes the double, converting it to a penalty double.

*1{{Diams}} – (1{{Hearts}}) – Pass – (Pass); Dbl – (Pass) – '''Pass'''

Responder passes the overcall, opener makes a re-opening double, and responder passes that double for penalties. This can be dangerous, because opener often doesn't know whether responder is simply too weak to make any call, or is hoping that opener can re-open with a double.

These situations are rare, though, and the more so because some five-card major partnerships play negative doubles ''over minor suit openings only.'' The rationale is that responder knows much more about opener's distribution after a major suit opening than after a minor suit opening, and can better judge whether to play in opener's major suit, to play for penalties by doubling, or to show a suit of his own.

==Support for unbid suits==

Partnerships have different understandings about the length in unbid suits that is shown by a negative double, and the understandings differ according both to which suits remain unbid and to the current level of the bidding. Nevertheless, the following are popular understandings:

*After 1{{Clubs}} – (1{{Diams}}),  a negative double is often understood to show at least four cards in both hearts and spades. The degree of support for this agreement has grown over the years. A poll of experts taken in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Bridge World Standard]] BWS84 poll results in [[The Bridge World]], July 1984, 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that about half concurred that doubler should have at least four hearts and at least four spades; a similar poll taken in 2000&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"&gt;[http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=bw_standard&amp;f=bwspolls.html BWS2001 poll results]&lt;/ref&gt; showed 80% in concurrence.
*After 1m – (1{{Hearts}}), a popular agreement is that a negative double shows exactly four spades. Responder would bid 1{{Spades}} with five or more. However, in 2000, this approach was favored by fewer than two thirds of polled experts.&lt;ref name="BWS2001 poll results"/&gt;
*After 1m – (1{{Spades}}), in contrast to the prior sequence, most experts prefer the negative double here to show at ''least'' four hearts – not ''exactly'' four hearts.
*After 1M – (2m), most play that a negative double shows at least four cards in the other major.
*After 1{{Diams}} – (2{{Clubs}}), few play that double shows at least four cards in ''each'' major, but most play that doubler shows at least one major at least four cards long.
*After 1{{Hearts}} - (1{{Spades}}) or 1{{Spades}} - (2{{Hearts}}), the negative double shows at least 4 cards in each minor because there are no unbid major suits.

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7070">'''Negative refraction''' is the name for an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] phenomenon where [[light]] [[ray (optics)|rays]] are [[refraction|refracted]] at an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] in the reverse sense to that normally expected.  Such an effect can be obtained using a [[metamaterial]] which has been designed to achieve a [[negative number|negative]] value for both (electric) [[permittivity]] ε and (magnetic) [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] μ, as in such cases the material can be assigned a negative [[refractive index]]. Such materials are sometimes called "double negative" materials.

Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive [[phase velocity]] (i.e. a positive [[refractive index]]), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative [[refractive index]]).

==Negative phase velocity==

Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a [[optical medium|medium]].  There are different definitions of NPV, the most common being Veselago's original proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veselago|first=Viktor G|date=1968-04-30|title=THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF SUBSTANCES WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY NEGATIVE VALUES OF $\epsilon$ AND μ|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1070%2FPU1968v010n04ABEH003699|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514|doi=10.1070/pu1968v010n04abeh003699|issn=0038-5670}}&lt;/ref&gt; of opposition of [[wavevector]] and (Abraham)  [[Poynting vector]], i.e. E×H; other common choices are opposition of [[wavevector]] to [[group velocity]], or to [[energy velocity]]. The use of "phase velocity" in the naming convention, as opposed to the perhaps more appropriate "wave vector", follows since phase velocity has the same sign as the wavevector.

A typical criterion used to determine Veselago NPV is that the dot product of the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector is negative (i.e. that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{P}\cdot\vec{k}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;); however this definition is not [[General covariance|covariant]].  Whilst this restriction is rarely of practical significance, the criterion has nevertheless been generalized into a covariant form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M. W. McCall|doi=10.1016/j.metmat.2008.05.001|title=A Covariant Theory of Negative Phase Velocity Propagation|journal=Metamaterials|volume=2|issue=2–3|page=92|year=2008|bibcode = 2008MetaM...2...92M }}&lt;/ref&gt; For plane waves propagating in a Veselago NPV medium, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, rather than the usual right-hand rule.  This gives rise to the name "left-handed (meta)materials". However, the terms left-handed and right-handed can also arise in the study of chiral media, so this terminology is best avoided.

We can choose to avoid directly considering the [[Poynting vector]] and wavevector or a propagating light field, and consider instead the response of the materials directly: that is, we consider what values of permittivity ε and permeability µ result in [[#Negative phase velocity|negative phase velocity]] (NPV).  Since both ε and µ are in general complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. [[Attenuation|lossy]]) material to display negative refraction.  The most general [[Victor Veselago|Veselago]] criterion applying to ε and µ is that of Depine and [[Akhlesh Lakhtakia|Lakhtakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = R. A. Depine and A. Lakhtakia |doi = 10.1002/mop.20127 |title = A new condition to identify isotropic dielectric-magnetic materials displaying negative phase velocity |journal = [[Microwave and Optical Technology Letters]] |volume = 41 |issue = 4 |pages = 315–316 |year = 2004 |arxiv = physics/0311029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although other less general forms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = P.

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_r|\mu|+ \mu_r |\epsilon| &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r, \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; are the real valued parts of ε and µ, respectively. However, negative refraction (negative refractive index) and negative phase velocity can be distinct from each other, even in passive materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Tom G.|last2=Lakhtakia|first2=Akhlesh|date=2009-06-12|title=Negative refraction, negative phase velocity, and counterposition in bianisotropic materials and metamaterials|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121|journal=Physical Review B|volume=79|issue=23|pages=235121|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.235121}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = J. Skaar |doi = 10.1364/OL.31.003372 |title = On resolving the refractive index and the wave vector |journal = [[Optics Letters]] |volume = 31 |issue = 22 |pages = 3372–3374 |year = 2006 |arxiv = physics/0607104 |bibcode = 2006OptL...31.3372S |citeseerx = 10.1.1.261.8030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the [[refractive index]] ''n'' is determined using &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n =\pm\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for ''n''.  However, in NPV materials, we reverse that convention and pick the negative sign to mimic the fact that the wavevector (and hence phase velocity) are likewise reversed.  Strictly speaking, the refractive index is a derived quantity telling us how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light, thus the sign of ''n'' must be chosen to match the physical situation.

==Refraction==
The principal symptom of negative refraction is just that – light rays are 
refracted on the ''same'' side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a suitably general form of [[Snell's law]].

[[File:Negative room.png|thumb|Schematic of a network of rooms where air (shown in blue) flows in one direction from the corridor into the negative pressure room (green). Exhaust air is safely removed from the area through a ventilation system.]]
[[vacuum|Negative pressure]] is generated and maintained by a ventilation system that removes more exhaust air from the room than air is allowed into the room. Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high). Except for this gap, the room should be as airtight as possible, allowing no air in through cracks and gaps, such as those around windows, light fixtures and electrical outlets. Leakage from these sources can compromise or eliminate room negative pressure.&lt;ref name="camil"/&gt;

A [[smoke testing (mechanical)#Infectious disease control|smoke test]] can help determine whether a room is under negative pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.state.mn.us/DocPolicy2/Document/500.522.htm Title: Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms], Minnesota Department of Corrections, Issue date 2007-07-03. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A tube containing smoke is held near the bottom of the negative pressure room door, about 2 inches in front of the door. The smoke tube is held parallel to the door, and a small amount of smoke is then generated by gently squeezing the bulb. Care is taken to release the smoke from the tube slowly to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube does not overpower the air velocity. If the room is at negative pressure, the smoke will travel under the door and into the room. If the room is not a negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward or will stay stationary.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

In [[western astrology|astrology]], a '''negative''', '''ceptive''', '''dispassive''', '''yin''', '''nocturnal''' or '''feminine''' sign refers to any of the six even-numbered signs of the [[zodiac]]: [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] or [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

These signs constitute the [[earth sign|earth]] and [[water sign|water]] [[triplicity|triplicities]].

==Introduction to signs==
In astrology there are two groups: positive and negative. These two groups also
include six individual signs that are called zodiac signs. The negative signs associated
with the zodiac are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. The positive
signs associated with the zodiac are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and
Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The twelve signs are divided into two
groups based upon one's exact time and place of birth. The negative and positive signs
alternate, starting with Aries as positive and Taurus as negative and continuing this pattern through the list of zodiac signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emerson|first=Michael|title=History of Astrology-Origins and Beginnings|url=http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|publisher=Astrology insight|accessdate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202075959/http://www.astrology-insight.com/astrologyinformation.htm|archivedate=December 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different types of sign terminology==
The signs negative and positive are referred to as a negative-sunsign or a
positive-sunsign. There are many terms used in astrology to differentiate the
two groups. In Chinese astrology, the two groups are categorized as yin and yang, corresponding respectively to negative and positive.  Standen explains that different astrologers may refer to signs by different names. For example, an astrologer may refer to positive signs as masculine and negative signs as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raaj Sudhanshu|first=Rajendra|title=Positive &amp; Negative Sign|url=http://www.subhanshu.com/astrology/positive-negative-sign.htm|publisher=Subhanshu.com|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each sign is divided into two main
types: active and passive. As a general rule, the active type will be called masculine and the passive type will be called feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standen|first=Anthony|title=Is There An Astrological Effect On Personality|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=1975|volume=89|issue=2|pages=259–260|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/vjrl20|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative Zodiacs==
Zodiac signs associated with the negative are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. Note that there is no value judgment attached to the terms negative or positive. They may be likened to polarities in a magnet: one side is positive and one side is negative. Neither side is "good" nor "bad"—they are merely different.

==The “Sunsign Effect”==
The sunsign effect is a pattern of alternating high and low extraversion-scores for
the 12 signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Rooij|first=Jan J. F.|title=Introversion-Extraversion: astrology versus psychology|journal=Department of Psychology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands|date=1993|volume=16|issue=6|pages=985–988|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994902437|accessdate=November 3, 2011|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90243-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introvert is a person who gains energy when alone and spends it when with other people. Extravert is a person who gains energy from socialization, expending it when alone. Jan J.F. van Rooij did an experiment on Introversion-Extraversion: astrology
versus psychology, to see if those in the negative sunsign were introverted and those in
the positive sunsign were negative. Van Rooijs did this experiment on those with
astrological knowledge and on those with no astrological knowledge. His results showed
that negative sunsign people are not that responsive to the outer world and are
accordingly not influenced that easily by astrological information. They rely more on
their own ideas and feelings, thus proving his point that people who are born with the
negative sunsign are introverted, and those born with the positive sunsign are
extroverted.

==Element Associated with negative signs==
Earth and Water are the elements attached to those who are in the negative sign.
Earth is the element of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Water is the element of Cancer,
Scorpio, and Pisces. Elements are the basic traits of the signs. They reveal the
fundamental aspects of the personality.
“Water signs are attuned to waves of emotion, and often seem to have a built-in
sonar for reading a mood. This gives them a special sensitivity in relationships, knowing
when to show warmth and when to hold back. At their best, they are a healing force that
bring people together -- at their worst, they are psychic vampires, able to manipulate
and drain the life force of the closest to them”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall explains that water signs are
more in tune with their emotions and are comfortable showing them. Water signs bring a
certain presence to a situation; they seek out the problem and fix it.
“Earth signs are sensual, meaning they engage with life through the five senses.
It takes time to sense the dense physical world, and earth signs can operate at a slower,
more thorough pace than the other elements. Theyʼre oriented toward whatʼs real, and
often this makes them very productive, able to create tangible results.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Molly|title=The Water Element|url=http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=December 1, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017135609/http://astrology.about.com/od/foundations/p/WaterElement.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earth signs are described by Hall as earthy people. These signs focus on the things
that connect us to the earth: things which bring peace, as opposed to focusing on the material world.

:''In colloquial usage, "negative temperature" may refer to temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the more familiar [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]] scales, with values that are lower than the zero points of those scales but still higher than absolute zero.''

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy state is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | footer    =

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

'''Paired opposites''' are an ancient, pre-Socratic method of establishing [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis and synthesis]] in terms of a standard for what is right and proper in [[natural philosophy]].

== Paired opposites in the proportions of units ==

[[Scalar (mathematics)|Scalar]] ranges and [[coordinate system]]s are paired opposites within [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Incorporating [[dimensions]] of positive and negative numbers and [[exponent]]s, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy.

Ancient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. [[Linear]] increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An [[acceleration]] in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetrically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. [[Arithmetic series|Arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]], and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as [[wikt:convergent|convergent]] or [[divergence (statistics)|divergent]] toward a position.

Though unit quantities were first defined by [[spatial dimensions]], and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added.

Rates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion

== Paired opposites as rhetorical device==

Paired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning "everything".  Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include "all creatures great and small," "working for the man every night and day," "more things in heaven and Earth" "searching high and low" "in sickness and in health".   In Greek literature, [[Homer]] uses the device when he lets [[Telemachus]] say, "I know all things, the good and the evil" (Od.20:309-10).&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|last2=Rendsburg |first2=Gary A. |title=The Bible and the ancient Near East |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-31689-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWmBUBre55QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Bible+and+the+Ancient+Near+East+gordon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UnLGWjWlY_&amp;sig=I0IV9A6pkpZjRWXR5rTCqfetph8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=as4xUNLHAsjNiwKCp4CYBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20merism&amp;f=false |edition=4th |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s notes to the NJPS Torah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East |last=Wyatt |first=Nicolas |page=244 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-567-04942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugate Variables==

In [[quantum mechanics]], as well as some fields of mathematics, [[conjugate variables]] are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other.  A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the [[uncertainty principle]] as &lt;math&gt; \Delta p \Delta x \geq \hbar&lt;/math&gt;.

The  '''Tree of Porphyry'''  is a classic device for illustrating what is also called a "scale of being". It was suggested—if not first, then most famously in the European philosophical tradition—by the 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]] Greek [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher and logician [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''scala praedicamentalis''.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] suggests the Porphyrian tree in [[Isagoge|his introduction (in Greek, "''Isagoge''")]] to [[Aristotle]]'s [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. Porphyry presented Aristotle's classification of categories in a way that was later adopted into tree-like diagrams of dichotomous divisions, which indicate that a species is defined by [[genus-differentia|a genus and a differentia]] and that this logical process continues until the lowest species is reached, which can no longer be so defined.  No illustrations or diagrams occur in editions of Porphyry's original work.  But, diagrams were eventually made, and became associated with the scheme that Porphyry describes, following Aristotle.

[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_01_intro.htm Porphyry's ''Isagoge''] was originally written in Greek, but was translated into Latin in the early 6th century CE by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].  Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/#WilOckBCa128D134 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] - Medieval Theories of the Categories&lt;/ref&gt;   Until the late 19th century, theories of categories based on Porphyry's work were still being taught to students of [[logic]].

The following very helpful passage by philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] gives some hint as to the history of the Porphyrian tree:

:In medieval education, the standard introduction to Aristotle's works was via Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', and division entered the educated consciousness in the form of 'Porphyry's Tree'. It is not clear that Porphyry himself, in the relevant passage,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "Porphyry, ''Isagoge'', trans. E. W. Warren (Toronto:  Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1975), 34."&lt;/ref&gt; went any further than Aristotle in recommending division. But his brief comment was developed into the Tree by medieval logicians. It appears in [[William of Sherwood|William of Sherwood's]] ''Introduction to Logic'' and is given the name '''arbor Porphyrii''' in the most popular medieval logic, [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Summulae Logicales''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "[[Norman Kretzmann|N. Kretzmann]], ''William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic'' (Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 54; Peter of Spain, ''Summulae Logicales'', [[Józef Maria Bocheński|I. M. Boche&amp;#324;ski]] (ed.) (Turin:  Marietti, 1947), 17-18."&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnaeus's system of static and discrete species was simply the result of filling in the abstract Tree with the names of actual species.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.  The passage quoted here is from pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself.  Still, scholars do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the ''Isagoge'' and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the ''Isagoge''.  But, of course, Porphyry was only following what was already in Aristotle, and Aristotle was following what was already in his teacher, [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;A number of Plato's dialogs contain the idea of division in them:  see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], [[Philebus]], [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]], [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] (book VII), and [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] for starters.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following Porphyrian tree consists of three columns of words; the middlemost (in boldface) contains the series of [[Genus|genera]] and [[species]], and we can take as analogous to the trunk of a tree. The extremes (the terms that jut out to the left and right), containing the [[differentia]]e, we can take as analogous to the branches of a tree:

[[File:Porphyrian Tree.png|frameless|center|400px|This image is an illustration of the notion of a Porphyrian Tree as it comes down to us today through the European philosophical and logical tradition.]]

The diagram shows the highest genus to be substance.  (Whether substance is a highest genus, really, is not in question here:  right now we are only going to discuss what the diagram shows, not whether what it shows is true or false.)  The technical term for a highest substance is "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/summum_genus ''summum genus'']".  So, substance is the ''summum genus'' as far as this diagram goes.  The diagram shows that the genus substance to have two differentia, namely, "thinking" and "extended".  This indicates that there are two species of the genus substance, thinking substance and extended substance.  The diagram does not give a term for the species of thinking substance (this would be "mind"), but it does give the term for the species of extended substance, namely, body.  That is, body is a species of the genus substance; body is that species of the genus substance that is extended.

Now that we have seen body as a species of substance, we treat body as a genus itself.  As a genus, it has two differentia of its own, inanimate and animate.  So, there are two species of body, inanimate body and animate body.  The diagram does not tell us what the term for inanimate body is, but it indicates a term for animate body, namely, animal.  Animal is an animate species of the genus body.

And, again, now that we have looked at animal as a species of the genus body, we look at animal now as a genus and consider its differentia, which are shown on the diagram to be irrational and rational.  Thus, according to the diagram there are two species of the genus animal, irrational animal and rational animal.  We are not told by the diagram what a term for irrational animal is, but the diagram indicates that a rational animal is a human.  Thus, human is a rational species of the genus animal.

Beneath human, however, there are no further species.  "This" and "that" if they are considered differentiae, are of a special kind that map the species human not onto a new species but onto particular humans.,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of "this" and "that" as universals/differentia, see [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "A. Consciousness", "I. Sense-Certainty:  or the 'this' and 'meaning' [Meinen]", translated by A. V. Miller, Oxford University Press, pp. 58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;   The particular human Plato is named in the diagram.  Plato is not a species (that is why his name is not in bold, unlike the species above).  So, human is the lowest species in this diagram.  The technical name for the lowest species in such a scheme is the "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infima_species ''infima species'']".  So, for this diagram, human is the ''infima species''.

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the concept of a '''possible world''' is used to express [[modal logic|modal claims]]. The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.

== Possibility, necessity, and contingency ==
{{Further|Modal logic#The ontology of possibility}}
Those theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the ''actual'' world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise [[Modal logic#The ontology of possibility|ontological status]] is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between [[proposition]]s and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the ''[[modal logic|modal status]]'' of a proposition is understood in terms of the ''worlds in which it is true'' and ''worlds in which it is false''. The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:

* '''[[Truth|True propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969").
* '''[[Falsity|False propositions]]''' are those that are ''false in the actual world'' (for example: "[[Ronald Reagan]] became president in 1969"). (Reagan did not run for president until 1976, and thus couldn't possibly have been elected.)
* '''[[Logical possibility|Possible propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in at least one possible world'' (for example: "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969"). (Humphrey did run for president in 1968, and thus could have been elected.) This includes propositions which are necessarily true, in the sense below.
* '''[[Contradiction|Impossible propositions]]''' (or ''necessarily false propositions'') are those that are ''true in no possible world'' (for example: "Melissa and Toby are taller than each other at the same time").
* '''[[Logical truth|Necessarily true propositions]]''' (often simply called '''necessary propositions''') are those that are ''true in all possible worlds'' (for example: "2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4"; "all bachelors are unmarried").&lt;ref&gt;See "A Priori and A Posteriori" (author: Jason S. Baehr), at ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]'': "A necessary proposition is one the truth value of which remains constant across all possible worlds. Thus a necessarily true proposition is one that is true in every possible world, and a necessarily false proposition is one that is false in every possible world. By contrast, the truth value of contingent propositions is not fixed across all possible worlds: for any contingent proposition, there is at least one possible world in which it is true and at least one possible world in which it is false." Accessed 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Contingency (philosophy)|Contingent propositions]]''' are those that are ''true in some possible worlds and false in others'' (for example: "[[Richard Nixon]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently false'' and "[[Hubert Humphrey]] became president in 1969" is ''contingently true'').

The idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of [[God]] and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be "the [[best of all possible worlds]]". [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "De Welt als Wille and Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens" p. 2222, see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;"Nor could we doubt that, if God had created many worlds, they would not be as true in all of them as in this one. Thus those who could examine sufficiently the consequences of these truths and of our rules, could be able to discover effects by their causes, and, to explain myself in the language of the schools, they could have a priori demonstrations of everything that could be produced in this new world." -The World, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; a major influence on Leibniz, [[Al-Ghazali]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''), [[Averroes]] (''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''),&lt;ref name=Kukkonen&gt;{{citation|title=Possible Worlds in the Tahâfut al-Falâsifa: Al-Ghazâlî on Creation and Contingency|author=Taneli Kukkonen|journal=[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]|volume=38|issue=4|year=2000|pages=479–502|doi=10.1353/hph.2005.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (''Matalib al-'Aliya'')&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name=Kukkonen/&gt; The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Saul Kripke]].

== Formal semantics of modal logics ==
{{Main|Modal logic#Semantics}}

A semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of [[Saul Kripke]] and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is ''possible'' is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is ''necessary'' is said to be true in all possible worlds.

== From modal logic to philosophical tool ==
From this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards &amp;ndash; including, most famously, the analysis of [[counterfactual conditional]]s in terms of "nearby possible worlds" developed by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] and [[Robert Stalnaker]]. On this analysis, when we discuss what ''would'' happen ''if'' some set of conditions ''were'' the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the ''set'' of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be near to another possible world W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the "further" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: "If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have." The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: "In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead." And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.

Today, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the [[philosophical zombie|Zombie Argument]], and [[physicalism]] and [[supervenience]] in the [[philosophy of mind]]. Many debates in the [[philosophy of religion]] have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the [[ontology|ontological]] status of possible worlds, provoked especially by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s defense of [[modal realism]], the doctrine that talk about "possible worlds" is best explained in terms of innumerable, ''really existing'' worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: ''given'' that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, ''what has to be true'' of the world, and just what ''are'' these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete ''worlds'' that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only "special" property that the ''actual'' world has is a relational one: that ''we'' are in it. This doctrine is called "the indexicality of actuality": "actual" is a merely [[indexicality|indexical]] term, like "now" and "here".) Others, such as [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] and [[William Lycan]], reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a "possible world" is conceived of as a complete ''description'' of ''a way the world could be'' &amp;ndash; rather than a ''world that is that way''. (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]], as "''ersatz'' modal realism", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic "on the cheap", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) [[Saul Kripke]], in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a ''stipulative'' account of possible worlds as purely ''formal'' (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.

== Possible-world theory in literary studies ==
Possible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, [[fictional universe]]. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time.{{vague|date=April 2015}} Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.

Literary critics, such as [[Marie-Laure Ryan]], [[Lubomír Doležel]], and [[Thomas Pavel]], have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its [[narrative]] and thematic concerns. [[Rein Raud]] has extended this approach onto "cultural" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;"Identity, Difference and Cultural Worlds", in Lang, V. &amp; Kull, K. (eds) (2014) Estonian Approaches to Culture Theory. Approaches to Culture Theory 4, 164–179. University of Tartu Press, Tartu, https://www.academia.edu/9128313/Identity_Difference_and_Cultural_Worlds&lt;/ref&gt; However, the metaphor of the "cultural possible worlds" relates to the framework of [[cultural relativism]] and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.

In [[logic]], the semantic '''principle (or law) of bivalence''' states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one [[truth value]], either [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]].&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logic satisfying this principle is called a '''two-valued logic'''&lt;ref name="Goble2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bivalent logic'''.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürlimann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hürlimann|title=Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BThojvh-XUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=Gabler Verlag|isbn=978-3-8349-1493-4|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] may or may not possess. It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=vii|series=The handbook of the history of logic|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the law of the excluded middle ==

The principle of bivalence is related to  the [[law of excluded middle]] though the latter is a [[syntactic]] expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ &amp;not;P". The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.&lt;ref name="Priest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.

== Classical logic ==
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

Assigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];&lt;ref name="SørensenUrzyczyn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.

== Suszko's thesis ==
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Future contingents===
{{main|Problem of future contingents}}
A famous example&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:

: Imagine P refers to the statement "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."

The principle of bivalence here asserts:

: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.

Aristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===Vagueness===
Such puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

: This apple is red.&lt;ref&gt;Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: "This" as opposed to a more-vague "The". If "The" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell &amp; Whitehead observe that this " this " indicates "something given in sensation" and as such it shall be considered "elementary".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:

: This apple is red and it is not-red.

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (§64, pp.&amp;nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:

{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.

Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The third "truth value"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".}}

The following are his "strong tables":&lt;ref&gt;"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q &amp; R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R  " This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19261">The '''principle of sufficient reason''' states that everything must have a [[Reason (argument)|reason]] or a [[cause]]. The modern&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:67" 
In modern times, the attention of philosophers was called to this law of Leibnitz, who, on the two principles of Reason and of Contradiction, founded the whole edifice of his philosophy.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See Théodicée, § 44. [[Monadology|Monadologie]], §§ 81, 82. —ED."&lt;/ref&gt; formulation of the principle is usually attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;There are numerous anticipations. One often pointed to is in [[Anselm of Canterbury]]: his phrase [http://12koerbe.de/pan/curdeus5.htm ''quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit''] and the formulation of the [[ontological argument for the existence of God]]. A clearer connection is with the [[cosmological argument for the existence of God]]. The principle can be seen in both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[William of Ockham]]. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. See chapter on Leibniz and Spinoza in [[A. O. Lovejoy]], ''The Great Chain of Being''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including [[Anaximander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Greek Achievement: The Foundation of the Western World|last= Freeman|first= Charles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Allen Lane|location= |isbn= 0-7139-9224-7|page= 152|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parmenides]], [[Archimedes]],&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"&gt;{{cite web |title= Principle of Sufficient Reason |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"&gt;[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton66"/&gt; [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Kara|title=Avicenna and the Principle of Sufficient Reason|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2014|volume=67|issue=4|pages=743–768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spinoza |last=Della Rocca |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn= 0415283302 |pages=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with "''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss (2007) "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit: Augments new and old for the Principle of Sufficient Reason" in ''Explication Topic in Contemporary Philosophy'' Ch. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton attributes this expression to [[Cicero]]; Hamilton 1860:66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]] identified the laws of inference [[modus ponens]] with the "law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent" and [[modus tollens]] with its [[contrapositive]] expression.&lt;ref&gt;From Hamilton 1860:241–242: “2°, "If the essential nature of an Hypothetical Syllogism consist in this, – that the subsumption affirms or denies one or other of the two parts of a thought, standing to each other in the relation of the thing conditioning and the thing conditioned, it will be the law of an hypothetical syllogism, that, – If the condition or antecedent be affirmed, so also must be the conditioned or consequent, and that if the conditioned or consequent be denied, so likewise must be the condition or antecedent. But this is manifestly nothing else than the law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent." &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The principle of this syllogism is thus variously enounced: ''Posita conditione, ponitur conditionatum, sublato conditionato, tlitur conditio''. Or, otherwise, ''a ratione ad rationatum, a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis, valet consequentia''. The one alternative of either rule being regulative of ''modus ponens'', the other of the ''modus tollens''. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Esser, Logik, I 91, p. 174. —ED. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; See Kant, Logik §§ 75–76 . Krug, Logik, § 82. —ED." See in particular Hamilton's discussion that leads to this quote starting at page 239ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity ''X'', if ''X'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''X'' exists.
*For every event ''E'', if ''E'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''E'' occurs.
*For every proposition ''P'', if ''P'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''P'' is true.

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of ''reasons'' or ''causes,'' for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different{{clarify|reason=needs elaboration|date=March 2016}}, however, depending on which interpretation is given.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to [[axiom]]s within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system
&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;. 
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be [[deductive reasoning|deducible]] from the set axioms at the base of the construction (with some theoretical exceptions: see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]]).

==Leibniz's view==
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical truths to be derived from the [[law of identity]] (and the [[principle of contradiction]]): "Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muhit|first=Abdul|title=Leibniz on Necessary and Contingent Truths|url=http://www.banglajol.info/index.php/AFJ/article/download/12936/9300|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary truths is that their negation is a contradiction.&lt;ref name="Principle of Sufficient Reason"/&gt;

Leibniz admitted contingent truths on the basis of [[infinitary]] reasons, to which [[God]] had access but humans did not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=G. W. Leibniz:  Philosophical Essays|year=1989|publisher=Hackett |location=Indianapolis|editors=Ariew, Roger and Daniel Garber, eds and trans}}, p. 94, ''On Freedom'' (1689?).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of [[closed system]], in which there is no 'outside' to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of [[Buridan's ass]].  Leibniz denied that the paradox of Buridan's ass could ever occur, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan's ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe....For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides.....Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17147 ''Theodicy'', pg. 150])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of [[absolute space and time|absolute space]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space.  Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that 'tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=H.G. |title=The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence |date=1956 |publisher=Barnes and Noble |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised [[laws of thought]], that held a place in European [[pedagogy]] of [[logic]] and [[reasoning]] (and, to some extent, [[philosophy]] in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of [[Leo Tolstoy]], amongst others, in the elevated form that [[history]] could not be accepted as [[random]].

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called ''necessary conditions'').&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T. Hobbes, ''Quaestiones de libertate et necessitate, contra Doctorem Bramhallum'', 7. Quoted in: A. Schopenhauer, [[On the Freedom of the Will]], c. 4. See also: [[John Bramhall]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such view could perhaps be also applied to indeterministic systems, as long as randomness is in a way incorporated in the preconditions.

===Hamilton's fourth law: "Infer nothing without ground or reason"===
Here is how [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Hamilton]], circa 1837–1838,&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface: "The Lectures on Logic, like those on Metaphysics, were chiefly composed during, the session in which they were first delivered (1837–8)." The lectures were assembled, with added footnotes marked by "—ED." by Mansel and Veitch and published in 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his "fourth law" in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

:"I now go on to the fourth law.

:"'''Par. XVII. Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent''':

:"XVII. The thinking of an object, as actually characterized by positive or by negative attributes, is not left to the caprice of Understanding – the faculty of thought; but that faculty must be necessitated to this or that determinate act of thinking by a knowledge of something different from, and independent of; the process of thinking itself. This condition of our understanding is expressed by the law, as it is called, of Sufficient Reason ('''principium Rationis Sufficientis'''); but it is more properly denominated the law of Reason and Consequent ('''principium Rationis et Consecutionis'''). That knowledge by which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit something else, is called the ''logical reason ground,'' or ''antecedent''; that something else which the mind is necessitated to affirm or posit, is called the ''logical consequent''; and the relation between the reason and consequent, is called the ''logical connection or consequence''. This law is expressed in the formula – Infer nothing without a ground or reason.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

:"'''Relations between Reason and Consequent''': The relations between Reason and Consequent, when comprehended in a pure thought, are the following:
:1. When a reason is explicitly or implicitly given, then there must ¶ exist a consequent; and, ''vice versa'', when a consequent is given, there must also exist a reason.

::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See Schulze, ''Logik'', §19, and Krug, ''Logik'', §20, – ED.&lt;ref&gt;From the index: "SCHULZE, G. E., KRUG, W. T." These are philosophers [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] (23 August 1761 – 14 January 1833) and [[Wilhelm Traugott Krug]] (22 June 1770 – 12 January 1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2. Where there is no reason there can be no consequent; and, ''vice versa'', where there is no consequent (either implicitly or explicitly) there can be no reason. That is, the concepts of reason and of consequent, as reciprocally relative, involve and suppose each other.

:"'''The logical significance of this law''': The logical significance of the law of Reason and Consequent lies in this, – That in virtue of it, thought is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly connected; each necessarily inferring the other. Thus it is that the distinction and opposition of possible, actual and necessary matter, which has been introduced into Logic, is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science."

==Schopenhauer's Four Forms==
{{main|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason}}
According to [[Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 20, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 29, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 36, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; "I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 38, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, page 212, S 42, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason" or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings "must be produced by an act of will which has a motive." As his proposition in 43 states, "Motivation is causality seen from within."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, S 43, trans. E. Payne, (Open Court Publishing Company, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed proofs of universal validity==
{{See also|Free will#Free will and views of causality|label 1=Views of causality (from the article on free will)}}
Several proofs have been prepared in order to demonstrate that the universe is at bottom causal, i.e. works in accord with the principle in question; perhaps not in every single case (randomness might still play a part here and there), but that causality must be the way it works at least ''in general'', in most of what we see; and that our minds are aware of the principle even before any experience. The two famous arguments or proofs were proposed by Immanuel Kant (from the form of Time, temporal ordering of events and "directionality" of time) and by Arthur Schopenhauer (by demonstrating how all perception depends on causality and the intellect).

Once it is agreed (e.g. from a kind of an "arrow of time") that causal interconnections, as a form of principle of sufficient reason, indeed must in general exist everywhere in the universe (at least in the large scale), ''backwards'' causality in general might then be precluded using a form of the [[paradox of free will]] (i.e. an event that has a future source might cause us to remove that source quick enough and thus causality would not work&lt;ref&gt;Likewise, announcing prophecies so that they will still be correct requires, in general, a lot of high-level research of human psychics, because sometimes they will be in accord with human determination and will be welcome, but sometimes announcing them without interference with the prophesied outcome is just impossible. The requirement of such high-level research, in every single case, seems in general to rule out the possibility of backwards causality in physics.&lt;/ref&gt;).

A '''process reference model''' is a [[Conceptual model|model]] that has generic functionality and can be used more than once in different models. The creator of a process model benefits from existing process reference models by not needing to reinvent the process model but only reusing it as a starting point in creating a process model for a specific purpose.

==Process model reuse==
During the identification of processes ideal for reuse, the designer needs to (1) Get approval (2) Provide Organization Scope Context and (3) Identify Process [[Standardization]] Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Marne de Vries, Alta van der Merwe, Paula Kotze and Aurona Gerber. (2011) A Method for Identifying Process Reuse Opportunities to Enhance the Operating Model. 2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spaceship Earth''' or '''Spacecraft Earth''' is a [[world view]] encouraging everyone on [[Earth]] to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.

From book IV, chapter 2: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|Depiction from the 15th century]]

The '''square of opposition''' is a diagram representing the relations between the four basic [[categorical proposition]]s.
The origin of the square can be traced back to [[Aristotle]] making the distinction between two oppositions: [[contradiction]] and [[contrariety]].
But Aristotle did not draw any diagram. This was done several centuries later by [[Apuleius]] and [[Boethius]].

== Summary ==
In traditional logic, a proposition (Latin: ''propositio'') is a spoken assertion (''oratio enunciativa''), not the meaning of an assertion, as in modern philosophy of language and logic. A ''categorical proposition'' is a simple proposition containing two terms, subject and predicate, in which the predicate is either asserted or denied of the subject.

Every categorical proposition can be reduced to one of four [[logical form]]s. These are:

'''*'''While the standard form "No S is P" is unambiguous, the form "All S is not P" '''is ambiguous'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David|title=The Art of Reasoning: An Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking|date=2014|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93078-8|page=150|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so is not a standard form: because it can be either an E or O proposition, it requires a context to determine the form.

Aristotle states (in chapters six and seven of the ''Peri hermaneias'' (Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, Latin ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', English 'On Interpretation')), that there are certain logical relationships between these four kinds of proposition. He says that to every affirmation there corresponds exactly one negation, and that every affirmation and its negation are 'opposed' such that always one of them must be true, and the other false. A pair of affirmative and negative statements he calls a 'contradiction' (in medieval Latin, ''contradictio''). Examples of contradictories are 'every man is white' and 'not every man is white' (also read as 'some men are not white'), 'no man is white' and 'some man is white'.

'Contrary' (medieval: ''contrariae'') statements, are such that both cannot at the same time be true. Examples of these are the universal affirmative 'every man is white', and the universal negative 'no man is white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every man is white, since some men are not white. Yet it is also false that no man is white, since there are some white men.

Since every statement has a contradictory opposite, and since a contradictory is true when its opposite is false, it follows that the opposites of contraries (which the medievals called subcontraries, ''subcontrariae'') can both be true, but they cannot both be false. Since subcontraries are negations of universal statements, they were called 'particular' statements by the medieval logicians.

Another logical opposition implied by this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (''alternatio''), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal statement of the same quality such that the particular is implied by the other.  The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every man is white' is true, its contrary 'no man is white' is false. Therefore, the contradictory 'some man is white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no man is white' implies the particular 'not every man is white'.&lt;ref&gt;Parry &amp; Hacker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sg84H6B-m4C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Aristotelian Logic]'' (SUNY Press, 1990), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen &amp; Nagel, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U09MjwDSZ0kC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Logic]'' Second Edition (Hackett Publishing, 1993), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary:
* Universal statements are contraries: 'every man is just' and 'no man is just' cannot be true together, although one may be true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one man is just, and at least one man is not just).
* Particular statements are subcontraries. 'Some man is just' and 'some man is not just' cannot be false together.
* The particular statement of one quality is the subaltern of the universal statement of that same quality, which is the superaltern of the particular statement because in Aristotelian semantics 'every A is B' implies 'some A is B' and 'no A is B' implies 'some A is not B'. Note that modern formal interpretations of English sentences interpret 'every A is B' as 'for any x, x is A implies x is B', which does ''not'' imply 'some x is A'. This is a matter of semantic interpretation, however, and does not mean, as is sometimes claimed, that Aristotelian logic is 'wrong'.
* The universal affirmative and the particular negative are contradictories. If some A is not B, not every A is B. Conversely, though this is not the case in modern semantics, it was thought that if every A is not B, some A is not B. This interpretation has caused difficulties (see below). While Aristotle's Greek does not represent the particular negative as 'some A is not B', but as 'not every A is B', someone in his commentary on the ''Peri hermaneias'', renders the particular negative as 'quoddam A non est B', literally 'a certain A is not a B', and in all medieval writing on logic it is customary to represent the particular proposition in this way.

These relationships became the basis of a diagram originating with Boethius and used by medieval logicians to classify the logical relationships. The propositions are placed in the four corners of a square, and the relations represented as lines drawn between them, whence the name 'The Square of Opposition'.

== The problem of [[existential import]] ==
Subcontraries, which medieval logicians represented in the form 'quoddam A est B' (some particular A is B) and 'quoddam A non est B' (some particular A is not B) cannot both be false, since their universal contradictory statements (every A is B / no A is B) cannot both be true. This leads to a difficulty that was first identified by [[Peter Abelard]]. 'Some A is B' seems to imply 'something is A'. For example, 'Some man is white' seems to imply that at least one thing is a man, namely the man who has to be white, if 'some man is white' is true. But, 'some man is not white' also implies that something is a man, namely the man who is not white, if the statement 'some man is not white' is true. But Aristotelian logic requires that necessarily one of these statements is true. Both cannot be false. Therefore, (since both imply that something is a man) it follows that necessarily something is a man, i.e. men exist. But (as Abelard points out, in the Dialectica) surely men might not exist?&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica'', and in his commentary on the ''Perihermaneias''&lt;/ref&gt;

: For with absolutely no man existing, neither the proposition 'every man is a man' is true nor 'some man is not a man'.&lt;ref&gt;''Re enim hominis prorsus non existente neque ea vera est quae ait: omnis homo est homo, nec ea quae proponit: quidam homo non est homo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abelard also points out that subcontraries containing subject terms denoting nothing, such as 'a man who is a stone', are both false.

: If 'every stone-man is a stone' is true, also its conversion ''per accidens'' is true ('some stones are stone-men'). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this 'a certain stone-man is not a stone' is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.&lt;ref&gt;''Si enim vera est: Omnis homo qui lapis est, est lapis, et eius conversa per accidens vera est: Quidam lapis est homo qui est lapis. Sed nullus lapis est homo qui est lapis, quia neque hic neque ille etc. Sed et illam: Quidam homo qui est lapis, non est lapis, falsam esse necesse est, cum impossibile ponat''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terence Parsons]] argues that ancient philosophers did not experience the problem of existential import as only the A and I forms had existential import.

: Affirmatives have existential import, and negatives do not. The ancients thus did not see the incoherence of the square as formulated by [[Aristotle]] because there was no incoherence to see.&lt;ref&gt;in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#AriForOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition''] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

He goes on to cite medieval philosopher [[William of Moerbeke]]
:In affirmative propositions a term is always asserted to supposit for something. Thus, if it supposits for nothing the proposition is false. However, in negative propositions the assertion is either that the term does not supposit for something or that it supposits for something of which the predicate is truly denied. Thus a negative proposition has two causes of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/notes.html#6 (SL I.72) Loux 1974, 206]&lt;/ref&gt;

And points to [[Boethius]]' translation of Aristotle's work as giving rise to the mistaken notion that the O form has existential import.

:But when Boethius comments on this text he illustrates Aristotle's doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he uses the wording 'Some man is not just'.  So this must have seemed to him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in English, but he wasn't bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#RewOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern squares of opposition==
[[Image:Frege-gegensätze.png|thumb|200px|Frege's square of opposition&lt;br&gt; The ''conträr'' below is an erratum:&lt;br&gt; It should read ''subconträr'']]
In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] argued for requiring existential import on both terms in particular claims (I and O), but allowing all terms of universal claims (A and E) to lack existential import. This decision made [[Venn diagram]]s particularly easy to use for term logic. The square of opposition, under this Boolean set of assumptions, is often called the modern Square of opposition. In the modern square of opposition, A and O claims are contradictories, as are E and I, but all other forms of opposition cease to hold; there are no contraries, subcontraries, or subalterns. Thus, from a modern point of view, it often makes sense to talk about 'the' opposition of a claim, rather than insisting as older logicians did that a claim has several different opposites, which are in different kinds of opposition with the claim.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' also presents a square of oppositions, organised in an almost identical manner to the classical square, showing the contradictories, subalternates and contraries between four formulae constructed from universal quantification, negation and implication.

[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]]' [[semiotic square]] was derived from Aristotle's work.

The traditional square of opposition is now often compared with squares based on inner- and outer-negation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.165900.1391710462!/menu/standard/file/2012%20Squares.pdf Westerståhl, 'Classical vs. modern squares of opposition, and beyond'],  in Beziau and Payette (eds.), The Square of Opposition: A General Framework for Cognition, Peter Lang, Bern, 195-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical hexagons and other bi-simplexes ==
{{Main|Logical hexagon}}

The square of opposition has been extended to a logical hexagon which includes the relationships of six statements. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-Opposition Theory ''Logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a "[[logical cube]]", belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called "logical bi-simplexes of dimension n." The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Square of opposition (or logical square) and modal logic  ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of [[Apuleius]] has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is bad, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is bad (or Some men are not bad), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are bad, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is bad, the universal negative on the other. [[Robert Blanché]] published with Vrin his Structures intellectuelles in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the [[logical hexagon]] which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[decision theory]], the '''sure-thing principle''' states that a decision maker who would take a certain action if he knew that event ''E'' has occurred, and also if he knew that the negation of ''E'' has occurred, should also take that same action if he knows nothing about ''E''.

The principle was coined by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|L.J. Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954), ''The foundations of statistics''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate were going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would buy if he knew that the Republican candidate were going to win, and again finds that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would ordinarily say. It is all  too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no other extralogical principle governing decisions that finds such ready acceptance.|source=p. 21}}

He formulated the principle as a [[Strategic dominance|dominance principle]], but it can also be framed probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Jeffrey |jstor=192456 |title=The Sure Thing Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |year=1982 |pages=719-730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt; and later Pearl&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Savage's principle is only valid when the probability of the event considered (e.g., the winner of the election) is unaffected by the action (buying the property). Under such conditions, the sure-thing principle is a theorem in the ''do''-calculus&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bayes networks]]). Blyth&lt;ref name="blyth-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blyth|first1=C.|title=On Simpson's paradox and the sure-thing principle|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1972|volume=67|pages=364–366|doi=10.2307/2284382}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a counterexample to the sure-thing principle using sequential sampling in the context of [[Simpson's paradox]], but this example violates the required action-independence provision.&lt;ref name=pearl-2015-r466&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=The sure-thing principle|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r466.pdf|website=UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report R-466|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is closely related to [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and equivalent under the axiom of truth (everything the agent knows is true).&lt;ref&gt;Samet, Dov.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~samet/papers/the-sure-thing-principle.pdf "The sure-thing principle and independence of irrelevant knowledge".

The Circumplex Model is a graphical representation of emotional states. Fundamentally, it is a circle with pleasant on the left, unpleasant on the right, activation on the top, and deactivation on the bottom. All the other emotions are placed around the circle as combinations of these four basic states. It is based on the theory that people experience emotions as overlapping and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2367156|year=2005|author1=Posner|first1=J|title=The circumplex model of affect: An integrative approach to affective neuroscience, cognitive development, and psychopathology|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=17|issue=3|pages=715–734|last2=Russell|first2=J.

It is of most interest in the business world, the workforce, or any other setting where the performance of a group is important. [[Joseph E McGrath]] enlarged the circumplex model to include group dynamics, based on the work of Shaw, Carter, Hackman, Steiner, Shiflett, Taylor, Lorge, Davis, Laughlin, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF GROUP TASK TYPES|url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aeechterhoff/wintersemester2011-12/vorlesungkommperskonflikt/mcgrath_groupinteractperfom_1984.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four quadrants in this model representing: generating a task, choosing correct procedure, conflict resolution, and execution, and again there are subtypes distributed around the circle. He used this model as a research tool to evaluate group task performance.

== Group dynamics ==
[[Group dynamics]] involve the influential actions, processes and changes that exist both within and between groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Forsyth
| first = D. R.
| publisher = Wadsworth

| location = New York
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group dynamics also involve the scientific study of group processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through extensive research in the field of group dynamics, it is now well known that all groups, despite their innumerable differences, possess common properties and dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social psychological researchers have attempted to organize these commonalities, in order to further understand the genuine nature of group processes.

For instance, social psychological research indicates that there are numerous goal-related interactions and activities that groups of all sizes undertake . These interactions have been categorized by [[Robert F. Bales]], who spent his entire life attempting to find an answer to the question, "What do people do when they are in groups?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To simplify the understanding of group interactions, Bales concluded that all interactions within groups could be categorized as either a ''relationship interaction'' (or socioemotional interaction) or a ''task interaction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| last = Bales
| first = R. F.

| location = New Brunswick, NJ

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Just as Bales was determined to identify the basic types of '''interactions''' involved in groups, [[Joseph E. McGrath]] was determined to identify the various '''goal-related activities''' that are regularly displayed by groups. McGrath contributed greatly to the understanding of group dynamics through the development of his '''circumplex model of group tasks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As intended, McGrath's model effectively organizes all group-related activities by distinguishing between four basic group goals. These goals are referred to as the circumplex model of group task's four quadrants, which are categorized based on the dominant performance process involved in a group's task of interest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown ===
The four quadrants are as follows: 
# '''''Generating''' ideas or plans''
# '''''Choosing''' a solution''
# '''''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict'' 
# '''''Executing''' a task''

To further differentiate the various goal-related group activities, McGrath further sub-divides these four categories, resulting in eight categories in total. The breakdown of these categories is as follows:

1. &lt;u&gt;'''''Generating''' ideas or plans''&lt;/u&gt;
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 1&lt;/u&gt;''' – Planning tasks''
** E.g. Generating plans
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 2&lt;/u&gt;''' – Creativity tasks''
** E.g. Generating ideas
2. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Choosing''' a solution&lt;/u&gt;''
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 3&lt;/u&gt;''' – Intellective tasks''
** E.g. Solving problems with correct answers
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 4&lt;/u&gt;''' – Decision-making tasks''
** E.g. Deciding issues with no right answer
3. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Negotiating''' a solution to a conflict&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 5&lt;/u&gt;''' – Cognitive conflict tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of viewpoints 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 6&lt;/u&gt;''' – Mixed-motive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of interest 
4. ''&lt;u&gt;'''Executing''' a task&lt;/u&gt;'' 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 7&lt;/u&gt;''' – Contests/battles/competitive tasks''
** E.g. Resolving conflicts of power 
* '''''&lt;u&gt;Type 8&lt;/u&gt;''' – Performance/psychomotor tasks''
** E.g. Executing performance tasks

=== Details ===
According to [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] and [[Kravitz]] (1982),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the four most commonly represented tasks in the group dynamics literature are intellective tasks, decision-making tasks, cognitive conflict tasks and mixed-motive tasks.

The circumplex model of group tasks takes the organization of goal-related activities a step further by distinguishing between tasks that involve cooperation between group members, cooperation tasks (Types 1, 2, 3 and 8) and tasks that often lead to conflict between group members, conflict tasks (Types 4, 5, 6 and 7).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, McGrath's circumplex model of group tasks also distinguishes between tasks that require action (behavioural tasks) and tasks that require conceptual review (conceptual tasks). 'Behavioural tasks' include Types 1, 6, 7 and 8, while 'conceptual tasks' include Types 2, 3, 4 and 5.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Visual representation ==
The circumplex model of group tasks is, evidently, a very detailed and complex model. To allow for a more thorough understanding of its properties, a visual representation of the model has been developed. (Need a diagram of the model)

== Further explanation ==
Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, [[Susan G. Stratus|Stratus]] and [[Joseph E. McGrath|McGrath]] (1994)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''theory''' is a [[contemplation|contemplative]] and [[reason|rational]] type of [[abstraction|abstract]] or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4y4DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=gRlsPCgq1L&amp;dq=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;f=false|title=Human Motivation, Metaphors, Theories, and Research|last=Reviews|first=C.

The word has its roots in [[ancient Greek]], but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.

Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMurray|first1=Foster |title=Preface to an Autonomous Discipline of Education |journal=Educational Theory |date=July 1955 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=129–140 |doi = 10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x |accessdate=3 March 2017 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} A theory can be a [[body of knowledge]], which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory [[Conceptual model|models]]. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Gary |title=Education and theory : strangers in paradigms |year=2007 |publisher=Open Univ. Press |location=Maidenhead |isbn=9780335211791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to "[[praxis (process)|practice]]" (from Greek ''[[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]]'', πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ''doing'', which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}} A classical example of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: [[medical theory]] involves trying to understand the [[Causality|causes]] and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.{{efn|1= See for example [[Hippocrates]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory Praeceptiones, Part 1].  {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912175614/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory |date = September 12, 2014 }} }}

In modern [[science]], the term "theory" refers to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], a well-confirmed type of explanation of [[nature]], made in a way [[Consistency|consistent]] with [[scientific method]], and fulfilling the [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|criteria]] required by [[modern science]]. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for, or empirically contradict ("[[Falsifiability|falsify]]") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url = http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word ''[[hypothesis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medicine|first1=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of|title=Science, evolution, and creationism|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0309105862|page=11|edition=|url=http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable [[conjecture]]s, and from [[scientific laws]], which are descriptive accounts of how nature behaves under certain conditions.

== Ancient uses ==
The English word ''theory'' derives from a technical term in [[philosophy]] in [[Classical Greece|Ancient Greek]]. As an everyday word, ''[[theoria]]'', {{lang|grc|θεωρία}}, meant "a looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to [[contemplation|contemplative]] or [[speculative reason|speculative]] understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|natural things]], such as those of [[natural philosopher]]s, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.{{efn|1=The word ''theoria'' occurs in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], for example, that of [[Plato]]. It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for {{lang|grc|θεωρός}} "spectator", {{lang|grc|θέα}} ''thea'' "a view" + {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ''horan'' "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=qewr&amp;lang=greek dictionary entries at Perseus website].}} English-speakers have used the word ''theory'' since at least the late [[16th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|theory|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern uses of the word ''theory'' derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and [[reason|rational]] explanation of the general [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the [[Greek language]]. In the book ''From Religion to Philosophy'', [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] suggests that the [[Orphics]] used the word ''theoria'' to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From religion to philosophy: a study in the origins of western speculation |last=Cornford |first=Francis Macdonald |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=November 8, 1991 |isbn=978-0-691-02076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word ''theory'' the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bertrand Russell |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]] |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with ''praxis'' or practice, and this contrast remains today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as [[nature (philosophy)|nature]], so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, ''praxis'' involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of ''praxis'' or doing.{{efn|1= 
The [[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]] cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and involving the definition of [[natural science]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a 11.1064a17], "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b 6.1025b25], "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.}}

== Theories formally and scientifically ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}
Theories are [[analysis|analytical]] tools for [[understanding]], [[explanation|explaining]], and making [[prediction]]s about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. A formal theory is [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] in nature and is only meaningful when given a [[semantics|semantic]] component by applying it to some content (e.g., [[fact]]s and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in [[natural language]], but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the [[formal language]] of [[mathematical logic]]. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of [[reason|rational thought]] or [[logic]].

Theory is constructed of a set of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.&lt;ref name="curry"&gt;Curry, Haskell, ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same [[explanatory power]] because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or [[observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]], and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The [[metatheory|form of theories]] is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in [[model theory]]. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under application of certain procedures called [[rules of inference]]. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of [[axioms]] (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A [[theorem]] is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are [[abstraction]]s of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include [[arithmetic]] (abstracting concepts of number), [[geometry]] (concepts of space), and [[probability]] (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no consistent, [[recursively enumerable]] theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of [[natural numbers]] can be expressed, can include all [[truth|true]] statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===
{{Main|Underdetermination}}
A theory is ''underdetermined'' (also called ''indeterminacy of data to theory'') if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] issue about the relation of [[evidence]] to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a [[hypothesis]].

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===
{{Main|Intertheoretic reduction}}
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more [[explanatory power]]), we are [[Theory of justification|justified]] in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an ''intertheoretic reduction'' because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ''sound'', "light" and ''heat'' have been reduced to ''wave compressions and rarefactions'', ''electromagnetic waves'', and ''molecular kinetic energy'', respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called ''intertheoretic identities.'' When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an ''intertheoretic elimination.'' For instance, the [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of [[caloric fluid]] was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that [[phlogiston]] is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Theories vs. theorems===
Theories are distinct from [[theorem]]s. A ''theorem'' is [[formal proof|derived]] deductively from [[axiom]]s (basic assumptions) according to a [[formal system]] of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. ''Theories'' are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '[[rigor]]ously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

==Scientific theories==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been [[Reproducibility|repeatedly confirmed]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 National Academy of Sciences], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS Evolution Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources ([[consilience]]).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing [[technology]] or curing [[disease]].

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.  Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=11 National Academy of Sciences] (2008), ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the term ''theory'' would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even [[Scientific modelling|scientific models.]]

=== Philosophical views===
The [[logical positivist]]s thought of scientific theories as ''deductive theories''—that a theory's content is based on some [[formal system|formal system of logic]] and on basic [[axioms]]. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a [[logical consequence]] of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.&lt;ref name="curry"/&gt; This is called the [[received view of theories]].

In the [[semantic view of theories]],  which has largely replaced the received view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories are viewed as [[scientific models]]. A [[Scientific model|model]] is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [[Scientific theory#Theories as models|Theories as models]] for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In [[physics]] the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term ''theoretical'' ===
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term "theoretical." These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/21457-what-is-a-law-in-science-definition-of-scientific-law.html|title=What Is a Law in Science?|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=Live Science |first=Alina|last=Bradford|date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical theories ==
{{Main|Philosophical theory}}
A theory can be either ''descriptive'' as in science, or ''prescriptive'' ([[normative ethics|normative]]) as in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kneller|first1=George Frederick|title=Introduction to the philosophy of education|date=1964|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:UOM39015026974538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of [[idea]]s. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include [[set theory]] and [[number theory]]; however [[literary theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[music theory]] are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===
{{Main|Metatheory}}
One form of philosophical theory is a ''metatheory'' or ''meta-theory''. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s.

== Political theories ==
{{Main|Political theory}}
A political theory is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]].

== Jurisprudential theories ==
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
In social science, [[jurisprudence]] is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

'''Transient modelling''' is a way of looking at a process with the primary criterion of time, observing the pattern of changes in the subject being studied over time. The obverse of it is [[Steady state]], where you might know only the starting and ending figures but do not understand the process by which they were derived.

Transient models will reveal the pattern of a process, which might be [[sinusoidal]] or another shape that will help to design a better system to manage that process. Transient models can be done on a [[spreadsheet]] with an ability to generate charts, or by any software that can handle data of inputs and outputs and generate some sort of a display. Transient modelling does not need a computer.  It is a methodology that has worked for centuries, by observers noting patterns of change against time, analysing the result and proposing improved design solutions.

A simple example is a garden [[water tank]]. This is being topped up by rainfall from the roof, but when the tank is full, the remaining water goes to the drain. When the gardener draws water off, the level falls. If the garden is large and the summer is hot, a steady state will occur in summer where the tank is nearly always empty in summer. If the season is wet, the garden is getting water from the sky, and the tank is not being emptied sufficiently, so in steady state it will be observed to be always full. If the gardener has a way of observing the level of water in the tank, and a record of daily rainfall and temperatures, and is precisely metering the amount of water being drawn off every day, the numbers and the dates can be recorded in spreadsheet at daily intervals. After enough samples are taken, a chart can be developed to model the rise and fall pattern over a year, or over 2 years. With a better understanding of the process, it might emerge that a 200litre water tank would run out 20–25 days a year, but a 400-litre water tank would never run out, and a 300-litre tank would run out only 1-2 day a year and therefore that would be an acceptable risk and it would be the most economical solution.

One of the best examples of transient modelling is [[transient climate simulation]]. The analysis of [[ice core]]s in glaciers to understand [[climate change]]. Ice cores have thousands of layers, each of which represents a winter season of snowfall, and trapped in these are bubbles of air, particle of space dust and pollen which reveal climatic data of the time. By mapping these to a time scale, scientists can analyse the fluctuations over time and make predictions for the future.

Transient modelling is the basis of [[weather forecasting]], of managing [[ecosystem]]s, rail timetabling, managing the electricity grid, setting the national budget, [[floating currency]], understanding traffic flows on a [[freeway]], solar gains on glass fronted buildings, or even of checking the day-to-day transactions of one's monthly [[bank statement]].

With the transient modelling approach, you understand the whole process better when the inputs and outputs are graphed against time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9590">[[File:Flock of birds at Rome.ogg|right|300px|thumb|Although this flock is made of the same ''type'' of bird, each individual bird is a different ''token''. (50 MB video of a [[Flock (birds)|flock of birds]] in Rome)|thumbtime=6]]
The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''uncertainty principle''' (also known as '''Heisenberg's uncertainty principle''') is any of a variety of [[Inequality (mathematics)|mathematical inequalities]]&lt;ref name=Sen2014&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sen | first1 = D. | title = The Uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics | url = http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/107/02/0203.pdf | journal = Current Science | volume = 107| issue = 2| year = 2014| pages = 203–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a [[particle]], known as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] ''x'' and [[momentum]] ''p'', can be known.

Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist  [[Werner Heisenberg]], it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=3–4 |year=1927 |pages=172–198 |doi=10.1007/BF01397280 |postscript=. |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H }}.

Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Furuta|first=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|journal=Scientific American|year=2012|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ozawa|first=Masanao|title=Universally valid reformulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on noise and disturbance in measurement|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|year=2003|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.042105|arxiv = quant-ph/0207121 |bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67d2105O|issue=4 |pages=42105}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a somewhat similar effect in [[physics]], called the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Heisenberg, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all [[wave|wave-like systems]],&lt;ref name="Rozema"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rozema | first1 = L.

Thus, ''the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology''.&lt;ref name=nptel&gt;{{YouTube|TcmGYe39XG0|Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Professor V.

This fact is experimentally well-known for example in quantum optics (see e.g. chap. 2 and Fig. 2.1  {{Citation|last=Leonhardt|first=Ulf|title=Measuring the Quantum State of Light|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 49730 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it. Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program. These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in [[superconductivity|superconducting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Elion|first=W. J.|author2=M. Matters, U.

The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.

Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].

In [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|Ψ}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Laloë |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Schrödinger equation}}
According to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], every object in the universe is a [[wave]], i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon. The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\hbar} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname P [a \leq X \leq b] = \int_a^b |\psi(x)|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the single-moded plane wave, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. 

On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto \sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\hbar}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(p) \cdot e^{i p x/\hbar} \, dp ~, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&amp;nbsp;''σ''. Since &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.

The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Another way of stating this is that σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound. Click the ''show'' button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.

!Proof of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics
|-
|We are interested in the [[variance]]s of position and momentum, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp \right)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], we will assume that the [[expected value|means]] vanish, which just amounts to a shift of the origin of our coordinates. (A more general proof that does not make this assumption is given below.) This gives us the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp~.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x \cdot \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[function space]]. We can define an [[inner product]] for a pair of functions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') in this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u \mid v \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u^*(x) \cdot v(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk denotes the [[complex conjugate]].

With this inner product defined, we note that the variance for position can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle f \mid f \rangle ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We can repeat this for momentum by interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(p)=p \cdot \varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; as a vector, but we can also take advantage of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are Fourier transforms of each other. We evaluate the inverse Fourier transform through [[integration by parts]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot \varphi(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ p \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \cancel{ \left. \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \right|_{-\infty}^\infty } - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{-i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \, e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \left( -i \hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right) \cdot \psi(x) ,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the canceled term vanishes because the wave function vanishes at infinity. Often the term &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is called the momentum operator in position space. Applying [[Parseval's theorem]], we see that the variance for momentum can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\tilde{g}(p)|^2 \, dp = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle g \mid g \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \langle f \mid f \rangle \cdot \langle g \mid g \rangle \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus squared of any complex number ''z'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;|z|^{2} = \Big(\text{Re}(z)\Big)^{2}+\Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2} \geq \Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2}=\Big(\frac{z-z^{\ast}}{2i}\Big)^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g\mid f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 \geq \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g \mid f \rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to evaluate these inner products.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = {} &amp; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, x \cdot \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
&amp;{} - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \cdot x \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \frac{d(x \psi(x))}{dx} \right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \psi(x) + \left(x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right)\right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the above inequalities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 \ge \left(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i \hbar}{2 i}\right)^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
or taking the square root

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the only ''physics'' involved in this proof was that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are wave functions for position and momentum, which are Fourier transforms of each other. A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.

===Matrix mechanics interpretation===
(Ref &lt;ref name="L&amp;L"/&gt;) 
{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|Â}} and {{mvar|B̂}},  one defines their commutator as
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i \hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By definition, this means that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}|\psi\rangle = x_0 |\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; Applying the commutator to &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x}\hat{p}-\hat{p}\hat{x}) | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = i \hbar | \psi \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Î}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].

Suppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If this were true, then  one could write
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) p_0 \, | \psi \rangle = (x_0 \hat{I} - x_0 \hat{I})  p_0 \, | \psi \rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle=i \hbar | \psi \rangle \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.

When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x=\sqrt{\langle \hat{x}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{x}\rangle^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p=\sqrt{\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{p}\rangle^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.

==Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations==
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1929"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H. P.|title=The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Phys. Rev.|year=1929|volume=34|pages=163–64|bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an arbitrary [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{O}}&lt;/math&gt; we can associate a standard deviation

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}\rangle^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicate an [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]. For a pair of operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, we may define their ''[[commutator]]'' as

:::&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A},&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by

::: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A \sigma_B \geq \left| \frac{1}{2i}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| = \frac{1}{2}\left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately [[Logical consequence|follows from]] a slightly stronger inequality, the ''Schrödinger uncertainty relation'',&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930"&gt;{{Citation | last = Schrödinger |first = E. | title = Zum Heisenbergschen Unschärfeprinzip | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse | volume = 14 | pages = 296–303 | year = 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The derivation shown here incorporates and builds off of those shown in Robertson,&lt;ref name="Robertson1929" /&gt; Schrödinger&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930" /&gt; and standard textbooks such as Griffiths.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"&gt;{{Citation|last=Griffiths|first=David|title=Quantum Mechanics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, based upon the definition of [[variance]], we have

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

we let &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle=|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and thus

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for any other Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the same state

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_B^2 = \langle(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle = \langle g\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; |g\rangle=|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of the two deviations can thus be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

In order to relate the two vectors &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, we use the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]&lt;ref name="Riley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Riley | first = K. F. | author2 = M. P. Hobson and S. J. Bence | title = Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering | publisher = Cambridge | year = 2006 | pages = 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is defined as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid f\rangle\langle g\mid g\rangle \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;

and thus Eq. ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be written as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2\sigma_B^2 \geq |\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in general a complex number, we use the fact that the modulus squared of any complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;|z|^2=zz^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus squared can also be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 = \Big(\operatorname{Re}(z)\Big)^2+\Big(\operatorname{Im}(z)\Big)^2 = \Big(\frac{z+z^\ast}{2}\Big)^2 +\Big(\frac{z-z^\ast}{2i}\Big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g \mid f \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 = \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is written out explicitly as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; are Hermitian operators, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle f\mid g\rangle &amp; = \langle\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A}\rangle)(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid(\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle - \hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle + \langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\hat{B}\Psi\rangle-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle
-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle\Psi\rangle+\langle\Psi\mid\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:::&lt;math&gt;
\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle -2\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

We now substitute the above two equations above back into Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}) and get
:::&lt;math&gt;
|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2=\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^{2}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into Eq. ({{EquationNote|2}}) we get the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

:::&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_A\sigma_B \geq \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^2}.

===Examples===

Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations. A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; implies the Kennard inequality from above:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{J_i} \sigma_{J_j} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \big|\langle J_k\rangle\big|,&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes angular momentum along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;[J_x, J_y] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{xyz} J_z&lt;/math&gt;, a choice &lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = J_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{B} = J_y&lt;/math&gt;, in angular momentum multiplets, ''ψ'' = |''j'', ''m''〉, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, &lt;math&gt;\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) ≥ ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j'' ≥ ''m'', among others.
*{{anchor|Time–energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]]. Nevertheless, in 1945, [[Leonid Mandelshtam|L. I. Mandelshtam]] and [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] derived a non-relativistic '''''time–energy uncertainty relation''''', as follows.&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Mandelshtam, I. E.

:: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_E \frac{\sigma_B}{\left| \frac{\mathrm{d}\langle \hat B \rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}\right |} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
: where σ&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, σ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the standard deviation of ''B''. Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|ψ}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (Δ''t'') after which the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; changes appreciably.
: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.&lt;ref&gt;The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

===Energy–time uncertainty principle{{anchors|Energy–time uncertainty principle}}===
Other than the position–momentum uncertainty relation, the most important uncertainty relation is that between energy and time. The energy–time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson–Schrödinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E \Delta t \gtrsim h,&lt;/math&gt;

but it was not always obvious what &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked "To violate the time–energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!"&lt;ref name="C Jansson"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''false'' formulation of the energy–time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; requires a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; h/\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.

Another common misconception is that the energy–time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated—energy can be "borrowed" from the universe as long as it is "returned" within a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"/&gt;   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron–positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.

In 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time–energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of "events".&lt;ref&gt;see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

===A counterexample===
Suppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, which we may take to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Define "position" and "momentum" operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\psi(\theta)=\theta\psi(\theta),\quad \theta\in [0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{d\psi}{d\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on our choice to have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi-\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi=i\hbar\psi&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; are defined, and the space of such &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. See  {{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any of the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)=e^{2\pi in\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Note also that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A\sigma_B=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, since multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall2013"/&gt; Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be defined, does not apply. (These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the [[Canonical commutation relation#The Weyl relations|Weyl relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the usual position and momentum operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur. As long as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; fails to be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states===
{{Main article|Quantum harmonic oscillator|Stationary state}}
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p = i\sqrt{\frac{m \omega\hbar}{2}}(a^\dagger-a).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\dagger}|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; 
the [[variance]]s may be computed directly,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{m\omega} \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \hbar m\omega \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The product of these standard deviations is then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.~&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the above Kennard bound&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; is saturated for the [[ground state]] {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, for which the probability density is just the [[normal distribution]].

In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \Omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \Omega (x-x_0)^2}{2\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω. Through integration over the [[Propagator#Basic Examples: Propagator of Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator|propagator]], we can solve for the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent solution. After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(x,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( x_0 \cos{(\omega t)} , \frac{\hbar}{2 m \Omega} \left( \cos^2(\omega t) + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi(p,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( -m x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t), \frac{\hbar m \Omega}{2} \left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Copying the variances above and applying [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]], we can write the product of the standard deviations as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_x \sigma_p&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right) \cos{(4 \omega t)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \ge 2, \quad |\cos(4 \omega t)| \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω'') .
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right)} = \frac{\hbar}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Coherent states===
{{Main article|Coherent state}}
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the [[annihilation operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
which may be represented in terms of [[Fock state]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle =e^{-{|\alpha|^2\over2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\alpha^n \over \sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO, the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

with position and momentum each contributing an amount &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar/2}&lt;/math&gt; in a "balanced" way. Moreover, every [[squeezed coherent state]] also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general.

===Particle in a box===
{{Main article|Particle in a box}}
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Particle in a box#Wavefunctions|eigenfunctions in position and momentum space]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,t) =
\begin{cases}
A \sin(k_n x)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_n t}, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; L,\\
0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(p,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi L}{\hbar}}\,\,\frac{n\left(1-(-1)^ne^{-ikL} \right) e^{-i \omega_n t}}{\pi ^2 n^2-k^2 L^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\frac{\pi^2 \hbar n^2}{8 L^2 m}&lt;/math&gt; and we have used the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. The variances of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2=\frac{L^2}{12}\left(1-\frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2=\left(\frac{\hbar n\pi}{L}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The product of the standard deviations is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n=1, \, 2, \, 3,\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 1, so the uncertainty principle is never violated. For numerical concreteness, the smallest value occurs when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3}-2} \approx 0.568 \hbar &gt; \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant momentum===
{{Main article|Wave packet}}
[[File:Guassian Dispersion.gif|360 px|thumb|right|Position space probability density of an initially Gaussian state moving at minimally uncertain, constant momentum in free space]]
Assume a particle initially has a [[momentum space]] wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where we have introduced a reference scale &lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; describing the width of the distribution−−cf. [[nondimensionalization]]. If the state is allowed to evolve in free space, then the time-dependent momentum and position space wave functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}-\frac{ip^2 t}{2m\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{-x_0^2 p_0^2 /2\hbar^2}}{\sqrt{1+i\omega_0 t}} \cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{(x-ix_0^2 p_0/\hbar)^2}{2x_0^2 (1+i\omega_0 t)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle p(t) \rangle = p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p(t) = \hbar / x_0 \sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the position is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \frac{x_0}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(t) \sigma_p(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe [[density matrix|mixed states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiger|first=Nathan|title=Quantum Uncertainty and Conservation Law Restrictions on Gate Fidelity|url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/Thesis/view.aspx?id=270|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho\{A,B\}) - \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)\operatorname{tr}(\rho B)\right)^2 +\left(\frac{1}{2i} \operatorname{tr}(\rho[A,B])\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation can be trivial if the state of the system is chosen to be eigenstate of one of the observable. The stronger uncertainty relations proved by Maccone and Pati give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccone|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Pati|first2=Arun K.|title=Stronger Uncertainty Relations for All Incompatible Observables|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=31 December 2014|volume=113|issue=26|page=260401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.260401|arxiv=1407.0338|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113z0401M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 + \sigma_{ B}^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi\mid [A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + \mid \langle \Psi\mid(A \pm i B)\mid{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid A \mid \Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{B}^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid B \mid\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and  one should choose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi\mid[A, B]\mid\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; to make this real quantity a positive number.

The second stronger uncertainty  relation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \mid(A + B)\mid \Psi \rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a state orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.  One may note that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;( A+ B)&lt;/math&gt; without being an eigenstate of either
&lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. However,  when &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of one of the two observables the Heisenberg–Schrödinger uncertainty relation becomes trivial. But the lower bound in the new relation is nonzero 
unless &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of both.

===Phase space===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star-square function. Given a [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] &lt;math&gt;W(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moyal product|star product]] ★ and a function ''f'', the following is generally true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. |last2= Zachos | first2= C. | title = Negative Probability and Uncertainty Relations| journal = Modern Physics Letters A  | volume = 16 | issue = 37 | pages = 2381–2385 | doi = 10.1142/S021773230100576X | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0105226 |bibcode = 2001MPLA...16.2381C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\int (f^* \star f) \, W(x,p) \, dx \, dp \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;f=a+bx+cp&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\begin{bmatrix}a^* &amp; b^* &amp; c^* \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this positivity condition is true for ''all'' ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive. The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix} = \det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x^2 \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp - \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle &amp; \langle p^2 \rangle \end{bmatrix} \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, explicitly, after algebraic manipulation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \left( \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \right)\left( \langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2 \right)\ge \left( \langle xp \rangle - \langle x \rangle \langle p \rangle \right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic and statistical errors===

The inequalities above focus on the ''statistical imprecision'' of observables as quantified by the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the ''systematic error'', a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].

If we let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_A&lt;/math&gt; represent the error (i.e., [[accuracy|inaccuracy]]) of a measurement of an observable ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt; the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable ''B'' by the former measurement of ''A'', then the inequality proposed by Ozawa&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"/&gt; — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A\, \eta_B + \varepsilon_A \, \sigma_B + \sigma_A \, \eta_B \,\ge\,  \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the ''systematic error''.   Using the notation above to describe the ''error/disturbance'' effect of ''sequential measurements'' (first ''A'', then ''B''), it could be written as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{A} \, \eta_{B} \, \ge \,   \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

The formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive. It was ''not'' proposed by Heisenberg, but formulated in a mathematically consistent way only in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.160405| title = Proof of Heisenberg's Error-Disturbance Relation| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 111| issue = 16| year = 2013| last1 = Busch | first1 = P. | last2 = Lahti | first2 = P. | last3 = Werner | first3 = R.

Also, it must be stressed that the Heisenberg formulation is not taking into account the intrinsic statistical errors &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_B&lt;/math&gt;.  There is increasing experimental evidence&lt;ref name="Rozema"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Erhart | first1 = J.| last2 = Sponar | first2 =S.| last3 = Sulyok | first3 = G. | last4 = Badurek | first4 = G. | last5 = Ozawa | first5 = M. | last6 =  Hasegawa | first6 = Y.| title = Experimental demonstration of a universally valid error-disturbance uncertainty relation in spin measurements | journal = Nature Physics | volume=8 | pages=185–189 | year=2012 | doi=10.1038/nphys2194 | arxiv = 1201.1833 | bibcode = 2012NatPh...8..185E | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Baek | first1 =  S.-Y. | last2 = Kaneda  | first2 = F. | last3 = Ozawa | first3 = M. | last4 = Edamatsu | first4 = K. | title =  Experimental violation and reformulation of the Heisenberg's error-disturbance uncertainty relation |journal = Scientific Reports |volume= 3 |pages= 2221 |year= 2013 |doi= 10.1038/srep02221 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02221 |bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E2221B | pmid=23860715 | pmc=3713528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Ringbauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Biggerstaff | first2 = D.N. | last3 = Broome | first3 = M.A. | last4 =  Fedrizzi  | first4 = A.  | last5 =   Branciard | first5 = C. | last6 = White | first6 = A.G. | title = Experimental Joint Quantum Measurements with Minimum Uncertainty |journal =  Physical Review Letters |volume= 112 |pages= 020401 |year= 2014 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.020401 | url = http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.020401 |arxiv = 1308.5688 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112b0401R | pmid=24483993}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the total quantum uncertainty cannot be described by the Heisenberg term alone, but requires the presence of all the three terms of the Ozawa inequality. 
 
Using the same formalism,&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; it is also possible to introduce the other kind of physical situation, often confused with the previous one, namely the case of ''simultaneous measurements'' (''A'' and ''B'' at the same time):
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A \, \varepsilon_B  \, \ge  \, \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to derive an uncertainty relation that, as the Ozawa's one, combines both the statistical and systematic error components, but keeps a form very close to the Heisenberg original inequality.  By adding Robertson&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; 
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::

The four terms can be written as: 
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon_A + \sigma_A) \, (\eta_B + \sigma_B) \, \geq \,  \left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quantum entropic uncertainty principle ===

For many distributions, the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period.&lt;ref name="CarruthersNieto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=D. |last=Judge |title=On the uncertainty relation for angle variables|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento|year=1964|volume=31|issue=2|pages=332–340|doi=10.1007/BF02733639|bibcode=1964NCim...31..332J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1= M. |last1= Bouten |first2= N. |last2= Maene

A solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on [[entropic uncertainty]] instead of the product of variances. While formulating the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in 1957, [[Hugh Everett III]] conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=DeWitt |first=B.

:&lt;math&gt;H_a = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(a) \log(f(a))\,da,&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;H_b = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(b) \log(g(b))\,db&lt;/math&gt;

are subject to the following constraint,

where the logarithms may be in any base.

The probability distribution functions associated with the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wave function {{math|''&amp;phi;(x)''}} have dimensions of inverse length and momentum respectively, but the entropies may be rendered dimensionless by

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (x_0\,|\psi(x)|^2 ) \,dx =-\left\langle \ln (x_0\mid\psi(x)|^2 ) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are some arbitrarily chosen length and momentum respectively, which render the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless. Note that the entropies will be functions of these chosen parameters. Due to the [[Wavefunction#Relation between wave functions|Fourier transform relation]] between the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wavefunction {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''p'')}}, the above constraint can be written for the corresponding entropies as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]].

Depending on one's choice of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} product, the expression may be written in many ways. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is chosen to be {{mvar|h}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead,  {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be {{mvar|ħ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log (e\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are chosen to be unity in whatever system of units are being used, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h }{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|h}} is interpreted as a dimensionless number equal to the value of Planck's constant in the chosen system of units.

The quantum entropic uncertainty principle is more restrictive than the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D. |last=Chafaï |title=Gaussian maximum of entropy and reversed log-Sobolev inequality|arxiv=math/0102227 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36107-7_5 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-00072-3 |pages=194–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_x^2 / x_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_p \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_p^2 /p_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
(equivalently, from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance), it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is ''stronger than the one based on standard deviations'', because

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \exp\left(H_x + H_p - \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a consequence of the quantum entropic uncertainty principle, but not vice versa.  A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).

|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations. The length scale can be set to whatever is convenient, so we assign

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\psi(x) &amp;= \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)} \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi x_0^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{4x_0^2}\right)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution is the normal distribution
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

with Shannon entropy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (|\psi(x)|^2 \cdot x_0 ) \,dx \\

&amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A completely analogous calculation proceeds for the momentum distribution. Choosing a standard momentum of &lt;math&gt;p_0=\hbar/x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_p &amp;= - \int |\varphi(p)|^2 \ln (|\varphi(p)|^2 \cdot \hbar / x_0 ) \,dp \\
&amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)} \ln \left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}\right] \, dp \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -2v^2\right)} \left[\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + 2v^2 \right] \, dv \\
&amp;= \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is therefore the limiting value

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x+H_p &amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2} + \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= 1 + \ln \pi = \ln(e\pi).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let ''δx'' be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset ''c''. The probability of lying within the jth interval of width ''δx'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j]= \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x-c}^{(j+1/2)\delta x-c}| \psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To account for this discretization, we can define the Shannon entropy of the wave function for a given measurement apparatus as

: &lt;math&gt;H_x=-\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the above definition, the entropic uncertainty relation is

:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p&gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\delta x \delta p}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we note that {{math|''δx''&amp;nbsp;''δp''/''h''}} is a typical infinitesimal phase space volume used in the calculation of a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. The inequality is also strict and not saturated. Efforts to improve this bound are an active area of research.

!Normal distribution example

|We demonstrate this method first on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of lying within one of these bins can be expressed in terms of the [[error function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[x_j] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x}^{(j+1/2)\delta x} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{\hbar}\right) \, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}}^{(j+1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}} e^{u^2} \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum probabilities are completely analogous.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right)- \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we will set the resolutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x = \sqrt{\frac{h}{m \omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p = \sqrt{h m \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the probabilities reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j] = \operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x = H_p &amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] \\
&amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right] \ln \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]
&amp;\approx 0.3226\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.3226 + 0.3226 = 0.6452 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.3069&lt;/math&gt;

Note that despite being in the optimal case, the inequality is not saturated.

!Sinc function example
|-
|An example of a unimodal distribution with infinite variance is the [[sinc function]]. If the wave function is the correctly normalized uniform distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2a}} &amp; \text{for } |x| \le a, \\[8pt]
0 &amp; \text{for } |x|&gt;a
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
then its Fourier transform is the sinc function,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which yields infinite momentum variance despite having a centralized shape. The entropic uncertainty, on the other hand, is finite. Suppose for simplicity that the spatial resolution is just a two-bin measurement, ''δx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'', and that the momentum resolution is ''δp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''a''.

Partitioning the uniform spatial distribution into two equal bins is straightforward. We set the offset ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 so that the two bins span the distribution.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_0] = \int_{-a}^0 \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_1] = \int_0^a \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = -\sum_{j=0}^{1} \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} = \ln 2&lt;/math&gt;

The bins for momentum must cover the entire real line. As done with the spatial distribution, we could apply an offset. It turns out, however, that the Shannon entropy is minimized when the zeroth bin for momentum is centered at the origin. (The reader is encouraged to try adding an offset.) The probability of lying within an arbitrary momentum bin can be expressed in terms of the [[sine integral]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[p_j] &amp;= \frac{a}{\pi \hbar} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta p}^{(j+1/2)\delta p} \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right) \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2\pi (j-1/2)}^{2\pi (j+1/2)} \operatorname{sinc}^2(u) \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \operatorname {Si} ((4j+2)\pi)- \operatorname {Si} ((4j-2)\pi) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] = -\operatorname P[p_0] \ln \operatorname P[p_0]-2 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] \approx 0.53&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.69 + 0.53 = 1.22 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.31&lt;/math&gt;

==Harmonic analysis==
{{main article|Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle}}
In the context of [[harmonic analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its [[Fourier transform]]. To wit, the following inequality holds,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{\|f\|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities, including the above [[entropic uncertainty]], hold between a function {{mvar|f}} and its Fourier transform {{math| ƒ̂}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=V.|last1=Havin|first2= B.|last2=Jöricke|title=The Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Signal processing {{anchor|Gabor limit}}===
In the context of [[signal processing]], and in particular [[time–frequency analysis]], uncertainty principles are referred to as the '''Gabor limit''', after [[Dennis Gabor]], or sometimes the ''Heisenberg–Gabor limit''. The basic result, which follows from "Benedicks's theorem", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)—see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]]. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t \cdot \sigma_f \ge \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08 \text{ cycles}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; are the standard deviations of the time and frequency estimates respectively &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hall, [https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html "What is the Gabor uncertainty principle?"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Stated alternatively, "One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal (function {{mvar|f}} ) in both the [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] ({{math| ƒ̂}}, its Fourier transform)".

When applied to filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time; a concrete example are the [[Short-time Fourier transform#Resolution issues|resolution issues of the short-time Fourier transform]]—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.

Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results, and, in time–frequency analysis, rather than interpreting the (1-dimensional) time and frequency domains separately, one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the (2-dimensional) time–frequency plane. In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.

===DFT-Uncertainty principle===
There is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; its [[discrete Fourier transform]].

===Hardy's uncertainty principle===

Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} in &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\leq C(1+|x|)^Ne^{-a\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{f}(\xi)|\leq C(1+|\xi|)^Ne^{-b\pi \xi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C&gt;0,N&lt;/math&gt; an integer),

then, if {{math|1=''ab'' &gt; 1, ''f'' = 0}}, while if {{math|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then there is a polynomial {{mvar|P}} of degree {{math| ≤ ''N''}} such that

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-a\pi x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This was later improved as follows: if &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt; is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|f(x)||\hat{f}(\xi)|\frac{e^{\pi|\langle x,\xi\rangle|}}{(1+|x|+|\xi|)^N} \, dx \, d\xi &lt; +\infty ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-\pi\langle Ax,x\rangle} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is a polynomial of degree {{math|(''N'' − ''d'')/2}} and {{mvar|A}} is a real {{math|''d''×''d''}} positive definite matrix.

This result was stated in Beurling's complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=L.|last=Hörmander|authorlink=Lars Hörmander|title=A uniqueness theorem of Beurling for Fourier transform pairs|journal= Ark.

==History==
[[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the uncertainty principle at [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute in Copenhagen, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08.htm American Physical Society online exhibit on the Uncertainty Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr]]
In 1925, following pioneering work with [[Hendrik Kramers]], Heisenberg developed [[matrix mechanics]], which replaced the ad hoc [[old quantum theory]] with modern quantum mechanics. The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.

Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.

In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately ''both'' the position and the direction and speed of a particle ''at the same instant''.&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, W., ''Die Physik der Atomkerne'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1952, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement,&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt; but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. In his Chicago lecture&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |year=1930 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie  |language=de|location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel }} English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; he refined his principle:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p\gtrsim h&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

[[Earle Hesse Kennard|Kennard]]&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2{{pi}}}}}}, and {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum. Heisenberg only proved relation ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the special case of Gaussian states.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

===Terminology and translation===
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"),&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927" /&gt;
to describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty"). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Cassidy |year=2009 |title=Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb |location= New York |publisher=Bellevue Literary Press |page=185 |isbn= |bibcode=2010PhT....63a..49C |last2=Saperstein |first2=Alvin M. |volume=63 |journal=Physics Today |doi=10.1063/1.3293416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisenberg's microscope===
[[File:Heisenberg gamma ray microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|Heisenberg's gamma-ray microscope for locating an electron (shown in blue). The incoming gamma ray (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's aperture angle ''θ''. The scattered gamma-ray is shown in red. Classical [[optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δ''x'' that depends on ''θ'' and the wavelength ''λ'' of the incoming light.]]
{{Main article|Heisenberg's microscope}}

The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.&lt;ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}}
:Problem 1 – If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long [[wavelength]] and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.

:Problem 2 – If a large [[aperture]] is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see [[Rayleigh criterion]]); but by the principle of [[conservation of momentum]], the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.

The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W.

Freeman and Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-57259-164-1 |chapter=5–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.

==Critical reactions==
{{Main article|Bohr–Einstein debates}}

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying [[determinism]] and [[Scientific realism|realism]]. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.

===The ideal of the detached observer===
[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle "the ideal of the detached observer" (phrase translated from the German):
{{blockquote|"Like the moon has a definite position" Einstein said to me last winter, "whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made." I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.
*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===Einstein's slit===
The first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:

:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.

Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|Δ''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|Δ''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.

A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's box===
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]]."&lt;ref name="Gamow"&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. "We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,"&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPR paradox for entangled particles===
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=452 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.

While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Popper's criticism ===
{{main article|Popper's experiment}}
[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co. | year = 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvie2006"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment, | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.

In 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',&lt;ref name="Popper1934"&gt;{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''. [original emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', Unwin Hyman Ltd, 1982, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper proposed an experiment to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the [[EPR paradox|EPR experiment]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehra2001"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehra | first1 = Jagdish | last2 = Rechenberg | first2 = Helmut | title = The Historical Development of Quantum Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-387-95086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many-worlds uncertainty ===
{{main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] originally outlined by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's [[wave function collapse]] with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose ''distribution'' is governed by [[wave function]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.

=== Free will ===

Some scientists including [[Arthur Compton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1911.172| title = The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will| journal = Science| volume = 74| issue = 1911| pages = 172| year = 1931| last1 = Compton | first1 = A. H. | pmid=17808216|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459164a| title = Is free will an illusion?| journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 164–165| year = 2009| last1 = Heisenberg | first1 = M. |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..164H }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, [[Quantum biology|nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics]] are unlikely, due to the rapid [[decoherence]] time of quantum systems at room temperature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.07.001| pmid = 15555759| title = Does quantum mechanics play a non-trivial role in life?| journal = Biosystems| volume = 78| issue = 1–3| pages = 69–79| year = 2004| last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is  overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics==

There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hanggi, S. Wehner, A violation of the uncertainty principle also implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics; 2012, arXiv:1205.6894v1 (quant-phy).&lt;/ref&gt;
