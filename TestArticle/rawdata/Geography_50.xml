[[Image:DiagramApparentWind.png|thumb|325px|V = boat speed, H = head wind, W = true wind, A = apparent wind, α = pointing angle, β = angle of apparent wind]]

'''Apparent wind''' is the wind experienced by a moving object.

==Definition of apparent wind==
The ''apparent wind'' is the wind experienced by an observer in motion and is the [[relative velocity]] of the wind in relation to the observer.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

The ''[[velocity]] of the apparent wind'' is the [[vector sum]] of the ''velocity of the headwind'' (which is the velocity a moving object would experience in still air) plus the ''velocity of the true wind''.  The headwind is the [[additive inverse]] of the object's velocity; therefore, the ''velocity of the apparent wind'' can also be defined as a vector sum of the ''velocity of the true wind'' minus the ''velocity of the object''.{{CN|date=September 2016}}

==Apparent wind in sailing==
In [[sailing]], ''apparent wind'' is the speed and direction of wind indicated by a wind instrument ([[anemometer]]) on a ''moving'' craft (on water, land or ice) in undisturbed air. It is composed of the ''combined'' speeds and directions of the craft and wind observed by a ''stationary'' wind instrument—the ''true wind''. A true wind coming from the bow increases the apparent wind induced by the speed of the craft, coming from the stern it decreases apparent wind, and coming from the side the apparent wind angle and speed change according to the combined speed and direction of each the craft and the true wind. Apparent wind is important to sailors in order to set sail angle with respect to the wind and to anticipate how much power the wind will generate on a [[point of sail]]. Apparent wind differs in speed and direction from the '''true wind''' that is experienced by a stationary observer and composed of the true wind speed (TWS) and true wind direction (TWD) or the TWS and true wind angle (TWA) relative to the boat if it were stationary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are My Electronics Telling Me About Boatspeed and Heading?|url=https://www.sailingworld.com/what-are-my-electronics-telling-me-about-boatspeed-and-heading|website=Sailing World|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[nautical terminology]], apparent wind is measured in [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.

Note that a number of additional factors come into play when converting the measurements from the masthead anemometer into the true wind if a high degree of accuracy is required, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornton|first1=Tim|title=The Offshore Yacht|publisher=Adlard Coles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchaj|first1=C.A.|title=The AeroHydrodynamics of Sailing|publisher=Adlard Coles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sailing Instruments Calibration|url=http://www.ockam.com/category/sailing-instruments-calibration/|website=Ockam Instruments|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leeway]] (or drift on power vessels) - it is very seldom that a craft is pointing in the direction it is going, and on a sailboat the angle of leeway is the difference between the heading of the craft and its actual track through the water. This must be corrected for when converting apparent wind angle to true wind direction. The same effect is found when the craft is altering course.
* Mast twist - the rigging loads often put a significant amount of torsion on the mast, especially if the rig has runners, so it is twisted along its length
* Mast rotation - many racing [[multihull]]s have a mast that can be rotated, so the anemometer reading needs to be corrected by the angle of rotation of the mast
* Heel angle - this is a simple trigonometric correction
* Upwash from the sails - the airflow around the top of the mast is distorted by the presence of the sails. This effect varies with the sails set at the time, the wind speed and the point of sail, but is noticed by the true wind angle changing from port to starboard tack, and the true wind speed changing from when beating to running
* Boat motions - as the masthead is so distant from the centre of motion of the craft, inertial effect on both the wind vane and the anemometer cups can be significant when the craft is moving, especially when pitching and rolling
* Wind shear - there can be a significant change in both wind speed and direction between the water's surface and the top of the mast, especially in conditions of unstable, light airs. The wind instruments are just measuring conditions at the masthead, and these are not necessarily the same at all heights

In the presence of a current, the true wind is considered to be that measured on the craft drifting with the water over the bottom, and wind with respect to the sea bed as the ''ground'' or ''geographical wind''.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Instruments==
The '''apparent wind''' on board (a boat) is often quoted as a speed measured by a [[Mast (sailing)|masthead]] [[transducer]] containing an [[anemometer]] and [[Weather vane|wind vane]] that measures wind speed in [[Knot (unit)|knots]] and wind direction in degrees relative to the [[Course (navigation)|heading]] of the boat. Modern instrumentation can calculate the true wind velocity when the apparent wind and boat speed and direction are input.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Implications on sailing speeds==
In [[sailboat racing]], and especially in [[speed sailing]], apparent wind is a vital factor, when determining the [[points of sail]] a sailboat can effectively travel in. 
A vessel traveling at increasing speed relative to the ''prevailing wind'' will encounter the wind driving the sail at a decreasing angle and increasing velocity. Eventually, the increased drag and diminished degree of efficiency of a sail at extremely low [[Angle of attack|angles]] will cause a loss of accelerating force. This constitutes the main limitation to the speed of wind-driven vessels and vehicles.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

[[windsurfing|Windsurfers]] and certain types of boats are able to sail faster than the true wind. These include fast [[multihull]]s and some [[Planing (sailing)|planing]] monohulls.  [[ice yachting|Ice-sailors]] and [[land sailing|land-sailors]] also usually fall into this category, because of their relatively low amount of [[drag (physics)|drag]] or [[friction]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

In the foiling AC72 America's cup catamarans, the boats sail through the water at up to double the environmental wind strength. The effect of this is to radically change the apparent wind direction when sailing "downwind". In these boats the forward speed is so great that the apparent wind is always forward—at an angle that varies between 2 and 4 degrees to the wing sail. This means that AC72's  are effectively tacking downwind, although at a greater angle than the normal 45-degree upwind angle, usually between 50 and 70 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;TVNZ Live America's cup Broadcast. Interview with Tom Schnackenburg. 22/9/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas of relevance==
In [[fixed-wing aircraft]], apparent wind is what is experienced on board, and it determines the necessary speeds for take-off and landing.  [[Aircraft carrier]]s generally steam directly upwind at maximum speed, in order to increase apparent wind and reduce the necessary take-off velocity.  Land-based [[airport]] traffic, as well as most mid-sized and large birds generally take off and land facing upwind for the same reason.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Calculating apparent velocity and angle==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2016}}
&lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{W^2 + V^2 + 2WV\cos{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; = velocity (boat speed over ground, always =&gt; 0)
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = true wind velocity (always =&gt; 0)
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = true pointing angle in degrees (0 = upwind, 180 = downwind)
* &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = apparent wind velocity  (always =&gt; 0)
The above formula is derived from the [[Law of cosines]] and using &lt;math&gt;\cos(\alpha') = \cos(180^\circ-\alpha) = -\cos(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

The angle of apparent wind (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated from the measured velocity of the boat and wind using the inverse cosine in degrees (&lt;math&gt;\arccos&lt;/math&gt;)

&lt;math&gt; \beta = \arccos \left( \frac{W\cos \alpha+V}{A} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{W\cos \alpha+V}{\sqrt{W^2 + V^2 +2WV\cos{\alpha}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

If the velocity of the boat and the velocity and the angle of the apparent wind are known, for instance from a [[Apparent wind#Instruments|measurement]], the true wind velocity and direction can be calculated with:

&lt;math&gt;W = \sqrt{A^2 + V^2 - 2AV\cos{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{W} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{\sqrt{A^2 + V^2 -2AV\cos{\beta}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

''Note:'' Due to quadrant ambiguity, this equation for &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is only valid when the apparent winds are coming from the [[starboard]] direction (0° &lt; ''β'' &lt; 180°).  For [[port]] apparent winds (180° &lt; ''β'' &lt; 360° or 0° &gt; ''β'' &gt; -180°), the true pointing angle (''α'') has the opposite sign:

&lt;math&gt; \alpha = -\arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{W} \right) = -\arccos \left( \frac{A\cos \beta-V}{\sqrt{A^2 + V^2 -2AV\cos{\beta}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

An '''arpent''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁpɑ̃}}) is a unit of [[length]] and a unit of [[area]]. It is a pre-[[Metric system|metric]] [[French units of measurement|French unit]] based on the Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Length|''actus'']]. It is used in [[Quebec]], some areas of the [[United States customary units|United States]] that were part of [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], and in [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]].

==Etymology==

The word ''arpent'' is believed to derive from the [[Late Latin]] ''arepennis'' (equal to half a ''[[jugerum]]''), which in turn comes from the [[Gaulish]] *''are-penno''- ("end, extremity of a field").

==Unit of length==

There were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution#Length|French feet]] (''{{lang|fr|pied}}'', of approximately {{convert|32.48|cm|in|disp=or}}), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet.

* In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 [[English foot|English feet]] = about 58.47 [[metre]]s
* In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres

==Unit of area==

Historically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent (''{{lang|fr|arpent carré}}''), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 [[square metre]]s = about 0.845 English [[acre]]s.  Certain U.S. states have official definitions of the arpent which vary slightly:
* In [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.84628|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;In Louisiana, an arpent is equal to approximately 0.84628 acre; see ''Derouen v. Poirier'', 136 So. 2d 131, footnote 1 (La. 3d Cir. Ct. App. 1961) (''dicta'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], the official conversion is 1 arpent = {{convert|0.8507|acre|m2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Glossary of Geology|editor1=Julia A. Jackson |editor2=James P. Mehl |editor3=Klaus K. E. Neuendorf |publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9780922152766|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfnSesBc-RgC&amp;pg=PA37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the square arpent was 220 French feet × 220 French feet = 48,400 French square feet, about {{convert|5107|m2|acre|disp=or}}.

In Mauritius and Seychelles, an arpent is about 4220.87 [[square metre]]s, 0.4221 hectares, 1.043 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mauritius: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|publisher=International Monetary Fund|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wqUP-8z25CoC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=mauritius+arpent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q5ME0mHg9h&amp;sig=Q6Npl1Drm-w208E2RC_Y6jm6d_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9uIKjvYPWAhUHz2MKHcw9ApYQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=mauritius%20arpent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louisiana==
In Louisiana, parcels of land known as ''arpent'' sections or French ''arpent'' land grants also pre-date the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), but are treated as PLSS sections. An ''arpent'' is a French measurement of approximately {{convert|192|ft|m}}, and a square arpent (also referred to as an ''arpent'') is about {{convert|0.84|acre|m2}}.

French arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called [[ribbon farm|ribbon farms]], usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep.

This method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.&lt;ref name="natlatlas"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html The Public Land Survey System (PLSS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511182116/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_plss.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Border irregularities of the United States''', particularly [[panhandles]] and highway incursions into other jurisdictions, are shown here. Often they are a result of borders which do not conform to geological features.

== International ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Canada–United States border#Boundary divisions}}There are several exclaves between the United States and Canada, including the entire state of [[Alaska]] (though the state can still be accessed by sea from the United States). Other exclaves include [[Akwesasne]], the [[Northwest Angle]], and [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]. 

The status of the waters around [[Dixon Entrance|Nunez Rocks]] is disputed. Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation ("bare at half-tide"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NSDE/|author=U.S. National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) area (LTE) that is south of a line known as the "A-B" Line,&lt;ref name="IBRU"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-3_gray.pdf |title=Canada's Unresolved Maritime Boundaries|page=61|last=Gray|first=David H.| work= IBRU Boundary and Security Bulletin|year=Autumn 1997|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined in a 1903 arbitration decision on the [[Alaska boundary dispute|Alaska–Canada boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/coordinates/PortlandCanal.htm |title= International Boundary Commission definition of the Canada/US boundary in the NAD83 CSRS reference frame |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court specified the initial boundary point (Point "A") at the northern end of Dixon Entrance&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundary Disputes and Treaties|first=James|last=White|publisher=Glasgow, Brook &amp; Company|location=Toronto|year=1914|pages=936–958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Point "B" {{convert|72|nmi|mi km}} to the east.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Alaska Boundary|last=Davidson|first=George|publisher=Alaska Packers Association|location=San Francisco|year=1903|pages=79–81, 129–134, 177–179, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada relies on the "A-B" Line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as Canadian internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the "A-B" Line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance,&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; with Canada's land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial sea throughout Dixon Entrance.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; This territory, which surrounds Nunez Rocks, extends south of the "A-B" line for the most part.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; The United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea Treaty]], although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Another disputed area is the Grey Zone, including [[Machias Seal Island]], in the Gulf of Maine.

The [[Aroostook Valley Country Club]] is a [[golf course]] which straddles the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], between the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]]. The club, located near [[Perth-Andover]], New Brunswick and [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], has its course (except part of the tee area for the ninth hole, and possibly part of a sand trap on the first hole) and clubhouse on the Canadian side of the border and its parking lot and pro shop on the American side.&lt;ref name="clui"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-0 |title=Chapter 1: Eastern Maine |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]], shifts in the course of the lower Rio Grande have created numerous [[wikt:pene-exclave|pene-exclave]]s. Under the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] and earlier treaties, the United States and Mexico have maintained the actual course of the river as the international boundary, but both must approve proposed changes. From 1989 to 2009, there were 128 locations where the river changed course, causing land that had been on one side of the river to then occupy the opposite bank. Until the boundary is officially changed, there are 60 small pene-exclaves of the state of [[Texas]] now lying on the southern side of the river, as well as 68 such pene-exclaves of Mexico on the northern side of the river.

=== Russia ===
The legal status of the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement|US-Russian border]] is unclear. The United States Senate ratified a treaty setting the boundary with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. However, shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the [[Russian parliament]] never voted on the treaty.

=== Cuba ===
The boundary between the United States and Cuba is a maritime boundary along the [[Straits of Florida]]. Despite tense relations between the countries, the United States operates a military base in Cuba, [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The land on which this military base sits is not sovereign United States territory; rather, it is leased from the Cuban Government.

==States==

=== Separated by the water ===

*[[Rosecrans Memorial Airport]], though lying within the city limits of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], is inaccessible by land from Missouri due to a change in the course of the [[Missouri River]] following the [[Great Flood of 1951]]. It is accessible only by crossing the river, then turning north through [[Elwood, Kansas]].
*[[Delaware]] has two [[exclaves]] of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of [[Delaware Bay]] northwest of [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott State Park]] and [[Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge]]: [[Finns Point]] and [[Artificial Island, Delaware]] near the [[Salem Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. At that point, the border runs along New Jersey's mean [[Low-tide elevation|low-tide mark]]. Thus when the spoils from the navigational [[dredging]] of the bay were dumped alongside Fort Mott and the Salem plant excavations nearby, both sites became part of [[New Castle County, Delaware]].
*Iowa's city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa|Carter Lake]] on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.
*Several small areas of western Kentucky lie north of the [[Ohio River]] on what is otherwise the Indiana side, including one area south of [[Evansville, Indiana]] that accommodates [[Ellis Park Race Course|a horse racing track]].
*Several portions of Nebraska lie east of the [[Missouri River]], mainly due to flooding and changes in the river's path:
**[[DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge]] near Blair, which borders Iowa. A portion of Iowa is also on the Nebraska side in the same area.
**[[McKissick Island]] near Peru, which borders Missouri.
**A section of land that borders Iowa, [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]].
**Onawa Materials Yard Wildlife Area and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Management Area near [[Onawa, Iowa]].
*[[Newport County, Rhode Island]] is separated from the rest of the state by the delta of the [[Taunton River]]. The only land connection is through [[Massachusetts]]
*The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is separated by the Chesapeake Bay from the rest of the Commonwealth.
*Divided coastal islands:
** Rhode Island and Connecticut share [[Sandy Point Island]] in [[Little Narragansett Bay]].
** New Jersey and New York share [[Shooter's Island]], a bird sanctuary located in the south end of [[Newark Bay]] off the north shore of [[Staten Island]]. (The small portion in New Jersey is further divided between two counties.)
** Delaware and Maryland share [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]].
** Maryland and Virginia share [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]], as well as [[Assateague Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Virginia and North Carolina share [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]], [[Mon Island, North Carolina|Mon Island]] and [[Simon Island, Virginia|Simon Island]], separated from the Atlantic by an intracoastal waterway.
** North Carolina and South Carolina share [[Bird Island, North Carolina|Bird Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Florida and Alabama share [[Perdido Key]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share [[South Rigolets Island]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share an island between [[Bayou Heron]] and [[Mattie Clark Bayou]] on the Gulf Coast.
** Minnesota and Wisconsin share [[Interstate Island]] State Wildlife Management Area in [[Saint Louis River|Saint Louis Bay]] between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin.
** Michigan and Ohio share [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] in Lake Erie.
** At the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Oregon and Washington share [[Sand Island (Oregon)|Sand Island Dike]] and [[Rice Island (Oregon)|Rice Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/WA/jbh-lc/Draft%20CCP%20EIS/2%20Chapter%202%20Alternatives%20Goals%20Objectives%20and%20Strategies.pdf|title=Lewis and Clark and Julia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuges Draft CCP/EIS Chapter 2.

==== Separated by the Mississippi River ====
These border irregularities were caused by changes in the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]] or other river changes:

*Over a period of about 24 hours on 7 March 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that defined the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Tennessee's [[Reverie, Tennessee|Reverie]] and [[Corona, Tennessee|Corona]], located in [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] north-northwest of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | title = Tipton | work = Tennessee History for Kids | date = 2010-01-18 | publisher = Tennessee History for Kids | location = [[Nashville, Tennessee]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706152404/http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | archivedate = 2010-07-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other irregularities involving the [[Mississippi River]]: 
*Arkansas has territory at {{coord|35.65|N|89.87|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} across the Mississippi River on the northwest edge of Tennessee's [[Fort Pillow State Park]], north of the Corona/Reverie, Tennessee irregularity (mentioned in the previous section).
*Illinois's [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], Missouri's [[Grand Tower Island]] and other Illinois and Missouri territory on each other's side of the Mississippi River.
*The [[Kentucky Bend]] between Missouri and Tennessee.
*The state of [[Mississippi]] controls at least 11 exclaves on the west bank of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], while Louisiana owns 8 exclaves on Mississippi's side.
*Louisiana and Mississippi also share 3 islands, at 31.754078 degrees north, 91.376270 west; 31.885015 north, 91.228315 west; as well as [[Middle Ground Island]], Togo Island, Davis Island at {{coord|32.13|N|91.05|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, an island at {{coord|32.371|N|90.889|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Stack Island at {{coord|32.824|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Cottonwood Island at {{coord|32.651|N|91.157|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, and an island at {{coord|32.674|N|91.147|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas share an island at their tri-point at {{coord|33.006|N|91.169|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi also owns 14 exclaves on the bank in [[Arkansas]], while Arkansas has 15 of its own on Mississippi's side.

*There are also many irregularities along the river between Arkansas/Tennessee, Missouri/Tennessee, and Missouri/Kentucky.

=== Other irregularities ===

*The [[Wedge (border)|Delaware Wedge]] adjacent to Maryland and Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url = http://chriswhong.com/mdbounds/ | title = The Boundary Disputes of Colonial Maryland | first = Christopher M. | last = Whong | date = 2000-12-11 | location = [[Baltimore, Maryland]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Erie Triangle]].
*Michigan's [[Lost Peninsula]] Marina and neighboring [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Washington Township, Lucas County, Ohio]]; resulting from [[Monroe County, Michigan#Border disputes|Toledo War border realignment]].
*Massachusetts's [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick Jog]].
*Missouri's [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]].
*The above-water portion of [[Liberty Island]] is part of [[New York State]], but being located in [[New York Bay]], is entirely surrounded by the waters of [[New Jersey]]. Ellis Island is also in the waters of New Jersey, but the naturally formed part of the island belongs to New York, while the artificial infill portion surrounding it belongs to New Jersey. The original land area of Ellis Island is a true exclave of New York State.

==Highway system irregularities==
*[[Oklahoma State Highway 20]] forms a concurrency with [[Arkansas Highway 43]] between [[Maysville, Arkansas]] and the [[Missouri]] state line, where AR-43 becomes [[Missouri Highway 43]].
*[[Interstate 24]] briefly enters [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a few miles but comes back into [[Tennessee]], and retains Tennessee exit numbers, but not Tennessee mile markers.
*[[Minnesota State Highway 23]] enters [[Wisconsin]] near [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] for half a mile.
*[[Interstate 684]], otherwise in New York, takes a shortcut across the northwest corner of the [[Connecticut Panhandle]] without any exits or signage save a standard Connecticut sign welcoming travelers to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].
*[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]], formerly [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]], drops just south of the [[New York-Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] for two miles between [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]] and [[Sayre, Pennsylvania|Sayre]]. The crossing is indicated by signs in both directions, but the New York signage and exit numbering remain (prior to being converted to an interstate, Route 17's sequential exit numbering began at its Pennsylvania terminus and continued into New York, one of the few highways in the U.S. where this was so; however, it is not uncommon for state highways to retain their route numbers when they change state highway shields at the border).
*[[New York State Route 120A]] runs along the Connecticut state line for much of its length, apart from 3.6 miles that enter the state, yet retains its New York signage and is still maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].
*Montana State Highway 43 runs for approximately one mile inside Idaho, between [[Chief Joseph Pass]] and [[Lost Trail Pass]]. It crosses into Montana again just yards from its junction with [[US 93]].
*The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carries [[I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] (the Capitol Beltway) across the [[Potomac River]] south of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. It connects [[Maryland]] on the east shore of the river with [[Virginia]] on the west shore. However, a few hundred feet of roadway close to the Virginia side crosses the southernmost point of the District of Columbia and thus is in neither Maryland nor Virginia.
*13 miles of [[Pennsylvania Route 426]] goes through [[New York (state)|New York]], though unlike other state highways on the list that briefly enter other states with their normal symbols, this one is badged as [[New York State Route 426]] between both borders of [[Pennsylvania]].
*Highways [[U.S. Route 2|US-2]] and [[U.S. Route 141|US-141]] run in the state of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] twice nonconsecutively.

===Highway exclaves===
Some highways are not connected to the rest of their nominal highway systems:
*In addition to Alaska and Hawaii being separated from the [[Contiguous United States|Lower 48]], each has discontinuous road systems that are internally isolated. [[Alaska Route 7]] and the other roads near [[Juneau, Alaska]] remain separated by [[ferry]] from other road systems.
*[[Abbott Drive|Iowa Highway 165]] in Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only state highway in Iowa to be entirely west of the [[Missouri River]]. The highway is the middle span of the [[Omaha, Nebraska]] road named [[Abbott Drive]], and is not directly connected to any other street. The rest of Carter Lake is a separate street system exclave accessible only from Locust Street or Avenue H in Omaha.
*In [[Atchison County, Missouri]], [[Missouri supplemental route]] V is separated from the rest of Missouri's highway system. It connects only to roads in [[Fremont County, Iowa]]. This is due to lying northwest of the [[Nishnabotna River]].
*[[New York State Route 171]], near [[Utica, New York|Utica]], does not intersect any other state highways (it once did, with [[New York State Route 5S|NY 5S]], but a realignment of that route took it away from the one intersection that NY 171 had).
*[[New Jersey Route 324]] is an isolated route in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]] that connects to the former docks of a ferry on the [[Delaware River]] carrying [[US Route 322]] to [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. The ferry was replaced by the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] in 1974. Route 324 used to connect to [[New Jersey Route 44]] at its eastern end prior to a realignment.
*A [[Pond Eddy Bridge|bridge]] connecting to [[Pond Eddy, Pennsylvania]] across the Delaware River to New York State is owned by Pennsylvania, despite having no connection to the rest of Pennsylvania's road network. One must use [[New York Route 97]] to cross back over the river at [[Narrowsburg, New York]] or [[Port Jervis, New York]], a distance of approximately {{convert|14|mi}}. When the original bridge needed replacement, Pennsylvania had considered buying out the property owners and demolishing the town and the bridge. (Bridges over the Delaware River between the two states are maintained by a joint commission&lt;!--The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission is a compact between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York is not involved in it at all.--&gt; operated by the transportation departments of both states.)
*County Highway 330 services [[Angle Inlet, Minnesota]]. It does not connect to any U.S. highway, rather connecting to [[Manitoba Provincial Road 525|Provincial Road 525]] in [[Manitoba|Manitoba, Canada]].
*[[M-185 (Michigan highway)|M-185]] in [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Michigan]] serves as a beltway around the island, and is the only highway in the U.S. that bans cars and only allows runners and [[Cycling|bicyclists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/expo/erry-2018/03/797a7e7b1b/a_guide_to_michigans_m185_the.html|title=A guide to Michigan's M-185, the only U.S. highway where cars are banned|work=MLive.com|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not connect to any other highway, and the only way to access it or the island are via [[ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mackinacisland.org/stay/getting-here/|title=Directions, Mackinac Island, MI - Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|work=Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[St. Clair County, Michigan]], highway [[M-154 (Michigan highway)|M-154]] runs on [[Harsens Island]], although it does connect via ferry to nearby highway [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]].

A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., &amp; Roe P. (1984) Reading the country: An introduction to nomadology. Fremantle, W.A.: Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying boundaries ==
[[File:Property line, crossing is by revocable license only.jpg|thumb|A private property line plaque separating the private property and the public [[right of way]] on a [[sidewalk]] in [[New York City]]. It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a [[prescriptive easement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Cora|last2=Randolph|first2=Mary|title=Neighbor law : fences, trees, boundaries, and noise|date=1994|publisher=Nolo Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780873372664|edition=2nd|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|chapter=Easements Acquired by Use of Property|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213516/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf#|archive-date=2015-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The &amp;#8522; symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caribmap is created and directed by a scientist, [[S. Blair Hedges]], who is responsible for managing all content.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt; It has received large donations of map images from public and private institutions such as the [[Branner Earth Sciences Library|Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp; Map Collections]] of [[Stanford University]], the [[Norman B. Leventhal Map Center]] at the [[Boston Public Library]], the [[Perry–Castañeda Library|Perry-Castañeda Library]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] of the [[University of Florida]].

== Contents ==

Caribmap encompasses the geographic range of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its islands, including those bordering the Middle and South American mainland, such as the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] of [[Honduras]], [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] ([[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]]), [[Trinidad]], and [[Tobago]]. The [[Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] are also incorporated due to their cultural, economic, and historic links to the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

The site features scans of high-resolution maps, organized by islands, which allow the capability to zoom in on details of historic or scientific importance. Map thumbnail images pertaining to that island are sorted in chronological order by the year the map was made, above the viewing area. Bibliographic information (title, year, maker, medium, size, and credit) is displayed under each map. The site also has a feature called “map tours,” focused on individual islands (currently only Jamaica), which are short videos featuring historical maps and 3D scenes from [[Google Earth]]. One demonstrated use of Caribmap, given its large number of high-resolution map images, has been quantitative historical analysis, which traces the use of [[toponymy|toponyms]] (place names) through time.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2402">The '''circle of equal altitude''' also called circle of position, CoP, is the real line of position in [[celestial navigation]]. It is defined as the locus of the Earth on which an observer sees a star, at a given time, with the same observed altitude.

[[File:Sumner - circle of equal altitude.jpg|thumb|Discovery of the circle of equal altitude - A New and Accurate Method of Finding a Ship's Position at Sea, by Projection on Mercator's Chart, Capt. Thomas H. Sumner, July 1843, Thomas Groom &amp; Company of Boston]]

== Parameters ==
[[File:CoP - Circunferencia de alturas iguales.png|thumb|Parameters of a circle of equal altitude]]
The center of the CoP, is the substellar point or geographical position of the observed body, and its radius is the great circle distance equal to the zenith distance of the body.

* Center = geographical position of the body: (''B'', ''L'') = (''Dec'', ''GHA'')
* Radius = zenith distance: ''zd'' [nm] = 60 ⋅ (90 - ''Ho'')

== Equation ==
The equation links the following variables&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/navigationalalgorithms/papersnavigation Vector equation of the Circle of Position]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The position of the observer: ''B'', ''L''.
* The coordinates of the observed star, its geographical position: ''GHA'', ''Dec''.
* The true altitude of the body: ''Ho''.

'''&lt;math&gt;\sin(Ho) = \sin(B) \cdot \sin(Dec) + \cos(B) \cdot \cos(Dec) \cdot \cos(LHA)\,&lt;/math&gt;'''

Being ''B'' the latitude (+N/S), ''L'' the longitude (+E/-W). ''LHA'' = ''GHA'' + ''L'' is the local hour angle, ''Dec'' and ''GHA'' are the declination and Greenwich hour angle of the star observed. And ''Ho'' is the true or observed altitude, that is, the altitude measured with sextant corrected for dip, refraction, parallax.

== Special cases ==
* Parallel of latitude by Polaris altitude.
* Parallel of latitude by altitude of the sun at noon, or meridian altitude.
* Meridian of longitude known the time and latitude.
* Circle of illumination or terminator

'''Constant bearing, decreasing range''' (CBDR) is a term in [[navigation]] which means that some object, usually another [[ship]] viewed from the deck or bridge of one's own ship, is getting closer but maintaining the same relative [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]].  If this continues, the objects will collide.&lt;ref name="Peppe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peppe |first1=Kevin (Commander, US Navy) |title=Constant Bearing, Decreasing Range|journal=US Naval Institute Proceedings |date=December 1996 |volume=122 |issue=12/1 |page=126 |url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1996-12/constant-bearing-decreasing-range}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logan |first1=Doug|title=Collision Course with a Crossing Boat?

==Risk==
Sailors, especially deck hands and those who [[Watchstanding|stand watch]] on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], are trained to watch for this situation and make it known when they detect it happening.  The reasoning is subtle: non-sailors who are used to driving automobiles normally are able to detect the possible risk of a collision with implicit reference to the background (e.g., the street, the scenery, the landscape, etc.)  At sea, when vessels are borne in water, the sea surface removes this vital visual clue.  Unaware individuals tend to gauge the risk of two vessels colliding based on which direction each vessel is heading.  In other words, a novice will think that two vessels which appear to be heading apart from each other cannot collide.  This is false, as when a faster vessel is overtaking a slower one, they can in fact have a collision even though the vessels are on substantially different headings.

On a river, CBDR is less useful, as it is likely that both the observed and the observing vessel will follow curving courses along the waterway, whether or not they are on a collision course. In such situations safe navigation depends on upstream and downstream traffic keeping to separate sectors of the navigable channel.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Gregory L. (Captain)|title=For river pilots, tri-sectoring most effective way to determine collision risk|journal=Professional Mariner|date=February 2017|issue=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual clues==

When a non-moving background (typically the shore line) is present, CBDR situations can be recognized by the fact that some part of the moving target vessel is not visually moving against the background. On the other hand, if the target vessel visually moves forward against the background, with relative bearing decreasing, then the target vessel will pass in front of the observing vessel and there is no risk of collision, provided both vessels maintain constant speed and course.  Similarly, if the target vessel visually moves backwards against the background, with relative bearing increasing, the target vessel will pass behind the observing vessel. However, this method of recognizing non-CBDR conditions is only true for relatively small observing vessels. With larger vessels, only an observer positioned near the bow can reliably make the first conclusion, whereas the second conclusion can only be left to an observer positioned near the stern.

==Relative bearing==
Another source of confusion arises from the distinction between ''[[relative bearing]]'' and ''[[absolute bearing]]''.  One might think that another vessel which seems to be progressing from, perhaps, dead ahead to apparent movement down one's [[starboard]] side cannot result in a collision.  This is not quite true.  Because a vessel afloat can change its true heading (relative to north) without obvious detection (unless there are landmarks in sight) two vessels may collide even if one presents a substantially changing relative bearing.

A '''Daboll trumpet''' is an air trumpet [[foghorn]] which was developed by an American, [[Celadon Leeds Daboll]], of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut.  It was basically a small coal-fired [[hot air engine]], which compressed air in a cylinder on top of which was a reed horn.

The Daboll trumpet, consists of a steel reed vibrating within a horn, which uses the hot air engine to force cold air by means of an air pump into a boiler, from which it escapes into the horn through a valve, causing the vibrations of the reed, which are regulated by an automatic cam.

Daboll's cousin, Charles Miner Daboll (1823-), inventor of the [[Daboll bushing]], is credited with developing the Daboll trumpet for practical use.

The following citation is from: ''Scientific American Supplement'', Vol. XIX, No. 470, Jan. 3, 1885.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Daboll trumpet was invented by Mr. C.L. Daboll, of
Connecticut, who was experimenting to meet the announced wants of the
United States Lighthouse Board. The largest consists of a huge trumpet
seventeen feet long, with a throat three and one-half inches in diameter,
and a flaring mouth thirty-eight inches across. In the trumpet is a
resounding cavity, and a tongue-like steel reed ten inches long, two and
three-quarter inches wide, one inch thick at its fixed end, and half that
at its free end. Air is condensed in a reservoir and driven through the
trumpet by hot air or steam machinery at a pressure of from fifteen to
twenty pounds, and is capable of making a shriek which can be heard at a
great distance for a certain number of seconds each minute, by about
one-quarter of the power expended in the case of the whistle. In all his
experiments against and at right angles and at other angles to the wind,
the trumpet stood first and the whistle came next in power. In the trial
of the relative power of various instruments made by Gen. Duane in 1874,
the twelve-inch whistle was reported as exceeding the first-class Daboll
trumpet. Beaseley reports that the trumpet has done good work at various
British stations, making itself heard from five to ten miles. The engineer
in charge of the lighthouses of Canada says: "The expense for repairs, and
the frequent stoppages to make these repairs during the four years they
continued in use, made them [the trumpets] expensive and unreliable. The
frequent stoppages during foggy weather made them sources of danger
instead of aids to navigation. The sound of these trumpets has
deteriorated during the last year or so." Gen. Duane, reporting as to his
experiments in 1881, says: "The Daboll trumpet, operated by a caloric
engine, should only be employed in exceptional cases, such as at stations
where no water can be procured, and where from the proximity of other
signals it may be necessary to vary the nature of the sound." Thus it
would seem that the Daboll trumpet is an exceptionally fine instrument,
producing a sound of great penetration and of sufficient power for
ordinary practical use, but that to be kept going it requires skillful
management and constant care.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Congress made an appropriation in 1860 authorizing the Light-House Board to make
experiments with "Daboll's trumpet and other ear signals," but nothing was done until some time later."

Daboll's trumpet were installed at the following during trials:

[[File:Dioptra-principe.jpg|right|thumb|384px|Three stages in the evolution of the dioptra, from a simple horizontal sight, to a multi-angle measuring tool]]
A '''dioptra''' (sometimes also named '''dioptre''' or '''diopter''' from {{lang-el|διόπτρα}}) is a [[Hellenistic civilization|classical]] astronomical and [[surveying instrument]], dating from the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BCE. The '''dioptra''' was a sighting tube or, alternatively, a rod with a sight at both ends, attached to a stand. If fitted with [[protractor]]s, it could be used to measure [[angle]]s.

==Use==
[[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] used the dioptra to [[astrometry|measure the positions of stars]]; both [[Euclid]] and [[Geminus]] refer to the dioptra in their astronomical works. By the time of [[Ptolemy]] (2nd&amp;nbsp;century CE), it was obsolete as an astronomical instrument, having been replaced by the [[armillary sphere]].

It continued in use as an effective [[surveying]] tool. Adapted to surveying, the dioptra is similar to the [[theodolite]], or surveyor's transit, which dates to the sixteenth century. It is a more accurate version of the [[Groma surveying|groma]].

The dioptra may have been sophisticated enough, for example, to construct a tunnel through two opposite points in a mountain. There is some speculation that it may have been used to build the [[Eupalinian aqueduct]]. Called "one of the greatest engineering achievements of ancient times," it is a tunnel 1,036&amp;nbsp;meters (4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long, "excavated through [[Mount Kastro]] on the Greek island of [[Samos Island|Samos]], in the 6th century BCE" during the reign of [[Polycrates]].  Scholars disagree whether the dioptra was available that early.&lt;ref name=Apostol&gt;{{cite web|last=Apostol|first=Tom M.|title=The Tunnel of Samos|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4106/1/Samos.pdf|publisher=caltech.edu|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire book about the construction and surveying usage of the dioptra is credited to [[Hero of Alexandria]] (also known as Heron; a brief description of the book is available online; see Lahanas link, below). Hero was "one of history’s most ingenious [[engineer]]s and applied [[mathematician]]s."

The dioptra was used extensively on [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] building projects. Screw turns on several different parts of the instrument made it easy to calibrate for very precise measurements

The dioptra was replaced as a surveying instrument by the [[theodolite]].

Originally, ''earth'' was written in lowercase, and from [[early Middle English]], its [[definite]] sense as "the globe" was expressed as ''[[definite article|the]] earth''. By [[Early Modern English]], many nouns were capitalized, and ''the earth'' became (and often remained) ''the Earth'', particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies.

Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by ''the'' (e.g. "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''The New Oxford Dictionary of English'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "earth".

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}. The last continental glaciation ended {{val|10000|u=years|fmt=commas}} ago.&lt;ref name=psc/&gt;

A half billion years later, the [[last universal common ancestor|last common ancestor of all current life]] arose.&lt;ref name=sa282_6_90/&gt; The evolution of [[photosynthesis]] allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

{{Main|Figure of the Earth|Earth radius}}
The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=layers_earth/&gt; [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.&lt;ref name=jessey/&gt; The third form of rock material found on Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.

===Hydrosphere===
{{Main|Hydrosphere}}
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|Elevation histogram of Earth's surface]]
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=Gya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] and, indirectly, the formation of the [[ozone layer]] due to the subsequent [[Ozone–oxygen cycle|conversion of atmospheric {{chem2|O2}} into {{chem2|O3}}]]. The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?  This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 [[gene]]s from the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA) of all [[organism]]s living on Earth.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Meet Luca, the Ancestor of All Living Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/science/last-universal-ancestor.html |date=25 July 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

==Human geography==

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

==Asteroids and artificial satellites==

[[Culture|Human cultures]] have developed many views of the planet. Earth is sometimes [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] as a [[deity]]. In many cultures it is a [[mother goddess]] that is also the primary [[fertility deity]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Thematic Guide to World Mythology |last=Stookey |first=Lorena Laura |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-313-31505-3 |location=Westport, Conn. |pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid-20th century, the [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Principle]] compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James.

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a [[flat Earth]] was gradually displaced in the Greek colonies of southern Italy during the late 6th century BC by the idea of [[spherical Earth]],&lt;ref name=russell1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1971"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burkert |first=Walter |author-link=Walter Burkert |date=1 June 1972 |title=Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0qqp4Vk1zG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=onepage&amp;q=Pythagoreanism |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-53918-1 |pages=306–308 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahn2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles H. |date=2001 |title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: A Brief History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GKUtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Pythagoreanism#v=snippet&amp;q=Empedocles%20spherical |location=Indianapolis, Indiana and Cambridge, England |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-87220-575-8 |page=53 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was attributed to both the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Parmenides]].&lt;ref name="Burkert1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kahn2001"/&gt; By the end of the 5th century BC, the [[sphericity]] of Earth was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicks |first=D.

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] used [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and [[Radiometric dating|radioactive dating]] were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Equation for Every Occasion: Fifty-Two Formulas and Why They Matter |last=Henshaw |first=John M. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-421-41491-1 |location= |pages=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth |last=Burchfield |first=Joe D. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 |location= |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/06/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-space-matters-watch/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Why Space Matters |work=[[The Alcalde]] |first=Rose |last=Cahalan |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Aoki&gt;The ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".—{{cite journal |last=Aoki |first=S. |title=The new definition of universal time |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=1982 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=359–61 |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...105..359A |last2=Kinoshita |first2=H. |last3=Guinot |first3=B. |last4=Kaplan |first4=G.

&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=hill_radius&gt;For Earth, the [[Hill radius]] is &lt;math&gt;R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass of Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=jaes41_3_379&gt;Including the [[Somali Plate]], which is being formed out of the African Plate. See: {{cite journal |first=Jean |last=Chorowicz |date=October 2005 |title=The East African rift system |journal=[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]] |volume=43 |issue=1–3 |pages=379–410 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.07.019 |bibcode=2005JAfES..43..379C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sidereal_solar&gt;The number of solar days in a year is one less than the number of [[sidereal day]]s (the time it takes the Earth to revolve exactly 360 degrees around its axis) because a solar day is about 236 seconds longer than a sidereal day. Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=trench_depth&gt;This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''[[Kaikō]]'' in March 1995 and is considered the most accurate measurement to date. See the [[Challenger Deep]] article for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=space_debris&gt;As of 4 January 2018, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 18,835 artificial objects, mostly debris.

The era of '''European and American voyages of scientific exploration''' followed the [[Age of Discovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brosse|1983|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were inspired by a new confidence in science and reason that arose in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Maritime expeditions in the Age of Discovery were a means of expanding colonial empires, establishing new trade routes and extending diplomatic and trade relations to new territories, but with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] scientific curiosity became a new motive for exploration to add to the commercial and political ambitions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/age_of_enlightenment.htm|title=The age of Enlightenment|author=Hackett, Louis|year=1992|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[List of Arctic expeditions]] and [[List of Antarctic expeditions]].

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery==
From the early 15th century to the early 17th century the Age of Discovery had, through Spanish and Portuguese seafarers, opened up southern Africa, the Americas (New World), Asia and [[Oceania]] to European eyes: [[Bartholomew Dias]] had sailed around the Cape of southern Africa in search of a trade route to India; [[Christopher Columbus]], on four journeys across the Atlantic, had prepared the way for European colonisation of the New World; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] had commanded the first expedition to sail across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans to complete the first [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth. Over this period colonial power shifted from the Portuguese and Spanish to the Dutch and then the British and French. The new era of scientific exploration began in the late 17th century as scientists, and in particular natural historians, established scientific societies that published their researches in specialist journals. The British [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660 and encouraged the scientific rigour of empiricism with its principles of careful observation and deduction. Activities of early members of the Royal Society served as models for later maritime exploration. [[Hans Sloane]] (1650–1753) was elected a member in 1685 and travelled to Jamaica from 1687 to 1689 as physician to the [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]] (1653–1688) who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica. In Jamaica Sloane collected numerous specimens which were carefully described and illustrated in a published account of his stay.&lt;ref&gt;See{{Harvnb|Sloane|1707–1725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloane bequeathed his vast collection of natural history 'curiosities' and library of over 50,000 bound volumes to the nation, prompting the establishment in 1753 of the [[British Museum]]. His travels also made him an extremely wealthy man as he patented a recipe that combined milk with the fruit of ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' (cocoa) he saw growing in Jamaica, to produce milk chocolate.  Books of distinguished social figures like the intellectual commentator [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], Director of the [[Paris Museum of Natural History]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], and scientist-travellers like [[Joseph Banks]], and [[Charles Darwin]], along with the romantic and often fanciful  [[travelogue (literature)|travelogues]] of intrepid explorers, increased the desire of European governments and the general public for accurate information about the newly discovered distant lands.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Speake|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest French expeditions on the coasts of Africa, South America and through the [[Strait of Magellan]] was made by a squadron of French [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]] under the command of M. de Gennes in 1695–97. The young French explorer, engineer and hydrographer [[François Froger]] described this expedition in his ''[[A Relation of a Voyage]]'' (1699).

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Enlightenment==
By the 18th century maritime exploration had become safer and more efficient with technical innovations that vastly improved navigation and cartography: improvements were made to the [[theodolite]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]], precision [[clock]]s, as well as the [[compass]], [[telescope]], and general [[shipbuilding]] techniques.
From the mid-18th century through the 19th century scientific missions mapped the newly discovered regions, brought back to Europe the newly discovered [[fauna]] and [[flora]], made hydrological, astronomical and meteorological observations and improved the methods of navigation. This stimulated great advances in the scientific disciplines of [[natural history]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[ichthyology]], [[conchology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[medicine]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]] etc. – all contributing to the sense of "improvement" and "progress" that characterized the Enlightenment. Artists were used to record landscapes and indigenous peoples, while natural history illustrators captured the appearance of organisms before they deteriorated after collection.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 320"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the worlds finest natural history illustrations were produced at this time and the illustrators changed from informed amateurs to fully trained professionals acutely aware of the need for scientific accuracy.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century all of the world's major land masses, and most of the minor ones, had been discovered by Europeans and their coastlines charted.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 290"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of this phase of science as the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration#1873–76: HMS Challenger|''Challenger'' Expedition]] of 1872–1876 began exploring the deep seas beyond a depth of 20 or 30 meters. In spite of the growing community of scientists, for nearly 200 years science had been the preserve of wealthy amateurs, educated middle classes and clerics.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 320"/&gt; At the start of the 18th century most voyages were privately organized and financed but by the second half of the century these scientific expeditions, like [[James Cook]]'s three Pacific voyages under the auspices of the British Admiralty, were instigated by government.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 10"/&gt; In the late 19th century, when this phase of science was drawing to a close, it became possible to earn a living as a professional scientist although photography was beginning to replace the illustrators. The exploratory sailing ship had gradually evolved into the modern [[research vessel]]s. From now on maritime research in new European colonies in America, Africa, Australia, India and elsewhere, would be carried out by researchers within the occupied territories themselves.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 290"/&gt;

=== Chronology of voyages ===
This compendium of voyages of scientific exploration provides an overview of maritime scientific research carried out at the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe.
Published journals and accounts are included with the individual voyages.

==== 1764–66 : HMS ''Dolphin'' ====
[[File:HMS Dolphin 1751.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Dolphin'' at Tahiti in 1767]]
Considered the first scientific voyage undertaken by the Royal Navy, its primary purpose was the discovery of new lands in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It was during this trip that several islands of the [[Tuamotu archipelago]] were discovered. {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}} was a 24-gun post ship launched in 1751 and used as a [[survey ship]] from 1764, making two [[circumnavigation]]s under the command of [[John Byron]] and [[Samuel Wallis]]. She was broken up in 1777.

** Captain: [[John Byron]] (1723–1786).
** Publications: J. Byron, ''A Voyage round the world.'' (London, 1767), translated into French the same year under the title ''Journey around the world in 1764 and 1765, on the English warship "The Dolphin", commissioned by Vice-Admiral Byron ...'' (Paris).

==== 1766–68 : HMS ''Dolphin'' and HMS ''Swallow'' ====
A circumnavigation by the English navigator [[Samuel Wallis]], on board {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}}, accompanied by [[Philip Carteret]] on the consort ship {{HMS|Swallow|1766|2}}. In August 1766, the two ships passed through the [[Strait of Magellan]]. In December 1766, conflicts between the two captains led to the separation of the ships. ''Dolphin'' reached [[Tahiti]] in June 1767. Samuel Wallis studied the customs of the Polynesians, reaching the [[Dutch East Indies]] at [[Jakarta|Batavia]], returning to London in May 1768. Meanwhile, Philip Carteret in ''Swallow'' explored and studied the [[Solomon Islands]], [[New Ireland (island)]] (now part of Papua New Guinea) and the islands of the Indonesian archipelago ([[Sulawesi]] among others). The expedition also stopped in Batavia from June to September 1768 and returned to London in March 1769.

** Captains: [[Samuel Wallis]] (1728–1795) (leader of the expedition), [[Philip Carteret]] (1733–1796) (Commander of ''Swallow'' which was separated from the ''Dolphin'' and returned to its point of departure a year later).

[[File:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|[[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|''La Boudeuse'']] arriving in [[Matavai Bay|Matavai]] in 1767]]
Ordered by [[Louis XV]], it is the first trip around the world initiated by the French. The discovery and description of [[Tahiti]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] in his trip will have a very significant impact on the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778). The expedition was organised by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] and received the support of such prominent figures of the time as [[Charles de Brosses]] (1709–1777), [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788), [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] (1698–1759) and [[Jérôme Lalande]] (1732–1807).

The purpose of the expedition is to discover new territories available for [[Human settlement|settlement]], to open a new route to reach China, to found new outlets for the [[French East India Company]] and, finally, discover acclimatable spices for the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]).

Captain Kermadec died in May 1793 and Captain d'Entrecasteaux in July of the same year. The expedition was headed by a royalist and heard of the terror in France when putting into the Dutch colonies. The crew was arrested and collections of natural history confiscated and offered by the Dutch to the British. These were however, on the express request of [[Joseph Banks]] (1743–1820), returned to France

** Captains: [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux|Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (1737–1793) (''[[La Recherche]]'') and [[Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec|Jean-Michel de Kermadec]] (1748–1793) (''[[L'Espérance (ship)|L'Espérance]]'')

==== 1791–93: HMS ''Providence''====
The Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce offered a reward of fifty pounds for living Bread-fruit plants. Bligh completed this in {{HMS|Providence|1791|2}}, his second mission to collect [[breadfruit]] plants and other botanical specimens from the Pacific. These he transported to the West Indies, specimens being given to the [[Botanic Gardens St. Vincent|Royal Botanic Gardens in St. Vincent]]. This expedition was a success, returning to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens Kew]] with 1,283 plants including varieties of apple, pear, oranges and mangoes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In addition to these specimens, the expedition accomplished many observations and cartographic surveys in the South Seas.

====1791–95: HMS ''Discovery'' and HMS ''Chatham''====
[[File:HMS Discovery 1789 Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} in 1789]]
{{Main|Vancouver Expedition}}
A mission to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and Pacific Northwest coast of America. In 1791, {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} left England with {{HMS|Chatham|1788|2}}. Both ships anchored at [[Cape Town]] before exploring the south coast of Australia. In King George Sound, the Discovery's naturalist and surgeon Archibald Menzies collected various plant species including ''[[Banksia grandis]]'', the first recording of the genus ''[[Banksia]]'' from Western Australia. The two ships sailed to Hawai{{okina}}i where Vancouver named Kamehameha I. Chatham and Discovery then sailed on to the Northwest Pacific. Over the course of the next four years, Vancouver surveyed the northern Pacific Ocean coast in Discovery wintering in Spanish California or Hawai{{okina}}i. Discovery's primary mission was to exert British sovereignty over this part of the Northwest Coast following the hand-over of the Spanish Fort San Miguel at Nootka Sound, although exploration in co-operation with the Spanish was seen as an important secondary objective. Exploration work was successful as relations with the Spanish went well; resupply in California was especially helpful. Vancouver and the Spanish commandant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra were on such good terms that the original name of Vancouver Island was actually ''Quadra and Vancouver's Island''.

** Captains: [[George Vancouver]] (1757–1798) (''Discovery'') and [[William Robert Broughton]] (1763–1822) (''Chatham'')

==== 1838–42: USS ''Vincennes'' and USS ''Peacock'' ====
[[File:Vincennes.jpg|thumb|USS ''Vincennes'' in Disappointment Bay, Antarctica, during the Wilkes expedition.]]
{{Main|United States Exploring Expedition}}
The "Wilkes Expedition", included [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], [[taxidermist]]s, [[artist]]s and a [[philologist]] in the ships [[USS Vincennes (1826)|''Vincennes'']], [[USS Peacock (1828)|''Peacock'']], the [[brig]] [[USS Porpoise (1836)|''Porpoise'']], the store-ship [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], and two [[schooner]]s, [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']], and [[USS Flying Fish (1838)|''Flying Fish'']].

Departing [[Hampton Roads]] on 18 August 18, 1838, the expedition stopped at [[Madeira]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Argentina; visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], the [[Tuamotu]] Archipelago, [[Samoa]], and [[New South Wales]]. From [[Sydney]], Australia, the fleet sailed into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] in December 1839 and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]" of which it sighted the coast on January 25, 1840. Next, the expedition visited [[Fiji]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1840. In July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on [[Malolo]], in [[Fiji]]. Wilkes retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man of Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident.

From December 1840 to March 1841, his men with [[native Hawaiian]] porters hauled a [[pendulum]] to the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] to measure gravity. He explored the west coast of [[North America]], including the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Puget Sound]], the [[Columbia River]], [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento River]], in 1841.
The expedition returned by way of the [[Philippines]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Borneo]], [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[New York City]] on 10 June 1842. This was the first circumnavigation of the world funded by the Government of the [[United States]] and the last by a sailing vessel. The expedition was poorly prepared and of five vessels which left, only two returned to port. The natural history collections were very rich with 50,000 plant specimens (approximately 10&amp;nbsp;000 species) and 4,000 specimens of animals (half being new species).

[[File:Visual-fix-by-three-bearings.png|thumb|right|Visual fix by three bearings plotted on a nautical chart]]In [[position fixing]] [[navigation]], a '''position fix''' (PF) or simply a '''fix''' is a position derived from measuring in relation to external reference points.

In nautical applications, the term is generally used with manual or visual techniques such as the use of intersecting visual or radio [[position line]]s rather than the use of more automated and accurate electronic methods such as [[GPS]]; in aviation, use of electronic navigation aids is more common. A visual fix can be made by using any sighting device with a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] indicator. Two or more objects of known position are sighted, and the bearings recorded. Bearing lines are then plotted on a chart through the locations of the sighted items. The intersection of these lines is the current position of the vessel.

Usually, a fix is where two or more position lines intersect at any given time. If three position lines can be obtained, the resulting "cocked hat", where the three lines do not intersect at the same point, but create a triangle, gives the navigator an indication of the accuracy.

The most accurate fixes occur when the position lines are at right angles to each other.

Fixes are a necessary part of navigation by [[dead reckoning]] because dead reckoning relies on estimates of [[speed]] and [[course (navigation)|course]]. The fix confirms the actual position during a journey. The fix itself can introduce inaccuracies if the reference point is not correctly identified or is inaccurately measured.

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Unification of Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics and of the Four Forces |author1=J X Zheng-Johansson |author2=Per-Ivar Johansson |page=13

|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; by establishing a ''coordinate system'' ''R'' with origin ''O''. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, can be considered to give a physical realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates are changed from ''R'' to ''R′'' by carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of ''intrinsic'' objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities ''in this frame''.| Jean Salençon, Stephen Lyle ''Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity'' p. 9}}

{{Cquote|The idea of a reference frame is really quite different from that of a coordinate system. Frames differ just when they define different ''spaces'' (sets of ''rest'' points) or times (sets of simultaneous events). So the ideas of a space, a time, of rest and simultaneity, go inextricably together with that of frame. However, a mere shift of origin, or a purely spatial rotation of space coordinates results in a new coordinate system. So frames correspond at best to ''classes'' of coordinate systems.|Graham Nerlich: ''What Spacetime Explains'', p. 64}}

{{Cquote|In traditional developments of special and general relativity it has been customary not to distinguish between two quite distinct ideas. The first is the notion of a coordinate system, understood simply as the smooth, invertible assignment of four numbers to events in spacetime neighborhoods. The second, the frame of reference, refers to an idealized system used to assign such numbers …  To avoid unnecessary restrictions, we can divorce this arrangement from metrical notions. … Of special importance for our purposes is that each frame of reference has a definite state of motion at each event of spacetime.…Within the context of special relativity and as long as we restrict ourselves to frames of reference in inertial motion, then little of importance depends on the difference between an inertial frame of reference and the inertial coordinate system it induces. This comfortable circumstance ceases immediately once we begin to consider frames of reference in nonuniform motion even within special relativity.…More recently, to negotiate the obvious ambiguities of Einstein’s treatment, the notion of frame of reference has reappeared as a structure distinct from a coordinate system.|John D.

Although the term "coordinate system" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term "coordinate system" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.

Silverman |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRIjIx2ac6AC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=coordinate+metric|isbn=0-486-63833-2 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1979   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(ds)^2 = g_{ik}\ dx^i\ dx^k \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where repeated indices are summed over.

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Three frames of reference in special relativity. The black frame is at rest. The primed frame moves at 40% of light speed, and the double primed frame at 80%. Note the scissors-like change as speed increases.]]

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C. Møller |title=The Theory of Relativity |page=222 and p. 233 |year=1952 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lightman&gt;{{cite book |title=Problem Book in Relativity and Gravitation  |author1=A. P. Lightman |author2=W. H. Press |author3=R. H. Price |author4=S. A.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

==Examples of inertial frames of reference==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

'''GSHHG''' ('''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database'''; formerly ''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database'' (''GSHHS'')) is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two data bases (the CIA world database WDBII, and the World Vector Shoreline database) in the public domain. The data have undergone extensive processing and are free of internal inconsistencies such as [[erratic point]]s and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons. The four-level hierarchy is as follows: seashore, lakes, islands within lakes, ponds within islands within lakes.

The data can be used to simplify data searches and data selections, or to study the statistical characteristics of shorelines and land-masses. It comes with access software and routines to facilitate decimation based on a standard line-reduction algorithm.

GSHHS is developed and maintained by [[Paul Wessel (geophysicist)|Dr. Paul Wessel]] at the [[University of Hawai'i]], and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith at the [[NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry]].

[[File:IOM ET GENI LOCI.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Votive inscription to [[:en:Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] and the ''Genius loci'' by the [[Signifer]] of [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]] on behalf himself and his own legion during the consulate of Maternus and Atticus (185 AD)]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|classical Roman religion]], a '''''[[genius (mythology)|genius]] loci''''' ([[plural]] ''genii loci'') was the protective spirit of a place. It was often depicted in religious iconography as a figure holding attributes such as a [[cornucopia]], [[patera]] ([[libation]] bowl) or [[Serpent (symbolism)|snake]]. Many Roman altars found throughout the [[Western Roman Empire]] were dedicated to a particular ''genius locus''. The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cults of the Emperor]] and the imperial house developed in part in connections with the sacrifices made by neighborhood associations ''([[vicus|vici]])'' to the local ''genius''. These 265 local districts&lt;ref&gt;Number is for the city of Rome, cf. Plin. ''Nat. Hist.'' III, 66&lt;/ref&gt; had their cult organised around the ''Lares Compitales'' (guardian spirits or ''[[lares]]'' of the crossroads), which the emperor [[Augustus]] transformed into ''Lares Augusti'' along with the ''Genius Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Greg. (2008). "Divinity and Power in Ancient Rome" in ''Religion and Power: Divine Kingship in the Ancient World and Beyond''. Nicole Brisch (ed.)(Oriental Institute Seminars No. 4), Chicago: The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's ''genius'' is then regarded as the ''genius loci'' of the [[Roman Empire]] as a whole.

Roman examples of these Genii can be found, for example, at the [[Church (building)|church]] of St. Giles, [[Tockenham]], Wiltshire where the genius locus is depicted as a relief in the wall of a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church built of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] material. This shows "a youthful and curly-haired Roman Genius worked in high relief, holding a cornucopia in his left hand and a ''patera'' in his right", which previously has been "erroneously identified as [[Asclepius]]".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, J. M. C. (1978). "Two Romano-British Genii", in ''Britannia'', Vol. 9, p. 330. London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian usage==
The [[numen|numinous spirits]] of places in Asia are still honored today in [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]]s, outdoor [[spirit house]]s and indoor [[Shrine#Household shrines|household and business shrine]]s.

==Western usage==

In contemporary usage, ''genius loci'' usually refers to a location's distinctive atmosphere, or a "[[spirit of place]]", rather than necessarily a guardian spirit. An example of contemporary usage might be along the lines of "Light reveals the genius loci of a place."

==Art and architecture==
[[Alexander Pope]] made the Genius Loci an important principle in [[garden]] and landscape design with the following lines from ''Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Consult the genius of the place in all;
That tells the waters or to rise, or fall;
Or helps th' ambitious hill the heav'ns to scale,
Or scoops in circling theatres the vale;
Calls in the country, catches opening glades,
Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades,
Now breaks, or now directs, th' intending lines;
Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pope's verse laid the foundation for one of the most widely agreed principles of [[landscape architecture]]. This is the principle that landscape designs should ''always'' be adapted to the context in which they are located.

[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]], [[archetype]], and ''genius loci'' are the primary principals of Neo-Rationalism or New Rationalism. Pioneered by the Italian architect [[Aldo Rossi]], Neo-Rationalism developed in the light of a re-evaluation of the work of [[Giuseppe Terragni]], and gained momentum through the work of [[Giorgio Grassi]]. Characterized by elemental [[vernacular]] forms and an adaptation to the existing environment, the Neo-Rationalist style has adherents beyond architecture in the greater world of art.

In the context of modern architectural theory, ''genius loci'' has profound implications for place-making, falling within the philosophical branch of "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]". This field of architectural discourse is explored most notably by the theorist [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] in his book, ''Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture''.

==Modern fantasy==
In modern works of [[fantasy]], such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' or ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', a genius loci is an intelligent [[spirit]] or [[Magic (fantasy)|magical]] power that resides in a place. Very few genius loci of this form are able to move from their native area, either because they are "part of the land" or because they are bound to it. Genius loci are usually portrayed as being extremely powerful and usually also very intelligent, though there is a great deal of variability on these points. Some versions are nearly omnipotent and omniscient inside the area they inhabit, while others are simply vast, semi-sentient wellsprings of magical energy. This power almost never extends beyond the border of the genius loci.

Different settings give different explanations for the existence of genius loci. In most cases, however, the intelligent, magical entity simply develops from the similarly named "spirit of place" over a great deal of time. In other settings, genius loci are formed by powerful magical events, and in others they are the results of [[ley lines]], [[Mana#Mana in fantasy|mana pools]], or an equivalent.
&lt;!--
Note to any future editors: I don't have the expertise required to correctly comment this, so I'm going to leave it with the "citations needed" flag and simply list here a few probable good sources. These were my primary sources while writing this, but I've encountered genius loci in a number of other works (mostly short stories by various authors, although they're occasionally the monster of the week in epic fantasy novels).

Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 epic level handbook
''Turn Coat'': book 11 of ''The Dresden Files''

Most high fantasy settings that use a more literal hot-and-cold-running-mana system, as described in Niven's works, also sometimes feature intelligent mana pools. These share many similarities with genius loci even though they're not named as such. I haven't found any really good similar term/page for these (there isn't a mana pool page? Might have to create that), and I tend to conflate them anyway, so I've stuck a reference to intelligent mana pools in there.

'''GeoRSS''' is a specification for encoding location as part of a [[Web feed]]. ''(Web feeds are used to describe feeds ("channels") of content, such as news articles, [[MP3 blog|Audio blogs]], [[Vlog|video blogs]] and text [[blog]] entries. These [[web feed]]s are rendered by programs such as [[feed aggregator|aggregator]]s and [[web browser]]s.)'' The name "GeoRSS" is derived from [[RSS]], the most known [[Web feed]] and syndication format.

In GeoRSS, location content consists of geographical points, lines, and polygons of interest and related feature descriptions. GeoRSS feeds are designed to be consumed by geographic software such as map generators. By building these encodings on a common information model, the GeoRSS collaboration is promoting interoperability and "upwards-compatibility" across encodings.

At this point, the GeoRSS collaboration has completed work on two primary encodings that are called GeoRSS [[Geography Markup Language]] (GML) and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS-Simple is a very lightweight format that supports basic geometries (point, line, box, polygon) and covers the typical use cases when encoding locations. GeoRSS GML is a formal [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) GML Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than GeoRSS Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than [[World Geodetic System|WGS84]] latitude/longitude. There is also a [[Geography Markup Language|W3C]] GeoRSS serialization, which is older and partly deprecated but still the most widely used.

GeoRSS can be used to extend both RSS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]'s latest standard for feeds.

==Examples==
Here's a GeoRSS Simple example using Atom.
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;

A '''geographical cluster''' is a localised [[:wikt:anomaly|anomaly]], usually an excess of something given the [[spatial distribution|distribution]] or variation of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is considered as an [[incidence rate]] that is unusual in that there is more of some variable than might be expected. Examples would include: a local excess disease rate, a crime hot spot, areas of high unemployment, [[accident blackspot]]s, unusually high positive residuals from a model, high concentrations of flora or fauna, physical features or events like earthquake epicenters etc... {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

Identifying these extreme regions may be useful in that there could be implicit geographical associations with other variables that can be identified and would be of interest. Pattern detection via the identification of such geographical clusters is a very simple and generic form of geographical analysis that has many applications in many different contexts. The emphasis is on localized clustering or patterning because this may well contain the most useful information.  {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

A geographical cluster is different from a high concentration as it is generally second order, involving the factoring in of the distribution of something else. {{Fact|date=July 2014}}

==Geographical cluster detection==
Identifying geographical clusters can be an important stage in a geographical analysis. Mapping the locations of unusual concentrations may help identify causes of these. Some techniques include the Geographical Analysis Machine and Besag and Newell's cluster detection method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fotheringham|first1=A. Stewart|last2=Zhan|first2=F.

'''Hardscape''' refers to [[hard landscape materials]] in the [[built environment]] structures that are incorporated into a landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hardscape|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hardscape|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include paved areas, driveways, [[retaining walls]], sleeper walls, stairs, walkways, and any other landscaping made up of hard wearing materials such as wood, stone, concrete etc. as opposed to [[softscape]], the [[horticulture|horticultural]] elements of a [[landscape]].

Hard landscaping involves projects that cover the entirety of the yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. Hard landscaping is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the "bricks and mortar", and so only once this is completed can the landscaper begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting color schemes. One key feature of hard landscaping is to do with the absorption of water – something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard landscaping ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall is not an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard landscaping, coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that the yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space, rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is achieved through hard landscaping.

From an [[urban planning]] perspective, hardscapes can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains, and even small pools. Most [[water feature]]s are hardscapes because they require a barrier to retain the water, instead of letting it drain into the surrounding soil.

Hardscaping allows the erection of man-made landscaping features that would otherwise be impossible due to [[soil erosion]], including some that compensate for large amounts of human traffic that would cause wear on bare earth or grass. For example, sheer vertical features are possible.

Without nearby bare soil, or natural drainage channels or culverts, hardscape with an [[impervious surface]] requires artificial methods of [[drainage]] or [[surface runoff]] to carry off the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as [[groundwater]] and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, accelerated erosion, [[wet rot]] to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs, and even foundation problems to an adjacent home such as cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, and pest infiltration, such as ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.

==Regulations and licensing==

===Australia===
Hardscape landscaping in Queensland,&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Building and Construction Commission, http://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is a licensed qualification called Structural Landscaping, which is divided into two classes of licenses: Trade Contractor Structural Landscaper, and a Builder restricted to Structural Landscaping, referred to as the "jack of all trades" due to its large scope of works. These Structural Landscaping licenses include the erection and fabrication of decking, fences, carports, pergolas, paving and the construction of retaining walls.

'''Intermontane''' is a physiographic adjective [[wiktionary:compound#Adjective|formed from the prefix]] "[[wiktionary:inter-|inter-]]" ("''signifying among, between, amid, during, within, mutual, reciprocal'') and the adjective "[[wiktionary:montane#Adjective|montane]]" ("''inhabiting, or growing in [[mountainous]] [[region]]s, especially cool, moist [[Highland (geography)|upland]] slopes below the [[tree line|timberline]].''")   

The corresponding ''physiographic'' noun is [[wikt:intermountain|intermountain]], while the noun ''intermontane'' is an ''ecologic'' noun meaning ''among, between, amid, or within "[[wiktionary:montane#Noun|flora and fauna of a montane]] [[habitat]].''"  As an example, an [[Climate of the Alps|alpine region]] would be an intermontane for a species that migrates between a [[glacial]] region and a [[subalpine]] region.{{Specify|an actual example needs identified|date=January 2010}}

'''Land''', sometimes referred to as '''dry land''', is the solid surface of [[Earth]] that is not permanently covered by [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Allaby, Chris Park, ''A Dictionary of Environment and Conservation'' (2013), p. 239, {{ISBN|0199641668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support [[agriculture]], [[habitat]], and various [[natural resource]]s. Some life forms (including [[terrestrial plant]]s and [[terrestrial animal]]s) have developed from predecessor species that lived in [[body of water|bodies of water]].

Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called [[coast|coastal zones]]. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A [[maritime boundary]] is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock [[landform]]s are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.

== Etymology and terminology ==
{{original research section|date=March 2018}}
{{refimprovesect|date=March 2018}}

The word 'land' is derived from Middle English ''land'', ''lond'' and [[Old English]] ''land'', ''lond'' (“earth, land, soil, ground; defined piece of land, territory, realm, province, district; landed property; country (not town); ridge in a ploughed field”), from Proto-Germanic ''*landą'' (“land”), and from Proto-Indo-European ''*lendʰ-'' (“land, heath”). Cognate with Scots ''land'' (“land”), West Frisian ''lân'' (“land”), Dutch ''land'' (“land”), German ''Land'' (“land, country, state”), Swedish ''land'' (“land, country, shore, territory”), Icelandic ''land'' (“land”). Non-Germanic cognates include Old Irish ''lann'' (“heath”), Welsh ''llan'' (“enclosure”), Breton ''lann'' (“heath”), Old Church Slavonic ''lędо'' from Proto-Slavic ''*lenda'' (“heath, wasteland”) and Albanian ''lëndinë'' (“heath, grassland”) from ''lëndë'' (“matter, substance”).

A continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a "landmass". Although it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage "[[Land#Land mass|land mass]]"—the measure of land area—it is also used as two words. Landmasses include [[supercontinent]]s, [[continent]]s, and [[island]]s. There are four major continuous landmasses on [[Earth]]: [[Afro-Eurasia]], the [[Americas]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. Land, capable of being [[plough]]ed and used to grow [[crop]]s, is called [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} "arable, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A country or region may be referred to as the [[Homeland#Motherland|motherland]], [[fatherland]], or [[homeland]] of its people. Many countries and other places have names incorporating [[-land]] (e.g. [[New Zealand]]).

&lt;/ref&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] bodies occurred in tandem with the Sun.

== Land mass ==
{{Redirect|Landmass|the ambient album by Steve Roach|Landmass (album)}}
"Land mass" refers to the total [[surface area|surface]] [[area]] of the land of a geographical [[region]] or [[country]] (which may include discontinuous pieces of land such as [[island]]s). It is written as two words to distinguish it from the usage "landmass", the contiguous area of land surrounded by [[ocean]]. [[Earth]]'s total land mass is approximately {{convert|148,939,063.133|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is about 29.2% of its total surface. Water covers approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly in the form of [[ocean]]s and ice formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oceanicinstitute.org/aboutoceans/aquafacts.html|title=Aqua Facts|publisher=Hawai'i Pacific University Oceanic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural perspectives==
{{main article|Earth in culture}}
[[Creation myth]]s in many [[religion]]s recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural [[deity]] or deities, including accounts wherein the land is separated from the oceans and the air. The Earth itself has often been personified as a [[deity]], in particular a [[goddess]]. In many cultures, the [[mother goddess]] is also portrayed as a [[Fertility god|fertility deity]]. To the [[Aztec]]s, Earth was called ''[[Tonantzin]]''—"our mother"; to the [[Incas]], Earth was called ''[[Pachamama]]''—"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess [[Hou Tu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E.T.C. | last=Werner | year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. [[Bhumi Devi|Bhuma Devi]] is the goddess of Earth in [[Hinduism]], influenced by [[Graha]]. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth giantess [[Jörð]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]]. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian mythology]] is different from that of other cultures because Earth ([[Geb]]) is male and sky ([[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]) is female.

In the past, there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]]. The Jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one another. "Cosmology." Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012. Author: Giorgio Abetti, Astrophysical Observatory of Arcetri-Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Earth is usually described as a disk encircled by water. Cosmological and metaphysical speculations were not to be cultivated in public nor were they to be committed to writing. Rather, they were considered to be "secrets of the Torah not to be passed on to all and sundry" (Ketubot 112a). While study of God's creation was not prohibited, speculations about "what is above, what is beneath, what is before, and what is after" (Mishnah Hagigah: 2) were restricted to the intellectual elite. (Topic Overview: Judaism, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Ed. J. Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference, 2003. pp. 477–483. Hava Tirosh-Samuelson).&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}[[Image:Baylonianmaps.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Babylonian Map of the World|Imago Mundi]]'' Babylonian map, the oldest known world map, 6th century BC [[Babylonia]].]]

In early Egyptian&lt;ref&gt;H. and H.A. Frankfort, J.A. Wilson, and T. Jacobsen, Before Philosophy (Baltimore: Penguin, 1949) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian thought]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean. The Egyptian universe was pictured as a rectangular box with a north-south orientation and with a slightly concave surface, with Egypt in the center. A similar model is found in the [[Homeric]] account of the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods."&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Pyramid Texts]] and [[Coffin Texts]] reveal that the ancient Egyptians believed [[Nu (mythology)|Nun]] (the ocean) was a circular body surrounding ''nbwt'' (a term meaning "dry lands" or "islands"), and therefore believed in a similar Ancient Near Eastern circular Earth cosmography surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;''Pyramid Texts'', Utterance 366, 629a–629c: "Behold, thou art great and round like the Great Round; Behold, thou are bent around, and art round like the Circle which encircles the nbwt; Behold, thou art round and great like the Great Circle which sets."''(Faulkner 1969, 120)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', Pritchard, 1969, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Coffin Texts'', Spell 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early [[Greek philosophers]], a belief espoused by [[Pythagoras]]. Contrary to popular belief, most people in the [[Middle Ages]] did not believe the Earth was flat: this misconception is often called the "[[Myth of the Flat Earth]]". As evidenced by thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], the European belief in a [[spherical Earth]] was widespread by this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Jeffrey B. | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | title = The Myth of the Flat Earth | publisher = American Scientific Affiliation | accessdate = 2007-03-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EnVfVa?url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}; but see also [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to circumnavigation of the planet and the introduction of [[space flight]], belief in a spherical Earth was based on observations of the secondary effects of the Earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Extraterrestrial land==
Most planets known to humans are either gaseous [[Jovian planets]] or solid [[terrestrial planets]]. Terrestrial planets include [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Solar System Exploration [https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 Terrestrial Planet Interiors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105322/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian planets consist of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. While these planets are larger, their only land surface is a small rocky core surrounded by a large, thick atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf The Jovian Planets] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YLhNKGil?url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf |date=2015-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gas giant]]s, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to have surface layers composed of [[liquid hydrogen]] rather than solid land; however, their [[planetary geology]] is not well understood. The possibility of Uranus and Neptune (the [[ice giant]]s) possessing hot, highly compressed, supercritical water&lt;!-- {{efn|name=pressures}} --&gt; under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised.  While their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz et al. ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune,&lt;ref name="WiktorowiczIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiktorowicz|first1=Sloane J.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Andrew P.|title=Liquid water oceans in ice giants|journal=Icarus|volume=186|issue=2|year=2007|pages=436–447|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.09.003|arxiv = astro-ph/0609723 |bibcode = 2007Icar..186..436W }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.&lt;ref name="Silvera2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silvera|first1=Isaac|title=Diamond: Molten under pressure|journal=Nature Physics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2010|pages=9–10|issn=1745-2473|doi=10.1038/nphys1491|bibcode = 2010NatPh...6....9S |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:9121282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire surface of a rocky planet or moon is considered land, even with a lack of seas or oceans for contrast. Planetary bodies that have a thin atmosphere often have land that is marked by impact craters since atmospheric conditions would normally break-down incoming objects and erode rough impact sites.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/how-are-craters-formed/ How are craters formed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114424/http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/how-are-craters-formed/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land on planetary bodies other than Earth can also be bought and sold although ownership of [[extraterrestrial real estate]] is not recognized by any authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunarembassy.com|title=Lunar Embassy|work=lunarembassy.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407193257/http://lunarembassy.com/|archivedate=2015-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land and climate==
The land of the Earth interacts with and influences [[climate]] heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media"&gt;PBS Learning Media [http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ The Effect of Land Masses on Climate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092309/http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latitude]], [[elevation]], [[topography]], [[reflectivity]], and [[land use]] all have varying effects. The latitude of the land will influence how much [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface. High latitudes receive less solar radiation than low latitudes.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; The height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and [[precipitation]] on Earth. Large landforms, such as mountain ranges, divert wind energy and make the air parcel less dense and able to hold less heat.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; As air rises, this cooling effect causes [[condensation]] and [[precipitation]]. Reflectivity of the earth is called planetary [[albedo]] and the type of land cover that receives energy from the sun affects the amount of energy that is reflected or transferred to Earth.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"&gt;Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research [http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth/ The Climate Energy Balance of the Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305041546/http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth |date=2015-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vegetation]] has a relatively low albedo meaning that vegetated surfaces are good absorbers of the sun’s energy. [[Forests]] have an albedo of 10–15% while [[grasslands]] have an albedo of 15–20%. In comparison, sandy [[deserts]] have an albedo of 25–40%.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"/&gt; Land use by humans also plays a role in the regional and global climate. Densely populated cities are warmer and create [[urban heat islands]] that have effects on the precipitation, cloud cover, and temperature of the region.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">A '''land description'''  location of the written words which delineate a specific piece of [[real property]]. Also known as a "Legal Description". In the written transfer of real property, it is universally required that the instrument of conveyance ([[deed]]) include a written description of the property.

==Legal land description==
=== Canada ===
*In many parts of Canada the original subdivision of crown land was done by [[Township (Canada)|township]] surveys. Different sizes of townships have been used (e.g. Québec's irregularly shaped cantons and Ontario's concession townships), but all were designed to provide rectangular farm lots within a defined rural community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/history-of-cartography/#h3_jump_4 Canadian Encyclopedia, History of Cartography,Official Surveys:Cadastral Surveying], by L.M. Sebert&lt;/ref&gt; The survey of a township was essentially a subdivision survey, because the plan of the township was registered and the lots (sometimes called sections) were numbered. The description of a whole lot for legal purposes is complete in the identification of the township and the lot within the township.
* A legal land description in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta would be defined by the [[Dominion Land Survey]].  For example the village of Yarbo, [[Saskatchewan]] is located at the legal land description of SE-12-20-33-W1, which would be the South East [[Dominion Land Survey|quarter]] of [[Dominion Land Survey|Section]] 12, [[Township (Canada)|Township]] 20, [[Dominion Land Survey|Range]] 33, West of the first [[meridian (geography)|meridian]].
* A legal land description in British Columbia Fraser Valley Lower Mainland (Metro Vancouver) is defined by land surveys based out of New Westminster. Land in New Westminster Townsite corresponding to present day New Westminster is labelled as such while land outside the townsite is labelled as being in New Westminster District.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver, a Visual History, Bruce MacDonald, 1992, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Main subdivisions are [[District Lots]] that represent parcel sales to settlers mostly in the time from 1860-1890. District lots are numbered from DL1 to over DL3,000. These District Lots are still represented on the cadastral maps of British Columbia. Later these lots would be subdivided to form blocks and residential lots. A typical address would thus indicate a lot number, a block range, and the original District Lot from which it was subdivided.

'''Landscape limnology''' is the spatially explicit study of [[lake]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[wetland]]s as they interact with freshwater, terrestrial, and human [[landscape]]s to determine the effects of pattern on [[ecosystem]] processes across temporal and spatial scales. [[Limnology]] is the study of inland water bodies inclusive of rivers, lakes, and wetlands; landscape limnology seeks to integrate all of these ecosystem types.

The [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] component represents spatial hierarchies of landscape features that influence which materials, whether solutes or organisms, are transported to [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems; aquatic connections represent how these materials are transported; and human activities reflect features that influence how these materials are transported as well as their quantity and temporal dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.E. Webster, K.S. Cheruvelil and M.T. Bremigan. 2009. The lake landscape-context framework: linking aquatic connections, terrestrial features and human effects at multiple spatial scales. Verhandlungen Internationale Vereinigung für theoretische und angewandte Limnologie. 30:695-700&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==

The core principles or themes of [[landscape ecology]] provide the foundation for landscape limnology. These ideas can be synthesized into a set of four landscape ecology themes that are broadly applicable to any aquatic ecosystem type, and that consider the unique features of such ecosystems. 

'''A landscape limnology framework begins with the premise of Thienemann (1925). Wiens (2002):&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 2002. Riverine landscapes: taking landscape ecology into the water. Freshwater Biology 47:501-515&lt;/ref&gt; freshwater ecosystems can be considered patches.''' As such, the location of these patches and their placement relative to other elements of the landscape is important to the ecosystems and their processes. Therefore, the four main themes of landscape limnology are:

'''(1) Patch characteristics:''' The characteristics of a freshwater ecosystem include its physical morphometry, chemical, and biological features, as well as its boundaries. These boundaries are often more easily defined for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., shoreline, [[riparian zone]]s, and emergent vegetation zone) and are often a focal-point for important ecosystem processes linking terrestrial and aquatic components.

'''(2) Patch context:''' The freshwater ecosystem is embedded in a complex terrestrial mosaic (e.g., soils, geology, and land use/cover) that has been shown to drive many within-ecosystem features and processes such as water chemistry, species richness, and primary and secondary productivity. 

'''(3) Patch connectivity and directionality:''' The complex freshwater mosaic is connected to the particular patch of interest and defines the degree to which materials and organisms move across the landscape through freshwater connections. For freshwater ecosystems, these connections often display a strong directionality component that must be explicitly considered.&lt;ref&gt;Kling, G.W., G.W. Kipphut, M.M. Miller, and J. O’Briens. 2000. Integration of lakes and streams in a landscape perspective: the importance of material processing on spatial patterns and temporal coherence. Freshwater Biology 43: 477-497&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcarelli, A.M. and W.A. Wurtsbaugh. 2007. Effects of upstream lakes and nutrient limitation on periphytic biomass and nitrogen fixation in Oligotrophic, subalpine streams. Freshwater Biology 52:2211-2225&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a specific wetland can be connected through groundwater to other wetlands or lakes, or through surface water connections directly to lakes and rivers, or both, and the directionality of those connections will strongly impact the movement of nutrients and biota.

'''(4) Spatial scale and hierarchy:''' Interactions among terrestrial and freshwater elements occur at multiple spatial scales that must be considered hierarchically. The explicit integration of hierarchy into landscape limnology is important because (a) many freshwater ecosystems are hierarchically organized and controlled by processes that are hierarchically organized,&lt;ref&gt;Frissell, C.A., W.J. Liss, C.E. Warren &amp; M.D. Hurley. 1986. A hierarchical framework for stream habitat classification: viewing streams in a watershed context. Environmental Management 10: 199–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"&gt;Tonn, W.M. 1990. Climate change and fish communities: A conceptual framework. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 119:337-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poff, N.L. 1997. Landscape filters and species traits: towards mechanistic understanding and prediction in stream ecology. Journal of the North American Benthological Society 16: 391–409&lt;/ref&gt; (b) most freshwater ecosystems are managed at multiple spatial scales, from policy set at the national level, to land management conducted at local scales, and (c) the degree of homogeneity among freshwater ecosystems can change in relation to the scale of observation.

==Contributions to other fields==

Findings from landscape limnology research are contributing to many facets of aquatic ecosystem research, management, and conservation.  Landscape limnology is especially relevant for geographical areas with thousands of ecosystems (i.e. lake-rich regions of the world), in situations with a range of human disturbances, or when considering lakes, streams, and wetlands that are connected to other such ecosystems. For example, landscape limnology perspectives have contributed to the development of nutrient criteria for lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Soranno, P.A., K.S. Cheruvelil, R.J. Stevenson, S.L. Rollins, S.W. Holden, S. Heaton, and E.K. Torng. 2008. A framework for developing ecosystem-specific nutrient criteria: Integrating biological thresholds with predictive modeling. Limnology and Oceanography 53(2): 773-787&lt;/ref&gt; formation of classification systems that can be used to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Cheruvelil, K.S., P.A. Soranno, M.T. Bremigan, T. Wagner, and S.L. Martin. 2008. Grouping lakes for water quality assessment and monitoring: the roles of regionalization and spatial scale. Environmental Management. 41:425-440&lt;/ref&gt; understanding ecosystem responses to environmental stressors,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, L. A., A.T. Herlihy, P.R. Kaufmann, and J.M. Eilers. 1991. Acidic lakes and streams in the United States: The role of acidic deposition. Science (Wash.) 252: 1151-1154&lt;/ref&gt; or explaining biogeographic patterns of community composition.&lt;ref name="Tonn, W.M 1990"/&gt;

This is a list of many '''lists of countries and territories''' by various definitions, including FIFA countries, federations, and fictional countries. A [[country]] or territory is a geographical area, either in the sense of ''[[nation]]'' (a cultural entity) or ''[[Sovereign state|state]]''      (a political entity).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second Edition, with online updates as of September 2008. Entry "1. country"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{otheruses}}
The terms '''''location''''' and '''''place''''' in [[geography]] are used to identify a [[point (spatial)|point]] or an area on the [[Earth]]'s surface or elsewhere. The term ''location'' generally implies a higher degree of certainty than ''place'', the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of [[place identity]] and [[sense of place]] than on [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simandan |first=Dragos |date=April 2011 |title=Making sense of place through multiple memory systems|journal=New Zealand Geographer |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2011.01194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of location and place==
===Relative location===
A relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is "3 miles northwest of [[Seattle]]".

===Locality===
A [[locality (settlement)|location,]] settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary which is not well defined in varies by context. [[London]], for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as [[Covent Garden]] in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent.

===Absolute location===
An absolute location is designated using a specific pairing of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] grid — for example, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] or an ellipsoid-based system such as the [[World Geodetic System]] — or similar methods. For instance, the position of [[Lake Maracaibo]] in Venezuela can be expressed approximately in the [[WGS84]] coordinate system as the location 9.80°N (latitude), 71.56°W (longitude). It is, however, just one way. Alternative ways can be seen in this Geo Hack link: {{Coord|9.80|N|71.56|W|type:waterbody_region:VE}}.

''Absolute location'', however, is a term with little real meaning, since any location must be expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime Meridian]], a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through [[Greenwich, London]].  Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the [[Equator]]. Because latitude and longitude are expressed ''relative'' to these lines, a position expressed in latitude and longitude is actually a relative location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gersmehl |first=Philip |date=2008 |title=Teaching Geography |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |pages=60 |isbn=978-1-59385-715-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IslandInTheSky.JPG|thumb|250px|Ground-level view of mesas in the [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], known as the "Islands in the Sky"]]
[[File:Over Monument Valley, Navajo Nation.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of mesas in [[Monument Valley]], on the [[Colorado Plateau]]]]

'''''Mesa''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''[[table (furniture)|table]]'') is the [[American English]] term for [[Table (landform)|tableland]], an elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep [[cliff]]s. It takes its name from its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a [[Table (landform)|table hill]], table-topped hill or table mountain. It is larger than a [[butte]], which it otherwise resembles closely.

It is a characteristic [[landform]] of arid environments, particularly the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Southwestern United States]] in [[badlands]] and mountainous regions ranging from [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[California]] to the [[Dakotas]], [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]. Examples are also found in many other nations including [[Spain]], [[Sardinia]], North and [[South Africa]], [[Arabia]], [[India]], and [[Australia]].

[[Grand Mesa]] is a large mesa located in western [[Colorado]] in the Southwest United States. Cerro Negro is a mesa in [[Argentina]].

== Formation ==
[[File:HarQatum.jpg|thumb|right|Har Qatum, a mesa located on the southern edge of [[Makhtesh Ramon]], [[Israel]]]]

Mesas form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by [[tectonics|tectonic]] activity.  Variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and [[erosion]] cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Easterbrook |first= Don J. |title= Surface Processes and Landforms |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |location= Upper Saddle River, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include [[sandstone]], [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], [[basalt]], [[chert]], [[limestone]], [[lava|lava flows]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]].&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to weathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or [[caprock]], of a mesa. The less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of [[shale]], a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt;

The differences in strength of various rock layers is what gives mesas their distinctive shape. Less resistant rocks are eroded away on the surface into valleys, where they collect water drainage from the surrounding area, while the more resistant layers are left standing out.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; A large area of very resistant rock, such as a [[sill (geology)|sill]] may shield the layers below it from erosion while the softer rock surrounding it is eroded into valleys, thus forming a caprock.

Differences in rock type also reflect on the sides of a mesa, as instead of smooth slopes, the sides are broken into a staircase pattern called "cliff-and-bench topography".&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt; The more resistant layers form the cliffs, or stairsteps, while the less resistant layers form gentle slopes, or benches, between the cliffs. Cliffs retreat and are eventually cut off from the main cliff, or [[plateau]], by basal sapping. When the cliff edge does not retreat uniformly, but instead is indented by [[headward erosion|headward eroding]] streams, a section can be cut off from the main cliff, forming a mesa.&lt;ref name="Easterbrook"/&gt;

Basal sapping occurs as water flowing around the rock layers of the mesa erodes the underlying soft shale layers, either as [[surface runoff]] from the mesa top or from [[groundwater]] moving through permeable overlying layers, which leads to [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing and flowage of the shale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Choreley |first= Richard J. |author2=Stanley A. Schumm |author3=David E. Sugden|author-link3=David E. Sugden  |title= Geomorphology |year= 1985 |publisher= Methuen |location= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the underlying shale erodes away, it can no longer support the overlying cliff layers, which collapse and retreat. When the caprock has caved away to the point where only a little remains, it is known as a [[butte]].

[[File:PIA21585 - A Mesa in Noctis Labyrinthus.jpg|thumb|A mesa in [[Noctis Labyrinthus]] on [[Mars]], viewed by [[HiRISE]].]]
A transitional zone on [[Mars]], known as the ''fretted terrain'', lies between highly cratered highlands and less cratered lowlands. The younger lowland exhibits steep walled mesas and [[Mountain|knobs]]. The mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands. They are thought to form from ice-facilitated mass wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources. The mesas and knobs decrease in size with increasing distance from the highland escarpment. The relief of the mesas range from nearly 2&amp;nbsp;km to 100m depending on the distance they are from the escarpment.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David M.

{{Biodiversity}}
A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''[[Olfactory]] navigation''' is a hypothesis put forward to explain navigation and homing of [[pigeons]], in particular the [[homing pigeon]].

There are two principal versions. Papi’s mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home is not conclusive.

==Background==
[[Homing (biology)|Homing]] can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth’s surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar.  There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a [[compass]] sense (a sense of direction) and a [[map]] sense (a sense of location).  It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information.  It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. [[Homing (biology)#Magnetic orientation|Magnetic orientation]] as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des sciences de St. Pétersbourg |series=Series VI |volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier |first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal=Rev. phil. France Etranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiltschko|first=W.|author2=Wiltschko, R.|year=1996|title=Magnetic orientation in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=29–38 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/199/1/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = G | year = 1959 | title = Recent experiments on bird orientation | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1959.tb02396.x | journal = Ibis | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 399–416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that [[anosmic]] pigeons (''Columbia livia'') were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;  On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‘olfactory navigation’ was proposed.

==Olfactory map==
Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi’s ‘mosaic’ model&lt;ref name=papi90&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalè |first=P. |author2=Nozzolini, M. |author3=Papi, F.|year=1990|title=Homing pigeons do extract directional information from olfactory stimuli|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=26|pages=301–305|doi=10.1007/bf00171094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallraff’s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans G. Wallraff|title=Das Navigationssystem der Vögel: ein theoretischer Beitrag zur Analyse ungeklärter Orientierungsleistungen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7w1AAAAMAAJ|date=January 1974|publisher=R. Oldenbourg |location=München, Wien|isbn=978-3-486-39631-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘gradient’ model.  Papi’s mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental [[odours]], within a radius of 70-100 kilometres.&lt;ref name=good01&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=J.|year=2001|title=Perspectives on Animal Behaviour|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this information, it is possible to derive the ‘home’ direction when encountering these odours at a release site.  An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities.  It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights.  This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours.  Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues,&lt;ref name=hudson03&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=M.|year=2003|title=What evidence is there to support pigeons (''Columbia livia'') use an ‘olfactory map’ in order to home?|publisher=Sussex University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Papi (1990),&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey.

Wallraff’s gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means.  It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients.  The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity.  Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft.  This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration.  However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients.  Meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;Becker &amp; van Raden (1986). cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = R | year = 1996 | title = The Function of Olfactory Input in Pigeon Orientation: Does it Provide Navigational Information or Play Another Role? | url = | journal = J. Exp. Biol. | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 113–119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature.

==Empirical evidence==
The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the [[Dovecote|home loft]] with the directions from which they are carried by winds.  Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants.  The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.

Such an experiment was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;Papi F, Ioalé P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187–193&lt;/ref&gt; where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical [[Aviary|aviaries]] composed of bamboo.  Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine.  This was reversed for group two.  The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil.  Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south.  Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two.

However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures.&lt;ref name=able96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Able|first=K.P.|year=1996|title=The debate over olfactory navigation by homing pigeons |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, further experiments&lt;ref&gt;Baldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages. In: Schmidt-Koenig K, [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton WT]] (eds) Animal migration, navigation, and homing. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York, pp 78–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer|first1=J. |year=1978 |title=Pigeon homing: A repetition of the deflector loft experiment |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=393–395 |doi=10.1007/BF00303201 |jstor=4599182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"&gt;Waldvogel JA, Benvenuti S, Keeton WT, Papi F (1978) Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft. J Comp Physiol 128:297–301&lt;/ref&gt; applied two different methods – namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90°.  Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours.  Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90° error, known as the ‘deflector loft effect’.  The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site.

In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced,&lt;ref name="Waldvogel JA 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=J.|year=1979 |title=Pigeon homing: deprivation of olfactory information does not affect the deflector effect |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=11–22 |doi=10.1007/BF00293240}}&lt;/ref&gt; though when [[anosmic]] pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed.  Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect.  Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by “other non-odorous factors”, such as light reflection.&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt;&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Researchers support these suggestions&lt;ref&gt;Bang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational&lt;/ref&gt; by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons.  It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map.

Conflicting evidence, however, was produced&lt;ref name=papi90/&gt; when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of [[benzaldehyde]].  When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented.  Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction.

A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected.&lt;ref name=able96/&gt;  Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance.

==Other sensory cues==
The Earth’s magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth’s surface&lt;ref name=walcott96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walcott|first=C.|year=1996|title=Pigeon homing: observations, experiments and confusions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although [[William Tinsley Keeton|Keeton]] (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeton | first1 = W. T. | year = 1971 | title = Magnets interfere with pigeon homing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 102–106 | doi=10.1073/pnas.68.1.102 | pmid=5276278 | pmc=391171}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ioalé (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ioalé |first=P. |year=1984 |title=Magnets and pigeon orientation |journal=Monitore Zoologico Italiano |volume=18 |pages=347–358 |doi=10.1080/00269786.1984.10736466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wil96/&gt; did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast.  This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walcott | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = R. P. | year = 1974 | title = Orientation of homing pigeons altered by a change in the direction of the applied magnetic field | url = | journal = Science | volume = 184 | issue = | pages = 180–182 | doi=10.1126/science.184.4133.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Visalberghi | first1 = E. | last2 = Alleva | first2 = E. | year = 1979 | title = Magnetic influences on pigeon homing | url = | journal = Biologica Bulletino | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 246–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated [[magnetic coil|coils]].  Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current.  Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  In [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions.&lt;ref name=walcott96/&gt;

The predictable 15° movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass.  This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock.&lt;ref name=hudson03/&gt;  Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory [[European Starling|European starling]], indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun.&lt;ref name=good01/&gt;  This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt-Koenig |first=K. |year=1958 |title=Experimentelle Einflußnahme auf die 24-Stunden-Periodik bei Brieftauben und deren Auswirkung unterbesonderer Berücksichtigung des Heimfindevermögens |journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=15 |pages=301–331 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1958.tb00568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inconclusive evidence==
The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‘can they smell?’  Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions – yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Having the nerve to home: trigeminal magnetoreceptor versus olfactory mediation of homing in pigeons |year=2006 |first1=A. |last1=Gagliardo |first2=P. |last2=Ioale |first3=M.

In [[geodesy]], a '''reference ellipsoid''' is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the [[geoid]], the truer [[figure of the Earth]], or other planetary body.
Because of their relative simplicity, reference ellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which [[geodetic network]] computations are performed and point coordinates such as [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[elevation]] are defined.

In the context of standardization and geographic applications, a ''geodesic reference ellipsoid'' is the mathematical model used as foundation by [[Spatial reference system]] or [[Geodetic datum]] definitions.

== Ellipsoid parameters ==
In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] in which he included a proof&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Isaac Newton:''Principia'' Book III Proposition XIX Problem III, p. 407 in Andrew Motte translation, available on line at [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA239]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}} that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate [[ellipsoid]] of revolution which he termed an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] [[spheroid]]. Current practice&lt;ref name=torge&gt;Torge, W (2001) Geodesy (3rd edition), published by de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3-11-017072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flattening&gt;{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. |title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =University of Chicago Press|year=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7 | page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the word 'ellipsoid' alone in preference to the full term 'oblate ellipsoid of revolution' or the older term 'oblate spheroid'. In the rare instances (some [[asteroid]]s and [[planet]]s) where a more general ellipsoid shape is required as a model the term used is [[Triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial]] (or scalene) ellipsoid. A great many ellipsoids have been used with various sizes and centres but modern (post-[[GPS]]) ellipsoids are centred at the actual [[center of mass]] of the Earth or body being modeled.

The shape of an (oblate) ellipsoid (of revolution) is determined by the shape parameters of that [[ellipse]] which generates the ellipsoid when it is rotated about its minor axis. The [[semi-major axis]] of the ellipse, ''a'', is identified as the equatorial radius of the ellipsoid: the [[semi-minor axis]] of the ellipse, ''b'', is identified with the [[Geographic pole|polar]] distances (from the centre). These two lengths completely specify the shape of the ellipsoid but in practice geodesy publications classify reference ellipsoids by giving the semi-major axis and the ''inverse ''[[flattening]], {{sfrac|''f''}}, The flattening, ''f'', is simply a measure of how much the symmetry axis is compressed relative to the equatorial radius: 
:&lt;math&gt; f=\frac{a-b}{a}. &lt;/math&gt;
For the [[Earth]], ''f'' is around {{sfrac|300}} corresponding to a difference of the major and minor semi-axes of approximately {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}}. Some precise values are given in the table below and also in [[Figure of the Earth]]. For comparison, Earth's [[Moon]] is even less elliptical, with a flattening of less than {{sfrac|825}}, while [[Jupiter]] is visibly oblate at about {{sfrac|15}} and one of [[Saturn|Saturn's]] triaxial moons, [[Telesto (moon)|Telesto]], is nearly {{sfrac|3}} to {{sfrac|2}}.

A great many other parameters are used in [[geodesy]] but they can all be related to one or two of the set ''a'', ''b'' and ''f''. They are listed in [[ellipse]].

== Coordinates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|Latitude|Longitude}}
A primary use of reference ellipsoids is to serve as a basis for a coordinate system of [[latitude]] (north/south), [[longitude]] (east/west), and [[elevation]] (height).
For this purpose it is necessary to identify a ''zero [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'', which for Earth is usually the [[Prime Meridian]]. For other bodies a fixed surface feature is usually referenced, which for Mars is the meridian passing through the crater [[Airy-0]]. It is possible for many different coordinate systems to be defined upon the same reference ellipsoid.

The longitude measures the rotational [[angle]] between the zero meridian and the measured point. By convention for the Earth, Moon, and Sun it is expressed in degrees ranging from −180° to +180° For other bodies a range of 0° to 360° is used.

The latitude measures how close to the poles or equator a point is along a meridian, and is represented as an angle from −90° to +90°, where 0° is the equator. The common or ''geodetic latitude'' is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line that is [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference ellipsoid. Depending on the flattening, it may be slightly different from the ''geocentric (geographic) latitude'', which is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line from the center of the ellipsoid. For non-Earth bodies the terms ''planetographic'' and ''planetocentric'' are used instead.

The coordinates of a geodetic point are customarily stated as geodetic latitude and longitude, i.e., the direction in space of the geodetic normal containing the point, and the height ''h'' of the point over the reference ellipsoid. See [[geodetic system]] for more detail. If these coordinates, i.e., latitude ''ϕ'', longitude ''λ'' and height ''h'', are given, one can compute the ''geocentric rectangular coordinates'' of the point as follows:&lt;ref name="gps-chap10"&gt;{{cite book|title=GPS - theory and practice|author=B. Hofmann-Wellenhof, H. Lichtenegger, J. Collins|isbn=3-211-82839-7|page=282|others=Section 10.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\cos{\lambda} \\
Y &amp;= \big( N(\phi) + h\big)\cos{\phi}\sin{\lambda} \\
Z &amp;= \left( \frac{b^2}{a^2} N(\phi) + h\right)\sin{\phi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;N(\phi) = \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\phi + b^2\sin^2 \phi }},&lt;/math&gt;
and ''a'' and ''b'' are the equatorial radius ([[semi-major axis]]) and the polar radius ([[semi-minor axis]]), respectively. ''N'' is the ''[[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] in the [[prime vertical]]''.

In contrast, extracting ''φ'', ''λ'' and ''h'' from the rectangular coordinates usually requires [[Iterative method|iteration]]. A straightforward method is given in an [[OSGB]] publication&lt;ref name=osgb&gt;A guide to coordinate systems in Great Britain. This is available as a pdf document at

[http://mercator.myzen.co.uk/mercator.pdf The Mercator Projections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118224152/http://mercator.myzen.co.uk/mercator.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }} Section 5.4&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated methods are outlined in [[Geodetic system#From ECEF to geodetic|geodetic system]].

== Historical Earth ellipsoids ==
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
{{Main|Earth ellipsoid#Historical Earth ellipsoids}}
Currently the most common reference ellipsoid used, and that used in the context of the Global Positioning System, is the one defined by [[WGS 84]].

Traditional reference ellipsoids or ''[[geodetic datum]]s'' are defined regionally and therefore non-geocentric, e.g., [[ED50]]. Modern geodetic datums are established with
the aid of [[GPS]] and will therefore be geocentric, e.g., WGS 84.

== Ellipsoids for other planetary bodies ==
Reference ellipsoids are also useful for geodetic mapping of other planetary bodies including planets, their satellites, asteroids and comet nuclei. Some well observed bodies such as the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] now have quite precise reference ellipsoids.

For rigid-surface nearly-spherical bodies, which includes all the rocky planets and many moons, ellipsoids are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the mean surface height excluding any atmosphere. Mars is actually [[Oval (geometry)|egg shaped]], where its north and south polar radii differ by approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=in}}, however this difference is small enough that the average polar radius is used to define its ellipsoid. The Earth's Moon is effectively spherical, having almost no bulge at its equator. Where possible, a fixed observable surface feature is used when defining a reference meridian.

For gaseous planets like [[Jupiter]], an effective surface for an ellipsoid is chosen as the equal-pressure boundary of one [[Bar (unit)|bar]]. Since they have no permanent observable features, the choices of prime meridians are made according to mathematical rules.

Small moons, asteroids, and comet nuclei frequently have irregular shapes. For some of these, such as Jupiter's [[Io (moon)|Io]], a scalene (triaxial) ellipsoid is a better fit than the oblate spheroid. For highly irregular bodies, the concept of a reference ellipsoid may have no useful value, so sometimes a spherical reference is used instead and points identified by planetocentric latitude and longitude. Even that can be problematic for [[convex set|non-convex]] bodies, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], in that latitude and longitude don't always uniquely identify a single surface location.

'''Regrading''' is the process of [[Grading (engineering)|grading]] for raising and/or lowering the levels of land. Such a project can also be referred to as a '''regrade'''. 

Regrading may be done on a small scale (as in preparation of a house site)&lt;ref name=Ohio-tree&gt;[http://ohioline.osu.edu/b870/b870_6.html Trees and Home Construction: Minimizing the impact of construction activity on trees], University of Ohio Extension Bulletin 870-99. Accessed online 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or on quite a large scale (as in major reconfiguration of the terrain of a city, such as the [[Regrading in Seattle|Denny Regrade]] in [[Seattle]]).&lt;ref name=Denny-Crowley /&gt; 

Regrading is typically performed to make land more level (flatter), in which case it is sometimes called '''levelling'''.&lt;ref&gt;"Montana, McLaren Tailings", p.35 in [http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/ldr/mine/cercla.pdf CERCLA Imminent Hazard Mining and Mineral Processing Facilities], Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, February 1997. Accessed online 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) Levelling can have the consequence of making other nearby slopes steeper, and potentially unstable or prone to erosion.

==Purposes==
Reasons for regrading include:
* Enabling construction on lands that were previously too varied and/or steeply sloped.&lt;ref name=Ohio-tree /&gt;
* Enabling transportation along routes that were previously too varied and/or steep.&lt;ref name=Denny-Crowley /&gt;
* Changing drainage patterns and rerouting surface flow.&lt;ref name=Ohio-tree /&gt;
* Improving the stability of terrain adjacent to developments.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Puller, ''Deep Excavations: A Practical Manual'', Thomas Telford (1996). {{ISBN|0-7277-1987-4}}. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Potential problems and consequences from regrading include:
* Soil and/or [[Grade (slope)|slope]] instability
* Terrain prone to [[erosion]]
* [[ecology|Ecological]] impacts, [[habitat]] destruction, terrestrial and/or aquatic biological losses.&lt;ref name=Ohio-tree /&gt;
* Drainage problems (surface and/or subsurface flow) for areas not considered in the regrading plan.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Stone, [http://www.doityourself.com/stry/propertyregrading Adjacent Property Regrading Creates Drainage Problem for Homeowner], doityourself.com. Accessed online 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss of aesthetic [[natural landscape]] [[topography]] and/or historical [[cultural landscape]]s.

The size of ribbon farms can vary from lot to lot and from place to place.  In [[Illinois]], these lots could be {{convert|1/4|mi|m|-2}} or more long and only {{convert|30|–|40|ft|m|0}} wide.&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt;  Near [[Detroit]], the ribbon farms were about {{convert|250|ft|m|round=5}} wide and up to {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} long.&lt;ref name = "mich"&gt;{{citation|title = Michigan| author = David Lee Poremba | publisher = Interlink Books| year = 2006 |isbn = 1-56656-616-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vL-alUYZF4QC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| page =30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Texas]],  lots could be as small as {{convert|10|acre|0}} in area, or as large as {{convert|5|by|20|mi|km|0}}.&lt;ref name = "texas"/&gt;

Farmers of ribbon farms typically, although not universally, built houses on the farm along the river such that the houses on a series of ribbon farms were located near each other.

==History==
Ribbon or strip farms were prevalent in diverse areas of the world along rivers; locations where these farms appear include in parts of [[Ireland]],&lt;ref name = "irish"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards-Orpen |first=J. |year=1946 |title=Strip farms in the Graiguenamanagh basin |journal=Irish Geography |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=77–80 |doi=10.1080/00750774609555424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central Europe (particularly in [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]), West Africa, [[Hokkaido]], [[Brazil]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name = "texas"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Antecedents of the Long-Lot in Texas| author = Terry G.

Miller |publisher = The S. J. Clarke publishing company| year= 1922 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o5QUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page = 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of Louisiana.&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt;  Some sections of the American Southwest, particularly [[Texas]], also had ribbon farms laid out.&lt;ref name = "texas"/&gt;

It is likely that platting farms in ribbon lots arose independently in various parts of the world.  However, the ribbon farms scattered through the [[United States]] probably derive from the European model.&lt;ref name = "texas"/&gt;  The origin of the ribbon farm in Europe is unclear, but the first recorded appearance of these types of farms was in Germany in the ninth to eleventh century.&lt;ref name = "texas"/&gt;  These early German long lots were cut through forests or marshes, rather than along rivers, allowing for clustering of houses along a central road.&lt;ref name = "texas"/&gt;  From Germany, the pattern spread, notably to western [[France]], where forest, marsh, and river long lots were well-established by the time the French began colonizing the Americas.  By the 1630s, the long-lot pattern had been imported to the New World&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt; and established along the [[St Lawrence Seaway]] as the French [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]].  From there, the ribbon farm plan situated along rivers was carried to other parts of the French colonies, and diffused into some parts of the Spanish colonies.&lt;ref name ="texas"/&gt;

==Advantages==
In areas where rivers provided the main form of transportation, the ribbon farm layout gave multiple landowners access to the waterway.&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "seign"&gt;{{citation|title = The seigneurial system in early Canada: a geographical study, with a new preface|author = Richard Cole Harris |publisher = McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP| year = 1984|isbn = 0-7735-0434-6 | pages=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the long lots increased variation in soil and drainage within one lot,&lt;ref name = "seign"/&gt; and facilitated plowing by minimizing the number of times oxen teams needed to be turned.&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt;  Where farmers lived on their lots (rather than in a central village), the ribbon farm fostered communication and socialization, with houses clustered at the ends of the lots.&lt;ref name = "illinois"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "seign"/&gt;  The ribbon farm also strikes an economic balance, where houses are relatively close together and can be easily and economically accessed, yet the farmers need not spend excessive travel time to reach their fields some distance from a central village.&lt;ref name = "econ"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Economies of the Long-Lot Farm| author = C.

==Disadvantage==
One disadvantage was that the agricultural land of a single farmer was awkwardly spread out, often over two or more linear miles, necessitating a long travel time to reach rear parts of the lot.&lt;ref name = "seign"/&gt;  However, this disadvantage was generally no more than would have been experienced by peasant farmers living in a central village and walking to their fields.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Image:Rivinletto Light.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rivinletto Light]] on Kaasanmatala rock at the mouth of [[Kiiminkijoki]] in [[Haukipudas]], [[Finland]] is a typical sector light beacon.]][[Image:Leitfeuer_001.svg|thumb|Example of a sector light. The ship is navigating in the safe sector (white light is commonly marked as yellow in nautical charts).]]

A '''sector light''' is a man-made [[pilotage]] and [[position fixing]] aid that consists of strictly de-limited horizontal angle light beams to guide water-borne traffic through a safe channel at night in reasonable visibility. Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.

Sectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.

The colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]]:
* white - this sector is in the middle of the safe channel
* red - indicates the [[port (nautical)|port]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source
* green - indicates the [[starboard]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source.
A ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.

The world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is "red right returning".
[[File:Diego Garcia PEL.jpg|thumb|Diego Garcia PEL Sector Light. 3.5 million candela which is visible for over 18.5km by day. Total beam width of 1.6° with white sector of 0.2°.]]

== Example of a sector light ==
An example of a sector light is the light of the [[Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site|Fisgard Lighthouse]] in [[British Columbia]]. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.

Another example is the [[PEL sector light]] at [[Diego Garcia]]. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2003/March/diegogarcia.htm|title = US Navy Military Sealift Command|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vega.co.nz/price-list/gallery/case-study-diego-garcia/|title = PEL-6 Diego Garcia|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13&amp;nbsp;km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1276">'''Systematic Reconnaissance Flight''' (SRF) is a scientific method in [[wildlife]] survey for assessing the distribution and abundance of wild animals. It is widely used in Africa, Australia and North America for assessment of plains and woodland wildlife and other species.

The method involves systematic or random flight lines ([[transect]]s) over the target area at a constant height above ground, with at least one observer recording wildlife in a calibrated strip on at least one side of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Norton-Griffiths |year=1978 |url=http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/afesg/tools/ctganimen.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060507083157/http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/afesg/tools/ctganimen.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-07 |title=Counting Animals Second edition |publisher=[[African Wildlife Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method has been often criticised for low accuracy and precision, but is considered to be the best option for relatively inexpensive coverage of large game areas.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Jachmann, "Estimating Abundance of African Wildlife: An Aid to Adaptive Management", Springer Verlag (2001) {{ISBN|0-7923-7959-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theb1604 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Triangulation of [[Kodiak Island]] in 1929.]]

In [[surveying]], '''triangulation''' is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring only [[angle]]s to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline, rather than measuring distances to the point directly as in [[trilateration]]. The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles.

Triangulation can also refer to the accurate [[surveying]] of systems of very large triangles, called '''triangulation networks'''. This followed from the work of [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] in 1615–17, who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from ''three'' known points, but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points, a problem called [[Resection (orientation)|resectioning]]. Surveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to it. Such triangulation methods were used for accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of [[global navigation satellite system]]s in the 1980s.

== Distance to a point by measuring two fixed angles ==
[[Image:Triangulation-boat.png|thumb|310px|]]Triangulation may be used to find the position of the ship when the positions of A and B are known. An observer at ''A''  measures the [[angle]] ''α'', while the observer at ''B'' measures ''β'' .

The position of any vertex of a triangle can be calculated if the position of one side, and two angles, are known.  The following [[formulae]] are strictly correct only for a flat surface. If the curvature of the Earth must be allowed for, then   [[spherical trigonometry]] must be used.

=== Calculation ===
With ''l'' being the distance between ''A'' and ''B'' we have:
:&lt;math&gt; \ell = \frac{d}{\tan \alpha} + \frac{d}{\tan \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[trigonometric identities]] tan&amp;nbsp;α =&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;α and sin(α&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;β) =&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;β&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;β, this is equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\ell= d \left(\frac{\cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha} + \frac{\cos \beta}{\sin \beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = d\ \frac{ \sin(\alpha + \beta)}{\sin\alpha \sin\beta }&lt;/math&gt;
therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;d = \ell\ \frac{ \sin\alpha \sin\beta }{ \sin(\alpha + \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;

From this, it is easy to determine the distance of the unknown point from either observation point, its north/south and east/west offsets from the observation point, and finally its full coordinates.

[[Image:L-Triangulierung.png|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century triangulation network for the triangulation of Rhineland-Hesse]] 
Triangulation today is used for many purposes, including [[surveying]], [[navigation]], [[metrology]], [[astrometry]], [[binocular vision]], [[model rocketry]] and gun direction of [[weapon]]s.

In the field, triangulation methods were apparently not used by the Roman specialist land surveyors, the ''agromensores''; but were introduced into medieval Spain through [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arabic treatises]] on the [[astrolabe]], such as that by Ibn al-Saffar (d. 1035).&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1984), ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', London: Croom Helm &amp; La Salle, Illinois: Open Court. {{ISBN|0-87548-422-0}}. pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (d. 1048) also introduced triangulation techniques to [[Abu Rayhan Biruni#Geodesy and geography|measure the size of the Earth]] and the distances between various places.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified Roman techniques then seem to have co-existed with more sophisticated techniques used by professional surveyors.  But it was rare for such methods to be [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] (a manual on geometry, the eleventh century ''Geomatria incerti auctoris'' is a rare exception), and such techniques appear to have percolated only slowly into the rest of Europe.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;  Increased awareness and use of such techniques in Spain may be attested by the medieval [[Jacob's staff]], used specifically for measuring angles, which dates from about 1300; and the appearance of accurately surveyed coastlines in the [[Portolan charts]], the earliest of which that survives is dated 1296.

=== Gemma Frisius and triangulation for mapmaking ===
On land, the cartographer [[Gemma Frisius]] proposed using triangulation to accurately position far-away places for map-making in his 1533 pamphlet ''Libellus de Locorum describendorum ratione'' (''Booklet concerning a way of describing places''), which he bound in as an appendix in a new edition of [[Peter Apian]]'s best-selling 1524 ''Cosmographica''.  This became very influential, and the technique spread across Germany, Austria and the Netherlands.  The astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] applied the method in Scandinavia, completing a detailed triangulation in 1579 of the island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hven]], where his observatory was based, with reference to key landmarks on both sides of the [[Øresund]], producing an estate plan of the island in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jones (2004), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=_tsvf51Z4ocC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=portolan+triangulation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ZrtTrVrU11&amp;sig=iUMgeFF6fXDdfFStUWPLRyI5OOw&amp;hl=en Tycho Brahe, Cartography and Landscape in 16th Century Scandinavia]", in Hannes Palang (ed), European Rural Landscapes: Persistence and Change in a Globalising Environment, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;  In England Frisius's method was included in the growing number of books on surveying which appeared from the middle of the century onwards, including [[William Cuningham]]'s ''Cosmographical Glasse'' (1559), Valentine Leigh's ''Treatise of Measuring All Kinds of Lands'' (1562), [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]]'s ''Rules of Navigation'' (1571), [[Thomas Digges]]'s ''Geometrical Practise named Pantometria'' (1571), and [[John Norden]]'s ''Surveyor's Dialogue'' (1607). It has been suggested that [[Christopher Saxton]] may have used rough-and-ready triangulation to place features in his county maps of the 1570s; but others suppose that, having obtained rough bearings to features from key vantage points, he may have estimated the distances to them simply by guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Jean Norgate (2003), [http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/saxton1/sax1svy1.htm Saxton's Hampshire: Surveying], University of Portsmouth&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Willebrord Snell and modern triangulation networks ===
The modern systematic use of triangulation networks stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]], who in 1615 surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell underestimated the distance by 3.5%. The two towns were separated by one degree on the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], so from his measurement he was able to calculate a value for the circumference of the earth – a feat celebrated in the title of his book ''Eratosthenes Batavus'' (''The Dutch [[Eratosthenes]]''), published in 1617. Snell calculated how the planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[Snellius–Pothenot problem|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured much more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. This established the key idea of surveying a large-scale primary network of control points first, and then locating secondary subsidiary points later, within that primary network.

Snell's methods were taken up by [[Jean Picard]] who in 1669–70 surveyed one degree of latitude along the [[Paris Meridian]] using a chain of thirteen triangles stretching north from [[Paris]] to the clocktower of [[Sourdon]], near [[Amiens]]. Thanks to improvements in instruments and accuracy, Picard's is rated as the first reasonably accurate measurement of the radius of the earth. Over the next century this work was extended most notably by the Cassini family: between 1683 and 1718 [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Jean-Dominique Cassini]] and his son [[Jacques Cassini]] surveyed the whole of the Paris meridian from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Perpignan]]; and between 1733 and 1740 Jacques and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César Cassini]] undertook the first triangulation of the whole country, including a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles.

Triangulation methods were by now well established for local mapmaking, but it was only towards the end of the 18th century that other countries began to establish detailed triangulation network surveys to map whole countries. The [[Principal Triangulation of Great Britain]] was begun by the [[Ordnance Survey]] in 1783, though not completed until 1853; and the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India, which ultimately named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks, was begun in 1801. For the Napoleonic French state, the French triangulation was extended by [[Jean Joseph Tranchot]] into the German [[Rhineland]] from 1801, subsequently completed after 1815 by the Prussian general [[Karl von Müffling]]. Meanwhile, the famous mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] was entrusted from 1821 to 1825 with the triangulation of the [[kingdom of Hanover]], for which he developed the [[least squares|method of least squares]] to find the best fit solution for problems of large systems of [[simultaneous equation]]s given more real-world measurements than unknowns.

Today, large-scale triangulation networks for positioning have largely been superseded by the [[global navigation satellite system]]s established since the 1980s, but many of the control points for the earlier surveys still survive as valued historical features in the landscape, such as the concrete [[trig point|triangulation pillars]] set up for [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936–1962), or the triangulation points set up for the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (1816–1855), now scheduled as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].

'''UN/LOCODE''', the '''United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations''', is a [[geocode|geographic coding scheme]] developed and maintained by [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in [[trade]] and [[transport]] with functions such as [[port|seaports]], [[rail terminal|rail]] and road terminals, [[airport]]s, Postal Exchange Office and [[border crossing point]]s. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.&lt;ref name="Note 2011-1" /&gt;

==Structure==
UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two letters code a country by the table defined in [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid confusion with the letters "O" and "I" respectively.

For each country there can be a maximum of 17,576 entries using only letters (26×26×26), or 39,304 entries using letters and digits (34×34×34).

For the US, the letter combinations have almost all been exhausted. So in 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries with a digit as the last character.

==Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes==
For airports, the three letters following the [[country code]] are not always identical to the [[IATA airport code]]. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;

==Official UN/LOCODE tables==
UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an "issue". A discussion of the table's structure follows.

;Explanations:

* &lt;tt&gt;US NYC&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for New York City in the United States. Subdivision is the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:US]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is NYC. Coordinates: {{coord|40|42|N|074|00|W}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE BER&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Berlin (city) in Germany. Subdivision is the [[German state]] of Berlin (see [[ISO 3166-2:DE]]). Function: port, rail, road, airport, postal. IATA code is BER. Coordinates: {{coord|52|31|N|013|23|E}}.
*&lt;tt&gt;DE TXL&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Berlin-Tegel International Airport|Berlin-Tegel Airport]] in Germany. Function: airport. IATA code is TXL.
*&lt;tt&gt;FR PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for Paris (city) in France. Subdivision is the [[French department]] of Paris (see [[ISO 3166-2:FR]]). Function: port, rail, road, postal.
*&lt;tt&gt;GB PAR&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Par, Cornwall|Par]] in United Kingdom. Subdivision is the [[English county]] of [[Cornwall]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:GB]]). Function: port.
*&lt;tt&gt;SE GOT&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; for [[Göteborg]] (Goteborg without diacritics) in Sweden. Subdivision is the [[Swedish county]] of [[Västra Götaland]] (see [[ISO 3166-2:SE]]). Function: port, airport, postal. The IATA code of XWL indicated in the table is that of a train station in the city centre of [[Göteborg]] (though not the Central Station), while the IATA code for the main airport ([[Göteborg Landvetter Airport]]) is actually GOT. It also has a separate reference entry showing an alternate spelling of ''Gothenburg''.

===Data fields===
The fields are listed in the official order.

====Ch (Changes)====
:A change from the previous issue is indicated by one of the following characters in the first column:&lt;ref name="Note 2006-2" /&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marked for deletion in the next issue
: &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Change in location name (usually spelling)
: &lt;tt&gt;¦&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Other changes in the entry (not location)
: &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Entry added to the current issue
: &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Reference entry
: &lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp; Retained for certain entries in the USA code list ("controlled duplications")

====Locode====
:The code is represented with a space between the alpha-2 codes of ISO 3166-1 country code and the 3-character element.

====Name====
:Names of locations should be shown using the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet with, where appropriate, diacritic signs as contained in ISO 10646-1/1993 or ISO 8859-1/1987.

====Name Without Diacritics====
:The name of the location, but non-practicable Diacritics may be ignored and should not be converted into additional characters(e.g., Göteborg may be read as Goteborg,  rather than Goeteborg, Gothenburg, Gotembourg, etc.).
:Can contain an apostrophe, e.g. [[L'viv]]

====SubDiv (Subdivision)====
:The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1 to 3 character alphabetic and/or numeric code for the administrative division (state, province, department, etc.) of the country, as included in [[ISO 3166-2]]/1998. Only the latter part of the complete ISO 3166-2 code element (after the hyphen) is shown.

====Function====
:Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important are:
:* 1 = port (for any kind of waterborne transport)
:* 2 = rail terminal
:* 3 = road terminal
:* 4 = airport
:* 5 = postal exchange office
:* 6 = Inland Clearance Depot – ICD or "Dry Port", "Inland Clearance Terminal", etc.
:* 7 = fixed transport functions (e.g. oil platform)"; the classifier "7" is reserved for this function. Noting that the description "oil pipeline terminal" would be more relevant, and could be extended to cover also electric power lines and [[ropeway]] terminals.
:* B = Border crossing function
:* 0 = function not known, to be specified

====Status====
:Indicates the status of the entry by a 2-character code. The following codes are used at present:
:*AA: Approved by competent national government agency
:*AC: Approved by Customs Authority
:*AF: Approved by national facilitation body
:*AI: Code adopted by international organisation (IATA or ECLAC)
:*AM: Approved by the UN/LOCODE Maintenance Agency
:*AQ: Entry approved, functions not verified 
:*AS: Approved by national standardisation body
:*RL: Recognised location - Existence and representation of location name confirmed by check against nominated gazetteer or other reference work
:*RN: Request from credible national sources for locations in their own country
:*RQ: Request under consideration
:*UR: Entry included on user's request; not officially approved 
:*RR: Request rejected
:*QQ: Original entry not verified since date indicated
:*XX: Entry that will be removed from the next issue of UN/LOCODE

====Date====
:The date the location was added or updated: 0207 is July 2002, 9501 is January 1995, etc.
:Note that the edition published in 2008 uses the value 0701 for additions, while in other cases the exact month is used like 9710, 0212.

====IATA====
:For correlation purposes, the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for the location is marked if different from the second part of the UN/LOCODE.

====Coordinates====
:Some entries have coordinates in the database. They are represented as: ddmmN dddmmW, ddmmS dddmmE, etc.

====Remarks====
:The remarks column can among other things contain a hint to what specifically was changed (See data field - "Change").

==Availability==
Availability
UN/LOCODE is available on the [http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/welcome.html UNECE website], where the latest release of UNLOCOD directories and background documents are listed. Complete UN/LOCODE code list may be downloaded in the format of.mdb (MS Access database), .txt (text file) and .csv (Comma-separated values). HTML pages are also displayed on the website by countries.

==Data Maintenance Requests==
UN/LOCODE Data Maintenance Request system is web-based (http://apps.unece.org/unlocode/), which enables registered users to submit online requests for new UN/LOCODE entry modifications.

The system provides online functions for 
:*Registration of users and password retrieval 
:*Submission of requests for new UN/LOCODE entries 
:*Submission of requests for modification changes in existing UN/LOCODE entries 
:*A guide to explain the use of the system

==Errors==
In 2006-07 &lt;tt&gt;IQ IRB&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Irbil]] was added while &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Arbil]] with almost the same coordinates existed. In the 2007 edition &lt;tt&gt;IQ ABL&lt;/tt&gt; gets marked for deletion and &lt;tt&gt;IQ EBL&lt;/tt&gt; [[Erbil International Apt]] is added to the database, but with a different coordinates, reflecting the distance between airport and city. The error is to delete ABL and to insert IRB.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}}

Occasionally locations are listed twice; this is not necessarily an error. In issue 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSMC &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] (functions 2,3) was added while &lt;tt&gt;ARTUC &lt;/tt&gt; Tucumán (function 1) already was in the list. The coordinates are with very little deviation the same. Also in 2006-1, &lt;tt&gt;ARSSJ &lt;/tt&gt; [[San Salvador de Jujuy]] was added (function 4) while &lt;tt&gt;ARJUJ &lt;/tt&gt; Jujuy (functions 1,2,3,5) already existed.

=== 2009-1 ===
The 2009-1 release added several entries for Ukraine where the longitude is off by a few orders of magnitude. Ranging from 23230E to 38829E, they are outside what would constitute an eastern [[longitude]]. [[Ivano Frankovsk]] and [[Chuguyev]] have two entries now, along with Nikolayev. For all three, the [[Romanization|romanized]] spelling varies.

==Problems==
Some entries do not have coordinates, so it is not clear where they actually refer to. If an IATA code changes, then the UN/LOCODE could also be considered to have changed.

The '''United States Geological Survey Library''' ('''USGS Library''') is a program within the [[United States Geological Survey]], a scientific bureau within the [[United States Department of Interior|Department of Interior]] of the [[United States government]]. The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] operates as a fact-finding research organization with no regulatory responsibility.

The [http://library.usgs.gov/ USGS Library] has major branches in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] ([[Denver Federal Center]]), and [[Menlo Park, California]] and smaller, focused research libraries in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

==Description==

The libraries in Reston and Menlo Park have been designated as official Federal Government Depositories providing public access to selected U.S. Government publications.

==U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System==
The newly revised classification system presented in this report is designed for use in the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Library and other earth science libraries. Prior to the administration of Fred Boughton Weeks, 1903-1908, the library lacked a classification scheme. The Dewey Decimal system for geologic material was not sufficiently developed to accommodate the range of specialized material collected at the USGS Library, and The [[Library of Congress Classification]] System had not yet been published. The library staff and patrons were concerned about continued development of the collection without an acceptable classification scheme.
Mr. Weeks and bibliographer John M. Nickles of the library staff, with the assistance of three
consultants from the New York Public Library, developed the USGS classification system designed specifically for an earth science library.
The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science
libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers.
The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Sasscer, R. Scott. 1992, 2000. "U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System." U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2010. Revised June 2000. Published in the Eastern Region, Reston, Va.

==Special Library Collections==

===Field Records Collection — Denver, Colorado===
The [http://www.cr.usgs.gov/fieldrecords/ Field Records Collection] is an archive of unpublished field notes, correspondence, manuscripts, maps, analysis reports and other data created or collected by USGS geologists during field studies and other project work. The majority of the collection dates from 1879 and relates to work done in the contiguous United States. Materials in the collection represent almost 130 years of scientific investigations by the USGS, from the earliest days of the agency to recently completed projects. Records contributed by approximately 1,200 USGS scientists are presently archived. Located in the Central Region Library in Denver, Colorado, the collection is available for on-premises examination during normal library hours.
Field records and project archives on [[Alaska]] are kept in the Alaska Technical Data Unit Field Records Archive.

===Rare Books and Maps===
The Rare Book Collection of the USGS Library comprises unusual publications, rare books, and maps collected since 1879. Included are historical maps and publications of the Survey, as well as early publications of many federal, state and other geological surveys. Records of select geological societies are also maintained in the collection, such as the [[Geological Society of Washington]], which was founded by [[John Wesley Powell]] and other noted scientists after the Civil War. Of special note are many 19th century maps with topics such as American political boundaries, transportation, geology, and mining.

===Desnoyers Collection===
At an auction in Paris, France, pieces of M. [[Jules Desnoyers]]'s (1800–1887) library were purchased in 1885 by the USGS Library to start the foreign country collection. M. Desnoyers was a founder and later Secretary of the [[Société Géologique de France]], and in 1834 he was appointed librarian of the [[Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris.

===William R. Halliday Collection===
William R. Halliday, M.D. (b. 1926), joined the [[National Speleological Society]] in 1947. By the late 1950s he was director of the [[Western Speleological Survey]]. His works include Adventure Is Underground (1959), Caves of California (1962), Caves of Washington (1963), Depths of the Earth (1966), Caves and Cavers of the United States (1966), American Caves and Caving (1974), Discovery and Exploration of the Oregon Caves: [[Oregon Caves National Monument]] (with [[Frank K. Walsh]]; 1976) and, [[Floyd Collins]] of Sand Cave: A Photographic Memorial (1998). He donated his private collection of rare and out-of-print books and pamphlets on caves, caving and speleology to the USGS Library in 2000.

Dr. Halliday has also donated several collections of private papers, correspondence and research to the [[University of Washington]] Library and to the [[J. Willard Marriott Library]] of the [[University of Utah]].

===Kunz Collection===
In 1933, the Library acquired the [[George F. Kunz]] collection for $1.00 from the estate of the former USGS employee and Vice-President of [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]  The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection on gems and minerals including rare books on gemology, the folklore of gemstones through history, lapidary arts and archival gem trade records important to the provenance of named stones such as the "[[Hope Diamond]]." Kunz was a former USGS employee, a vice-president of Tiffany &amp; Co., and one of the world's preeminent gem experts. The collection was acquired through the genroisty of Dr. Kunz's heirs, Mrs. [[Opal Kunz]] and Mrs. [[Hans Zinsser]]. Mr. Walter E. Reid, mining consultant and strong friend of the library, was largely instrumental in securing the Kunz collection.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection of many rare books, pamphlets, and other unique materials on the acquisition, collecting and lore of jewels and precious stones. Acquired by the US Geological Survey Library in 1933 after the death of George F. Kunz, a noted mineralogist and vice-president of the Tiffany &amp; Co. of New York, the Kunz Collection today is fairly unknown outside of a small circle of gemologists, historians, and art collectors. In this paper, a short biography of George F. Kunz is given, as well as a description of the contents and scope of his collection held in the USGS Library. Some examples of the unique materials held in the collection are shown. How the Kunz Collection is used by library patrons and museums is also discussed. Appended to the paper is a bibliography of the works by and about Dr. Kunz."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://rock.geosociety.org/absindex/annual/1999/50292.htm "George F. Kunz Collection."] Denver, Colorado: Geoscience Information Society, 34th annual meeting, 1999. Includes bibliographic references (p. 142-146). Paper presented to the Geological Society of America Annual Convention in Denver, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map Collection===
The library's map collections have provided invaluable aid to authorities and scientists in times of crisis (the California Northridge earthquake in 1994 and major fires in the nation's forests). Topographic maps have also been used for genealogy research to pinpoint where ancestors lived, locate forgotten cemeteries, provide information on boundary changes, and research natural and man-made changes to areas over time. Planners have used the foreign map collections to study foreign terrain, geologic conditions and natural resources. During WWII, The [[New York Times]] (June 11, 1944) reported "A 'Commando' raid by a group of civilian scientists, a search through obscure seventeenth century French manuscripts, months of study of geological reports, experiments with model beaches – all these were part of the Allied preparations for the invasion of Normandy … The dramatic story of the preparations, which began in … libraries, shifted to laboratories and ended on the shell-swept beaches …". The collections were consulted for the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Library maps have provided aid in international disaster areas such as the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and volcanoes worldwide. A brief mention of a diamond found in the 1906 annual report of the USGS began a trail of research and investigation that led one geologist to prospect for diamonds in Canada.

===Topographic Map Archive===
Responsibility for the Topographic Map Archive was formally transferred to the USGS Library in Reston, Virginia, in March 2003. The Archive includes each U.S. state and territory, in all scales, editions and various printings. With coverage dating from the 1880s when the USGS began publishing standard topographic quadrangles; the Archive is the most complete collection of USGS topographic maps.

===Heringen Collection===
The Heringen Collection, is a group of military texts and maps, looted by the Nazis from European libraries, universities, geological societies, private businesses, homes and offices. Hidden in a potash mine in [[Heringen]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]], they were transported by the U.S. military at the end of WWII as captured war materials. Some 23,000 reports, books and maps were accepted by the USGS Library and integrated into the main collection. The materials are consulted for research ranging from European road development, water resources use or mining and construction. In 1946, the Heringen Collection was transferred from the U.S. Geological Survey's [[Military Geology Unit]] to the Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "The Heringen Collection." Information Bulletin. Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML). Volume 40 (1), November 2008. {{ISSN|0049-7282}}. Page 15.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in journal, Earth Sciences History, the author says that the results of the German theft of Russian maps influenced the way they made maps for the next two generations. "The Heringen Collection at the US Geological Survey is a special collection of maps, books and reports stolen by units of the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) as they invaded and occupied countries during World War II. The materials in the Collection came from private, society and public library collections, and were used by military geologists in each German army to help protect its soldiers, to advance their invasion, and to consolidate their occupation. They used the maps of the occupied countries against their peoples. For a generation after the invasion of the Soviet Union, this influenced the way Russian maps were drawn and printed."&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA496551  "The Heringen Collection of the US Geological Survey Library of Reston, Virginia."] Earth Sciences History, Volume 27, Number 2. Page 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Antarctic Resource Center===
The U.S. Antarctic Resource Center (USARC) in Reston, Virginia, is our Nation's depository for [[Antarctic]] maps, charts, geodetic ground control, satellite images, aerial photographs, publications, slides, and video tapes. These resources are produced by [[Antarctic Treaty]] nations in support of their activities in Antarctica and provided to the USARC in compliance with a standing resolution of the treaty providing for exchange of information. The USGS maintains these materials through an interagency cooperative agreement with the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), which also supports the USGS Antarctic Mapping Program.

===USGS Photographic Collection===
The [http://libraryphoto.cr.usgs.gov Photographic Library] is an archive of still photographs and original sketches dating from the 1870s and taken by USGS scientists as part of their field studies. Topics include USGS personnel, earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena, historical mining operations, and earth science photographs. The works of pioneer photographers such as [[William Henry Jackson]], [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], [[Carleton Watkins]], [[John Karl Hillers]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[Andrew J. Russell]], [[E. O. Beaman]] and [[William Bell (photographer)]] are represented in the collection. Some photographs have been used to illustrate publications, but most have never been published.

==History==
Congress authorized a Library for the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) in 1879. The library was formally established in 1882, with the naming of the first librarian, Charles C. Darwin, and began with a staff of 3 and a collection of 1,400 books. The Act of Congress establishing the USGS authorized the creation of a program for exchanging copies of USGS reports for publications of state, national, and international organizations. The exchange program was modeled after a program used by Dr. [[Ferdinand V. Hayden]] when he was head of the Interior Department's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories (1867–1879). The U.S. Geological Survey Library inherited 1,000 volumes of serials from Dr. Hayden's former exchange program, which he had based on the program begun by the Smithsonian Institution in 1846.
After Dr. Hayden died in 1887, his widow donated his personal collection to the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Other early gifts were made by Major [[John Wesley Powell]], second Director of the US Geological Survey, who donated his collection of State Geological Survey reports and the family of Dr. [[Isaac Lea]] (Philadelphia publisher and gem collector whose family donated nearly 600 items of his personal library). Dr. William Halliday, a world-renowned speleologist began donating his cave collection in 2003.

In a review of the USGS Library operations in 1937, William Heers, the Chief Librarian, noted that the library had more than 200,000 books and reports, about 60,000 pamphlets, and also about 60,000 maps, most of these obtained by gift and exchange. Fully half of those researchers who used the library were outside of the US Geological Survey. In service to those outside the government, between 8-10,000 books were loaned out each year through [[interlibrary loan]]s, both within the continental US and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Heers, William H. 1937. "The U.S. Geological Survey Library." The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the USGS Library during its centennial, it was noted that in 1978 the library had acquired nearly 116,000 new items. About 75% of these were journals, of which 10,000 serial, magazine, and other periodical titles were received. In 1978, the library also circulated 105,000 items, made 17,700 [[interlibrary loan]]s and answered some 27,000 requests for information.&lt;ref&gt;"Books, Maps..." Geotimes. March 1979. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the USGS Library joined the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/general_pages/2012BHLMembership.pdf Press Release: Biodiversity Heritage Library Adds Two Partners. Smithsonian Libraries. March 5, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of contributing important historical works related to taxonomy as well as relevant USGS publications.

The U.S. Geological Survey Library system has become the largest earth science library in the world. Materials within the library system include books and maps dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Other materials include a nearly complete set of the various State Geological Survey publications and a virtually complete set of USGS topographic maps.
The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with domestic and international scientific organizations.

In [[robotics]] and [[computer vision]], '''visual odometry''' is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of robotic applications, such as on the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s.&lt;ref name=Maimone2007&gt;{{cite journal

==Overview==
In [[navigation]], [[odometry]] is the use of data from the movement of actuators to estimate change in position over time through devices such as [[rotary encoder]]s to measure wheel rotations. While useful for many wheeled or tracked vehicles, traditional odometry techniques cannot be applied to [[mobile robot]]s with non-standard locomotion methods, such as legged robots. In addition, odometry universally suffers from precision problems, since wheels tend to slip and slide on the floor creating a non-uniform distance traveled as compared to the wheel rotations. The error is compounded when the vehicle operates on non-smooth surfaces. Odometry readings become increasingly unreliable as these errors accumulate and compound over time.

Visual odometry is the process of determining equivalent odometry information using sequential camera images to estimate the distance traveled. Visual odometry allows for enhanced navigational accuracy in robots or vehicles using any type of locomotion on any surface.

==Types==
There are various types of VO.

===Monocular and Stereo===
Depend on the camera setup, VO can be categorized as Monocular VO (single camera), Stereo VO (two camera in stereo setup).

[[File:VIO sensor in various commercial quadcopters .jpg|thumb|VIO is widely used in commercial quadcopters, which provide localization in GPS denied situations]]

===Feature Based and Direct Method===
Traditional VO's visual information is obtained by Feature Based Method, which extract image feature points and tracking them in the image sequence. Recent development in VO research provided an alternative, called Direct Method, which uses pixel intensity in the image sequence directly as visual input. There are also hybrid methods.

===Visual Inertial Odometry===
If an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) is used within the VO system, it is commonly referred to as Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).

==Algorithm==
Most existing approaches to visual odometry are based on the following stages.

===Overview===
The goal of estimating the egomotion of a camera is to determine the 3D motion of that camera within the environment using a sequence of images taken by the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian, T. |author2=Tomasi, C. |author3=Heeger, D. |title=Comparison of Approaches to Egomotion Computation |url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/~tomasi/papers/tian/tianCvpr96.pdf |journal=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |pages=315 |year=1996 |accessdate=7 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808123021/http://www.cs.duke.edu/%7Etomasi/papers/tian/tianCvpr96.pdf |archivedate=August 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of estimating a camera's motion within an environment involves the use of visual odometry techniques on a sequence of images captured by the moving camera.&lt;ref name="milella" /&gt; This is typically done using [[feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection]] to construct an [[optical flow]] from two image frames in a sequence&lt;ref name="irani" /&gt; generated from either single cameras or stereo cameras.&lt;ref name="milella"&gt;{{cite journal

Features are detected in the first frame, and then matched in the second frame. This information is then used to make the optical flow field for the detected features in those two images. The optical flow field illustrates how features diverge from a single point, the ''focus of expansion''. The focus of expansion can be detected from the optical flow field, indicating the direction of the motion of the camera, and thus providing an estimate of the camera motion.

There are other methods of extracting egomotion information from images as well, including a method that avoids feature detection and optical flow fields and directly uses the image intensities.&lt;ref name="irani" /&gt;
