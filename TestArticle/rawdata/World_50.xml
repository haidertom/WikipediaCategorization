'''Africa''' is the world's second largest and second most-populous [[continent]] (behind [[Asia]] in both categories). At about 30.3 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (11.7 million square&amp;nbsp;miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of [[Earth|Earth's]] total surface area and 20% of its land area.&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;Sayre, April Pulley (1999), ''Africa'', Twenty-First Century Books. {{ISBN|0-7613-1367-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With
{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Africa}}|R}}/1e9 round 1}} billion people{{UN_Population|ref}} as of {{UN_Population|Year}}, it accounts for about 16% of the world's [[human population]]. The continent is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Isthmus of Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Indian Ocean]] to the southeast and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The continent includes [[Madagascar]] and various [[archipelagos]]. It contains 54 [[diplomatic recognition|fully recognised]] [[sovereign states]] ([[country|countries]]), nine [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]] and two ''[[de facto]]'' independent [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited or no recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa]].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the continent and its countries are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], with a substantial portion and number of countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Africa hosts a large diversity of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|ethnicities]], cultures and [[Languages of Africa|languages]]. In the [[New Imperialism|late 19th century]], European countries [[Scramble for Africa|colonised almost all of Africa]]; most present states in Africa originated from a process of [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] in the 20th century. African nations cooperate through the establishment of the [[African Union]], which is headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Palazzo Ferreria statue 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Statue representing Africa at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern Africa to the west of the [[Nile]] river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich |encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch |date=1913–1918 |location=Hannover|edition=8th |url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015 |language=German|title=Afri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name seems to have originally referred to a [[Ancient Libya|native Libyan]] tribe, an ancestor of modern [[Berbers]]; see [[Terence#Biography|Terence]] for discussion. The name had usually been connected with the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''{{lang|phn|ʿafar}}'' meaning "dust",&lt;ref&gt;Venter &amp; Neuland, ''NEPAD and the African Renaissance'' (2005), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] word ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name="Michell"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, "The Berbers"], ''Journal of the Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161–94.&lt;/ref&gt; The same word&lt;ref name=Michell/&gt; may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a Berber tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. {{ISBN|90-429-1344-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, [[Carthage]] became the capital of the province it then named ''[[Africa Proconsularis]]'', following its defeat of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] in the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BC, which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix ''[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]'' can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Gallia Celtica|Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim region of [[Ifriqiya]], following its conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman)]] Empire's ''[[Exarchate of Africa|Exarchatus Africae]]'', also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in his 7th-century ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title=Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michèle Fruyt in 1976 proposed&lt;ref&gt;in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221–38.&lt;/ref&gt; linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] in 1984 proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East." Robert R. Stieglitz. ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (September 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ibn Khallikan]] and some other historians claim that the name of Africa came from a [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarite]] king called Afrikin ibn Kais ibn Saifi also called "Afrikus son of Abrahah" who subdued Ifriqiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cdLAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|title=Kitab Wafayat Ala'yan.

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9–3.0&amp;nbsp;million years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C.

After the evolution of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' approximately 150,000 to 100,000 years BP in Africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan van Sertima|van Sertima, Ivan]].

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Candice Goucher|author2=Linda Walton|title=World History: Journeys from Past to Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7cAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-72354-6|pages=2–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the [[Sahara]] has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Keenan|title=The Sahara: Past, Present and Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUKPAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-97001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ice age]]s, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[Saharan rock art|rock art paintings]] depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] dating back perhaps 10 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercier|first1=Norbert|author2=et. al.|date=2012|title=OSL dating of quaternary deposits associated with the parietal art of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau (Central Sahara)|journal=Quaternary Geochronology|volume=10|pages=367–73|doi=10.1016/j.quageo.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht "Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060153/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht |date=2014-03-07 }}, ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, "Africa, 3rd Ed."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011083356/http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm |date=2007-10-11 }} Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt;

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. The first [[Roman emperor]] native to North Africa was [[Septimius Severus]], born in [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day Libya—his mother was Italian Roman and his father was [[Punics|Punic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New exhibition about Roman Emperor Septimius Severus at the Yorkshire Museum|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/features/features/8826893.New_exhibition_about_Roman_Emperor_Septimius_Severus_at_the_Yorkshire_Museum/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Press|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic centre of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]].

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift.

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt;was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. The Berlin Conference sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucien Bély|title=The History of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118|year=2001|publisher=Editions Jean-paul Gisserot|isbn=978-2-87747-563-1|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]] followed suit the next year (March 1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Aryeetey|author2=Jane Harrigan|author3=Machiko Nissanke|title=Economic Reforms in Ghana: The Miracle and the Mirage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87V55ZHppSYC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2000|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=978-0-86543-844-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be granted independence. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===

Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human migration|Migration]] from African nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At Least a Million Sub-Saharan Africans Moved to Europe Since 2010 |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2018/03/22/at-least-a-million-sub-saharan-africans-moved-to-europe-since-2010/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Plate is a major [[tectonic plate]] straddling the [[equator]] as well as the [[prime meridian]]. It includes much of the [[continent]] of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between {{Mya|60}} and {{Mya|10}}, the [[Somali Plate]] began [[rift (geology)|rifting]] from the African Plate along the [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Geologically, Africa includes the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iran and the [[Anatolian Plateau]] of Turkey mark where the [[African Plate]] collided with Eurasia. The [[Afrotropic ecozone]] and the [[Saharo-Arabian Region|Saharo-Arabian desert]] to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[language family]] unites the north linguistically.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html "Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105193432/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html |date=2012-01-05 }} [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}
[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Mauritius beach.png|thumb|Tropical beach in [[Trou-aux-Biches]], [[Mauritius]]]]
Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity and [[arable land]]. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name="environmentalatlas"/&gt;

[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level – UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206051452/http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 |date=December 6, 2008 }}.

==Politics==
{{See also|List of political parties in Africa by country}}
There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

=== The African Union ===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Member states of the African Union&lt;!--no suspended states--&gt;]]

{{Main|African Union}}

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 55-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name="African Union 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm |title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki |author=Thabo Mbeki |date=9 July 2002 |publisher=africa-union.org |location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa |accessdate=8 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210549/http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_%26_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union%2C%209%20July%202002.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/|title=Human Development Reports – United Nations Development Programme|website=hdr.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in Africa|Poverty]], illiteracy, [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty ($1.25 per day); some 50% of [[Poverty in Africa|the population living in poverty]] in 1981 (200 million people), a figure that rose to 58% in 1996 before dropping to 50% in 2005 (380 million people).

Africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in Sub-Saharan African countries.  The last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme (HIPC).  The HIPC resulted in some positive and negative effects on the economy in Africa.  About ten years after the 2005 debt crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa was resolved, Zambia fell back into dept.  A small reason was due to the fall in copper prices in 2011, but the bigger reason was that a large amount of the money Zambia borrowed was wasted or pocketed by the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/15/zambias-looming-debt-crisis-is-a-warning-for-the-rest-of-africa|title=Zambia’s looming debt crisis is a warning for the rest of Africa|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In a recently published analysis based on [[World Values Survey]] data, the Austrian political scientist [[Arno Tausch]] maintained that several African countries, most notably [[Ghana]], perform quite well on scales of mass support for [[democracy]] and the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3214715 |ssrn=3214715|title=Africa on the Maps of Global Values: Comparative Analyses, Based on Recent World Values Survey Data|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|date=2018-07-16|last1=Tausch|first1=Arno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch's global value comparison based on the [[World Values Survey]] derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. The non-violent and law-abiding society 2. Democracy movement 3. Climate of personal non-violence 4. Trust in institutions 5. Happiness, good health 6. No redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. Accepting the market 8. Feminism 9. Involvement in politics 10. Optimism and engagement 11. No welfare mentality, acceptancy of the Calvinist work ethics. The spread in the performance of African countries with complete data, Tausch concluded “is really amazing”. While one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in [[Ghana]], the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]], and especially for Africa's leading economy, [[South Africa]]. High [[Human Inequality]], as measured by the [[UNDP]]’s [[Human Development Report]]’s [[Index of Human Inequality]], further impairs the development of [[Human Security]]. Tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and [[human rights]] data, emerging from Africa, is reflected in the development of a [[civil society]].

In recent years, the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 Malia Politzer, "China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration"], ''Migration Information Source''.

A Harvard University study led by professor [[Calestous Juma]] showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. "African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124337.htm "Africa Can Feed Itself in a Generation, Experts Say"], ''[[Science Daily]]'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new programme named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

[[File:Kobli1.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from [[Benin]]]]
Africa's population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. In some African states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overpopulation.org/Africa.html|title=Africa Population Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of people in Africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx Past and future population of Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924044751/http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj_africa.aspx |date=2015-09-24 }}.

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and [[southeast Africa]]. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[the Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''. PUQ. p. 204. {{ISBN|2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ("[[Bushmen|San"]] or "Bushmen") and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

Prior to the [[decolonization]] movements of the post-[[World War II]] era, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] were represented in every part of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country" (3 of 10)]. ''Time'', 5 November 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Decolonization during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million ''[[pieds-noir]]s'' in North Africa),&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994).

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name="Africa"/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, "Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce"], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Africa |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=1 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602050234/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D8048%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate= 2 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger-Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of number of languages, it is the largest language family in Africa and perhaps the largest in the world.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 400,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khoisan Languages|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Khoisan.html|website=The Language Gulper|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, English and French (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and Spanish are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. Italian is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. German is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former German protectorate.

Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"&gt;[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf Pearsonhighered.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501070358/http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/&gt;

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[architecture of Africa|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known [[bead]]s were made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology'' (2013, {{ISBN|0191626147}}), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Africa}}
[[File:Ke-Nako Music-Performance Vienna2008c.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A musician from [[South Africa]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab world|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
[[File:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Fifty-four African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

They noted that raw food eaten by the patient may have been contaminated by rats. In 1955, Mackerass and Sanders identified the lifecycle of the worm in rats, defining snails and slugs as the intermediate hosts and noting the path of transmission through the blood, brain, and lungs in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
Following World War II, ''A. cantonensis'' spread throughout Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Islands, including [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Cases were soon reported in [[New Caledonia]], the [[Philippines]],  [[Rarotonga]], [[Saipan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the 1960s, even more cases were reported from the region from locations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Java]], [[Thailand]], [[Sarawak]], [[Vietnam]], and the New Hebrides ([[Vanuatu]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|title=EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS|last=|first=|date=2018-03-09|website=louisiana.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study of eosinophilic meningitis in humans was conducted by Rosen, Laigret, and Bories, who hypothesized that the parasite causing these infections was carried by fish. However, Alicata noted that raw fish was consumed by large numbers of people in Hawaii without apparent consequences, and patients presenting with meningitis symptoms had a history of eating raw snails or [[prawn]]s in the weeks before presenting with symptoms. This observation, along with epidemiology and [[autopsy]] of infected brains, confirmed ''A. cantonensis'' infection in humans as the cause of the majority of eosinophilic meningitis cases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=J.E.|title=The discovery of Angiostrongylus cantonensis as a cause of human eosinophilic meningitis|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=7|issue=6|pages=151–153|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(91)90285-v|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, cases of ''A. cantonensis'' infestations have appeared in  [[American Samoa]], Australia, [[Hong Kong]], [[Bombay]], [[Fiji]], Hawaii, [[Honshu]], [[India]], [[Kyushu]], [[New Britain]], [[Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]], [[Western Samoa]], and most recently mainland [[China]]. Other sporadic occurrences of the parasite in its rat hosts have been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Louisiana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2013, ''A. cantonensis'' was confirmed present in [[Florida]], USA, where its range and prevalence are expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwanowicz DD, Sanders LR, Schill WB, Xayavong MV, da Silva AJ, Qvarnstrom Y, Smith T | title = Spread of the Rat Lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) in Giant African Land Snails (Lissachatina fulica) in Florida, USA | journal = Journal of Wildlife Diseases | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 749–53 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25973628 | doi = 10.7589/2014-06-160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a case was found in a [[New York City|New Yorker]], who had visited Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|title=New York teen contracts rat lungworm during Hawaii vacation|last=|first=|date=|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413052417/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the parasite has been shown to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food-consumption trends and global transportation of food products.

==Pathogenesis of human angiostrongylosis==
The presence of parasitic worms burrowed in the neural tissue of the human [[central nervous system]] will cause obvious complications. All of the following will result in damage to the CNS:{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

# Direct mechanical damage to neural tissue from the worms' motion
# Toxic byproducts such as nitrogenous waste
# [[Antigen]]s released by dead and living parasites

==Eosinophilic meningitis==
{{See also|Eosinophilic meningitis}}
Although the clinical disease caused by ''Angiostrongylus'' invasion into the central nervous system is commonly referred to as "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the [[meninges]], or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck, and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing [[Neurological disorder|neurologic]] symptoms depending on where in the brain [[parenchyma]] they migrate. Neurologic findings and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms. This inflammation can lead in the short term to paralysis, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbance, and coma and in the long term to permanent nerve damage, mental retardation, nerve damage, permanent brain damage, or death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang QP, Lai DH, Zhu XQ, Chen XG, Lun ZR | title = Human angiostrongyliasis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 621–30 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18922484 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70229-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eosinophilic meningitis is commonly defined by the increased number of [[eosinophil]]s in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In most cases, eosinophil levels rise to 10 or more eosinophils per μl in the CSF, accounting for at least 10% of the total CSF [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] (white blood cell) count.&lt;ref name="urlwww.dhh.louisiana.gov"&gt;[http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf "EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS"]. Revised 28 February 2006, accessed 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical analysis of the CSF typically resembles the findings in "[[aseptic meningitis]]" with slightly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. Presence of a significantly decreased glucose on CSF analysis is an indicator of severe [[meningoencephalitis]] and may indicate a poor [[Prognosis|medical outcome]]. Initial CSF analysis early in the disease process may occasionally show no increase of eosinophils, only to have classical increases in eosinophils in subsequent CSF analysis. Caution should be advised in using eosinophilic meningitis as the only criterion for diagnosing angiostrongylus infestation in someone with classic symptoms, as the disease evolves with the migration of the worms into the CNS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells of the [[Granulocyte|granulocytic]] cell line which contain granules in their [[cytoplasm]]. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules degranulate, or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by [[chemokine]]s when the body is infested with parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Once at the site of inflammation, type 2 cytokines are released from [[T helper cell|helper T cells]], which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of [[degranulation]], releasing their toxic [[protein]]s in the fight against the foreign parasite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Clinical signs and symptoms===
According to a group [[case study]], the most common symptoms in mild eosinophilic meningitis tend to be headache (with 100% of people in the study suffering from this symptom), [[photophobia]] or visual disturbance (92%), neck stiffness (83%), fatigue (83%), [[hyperesthesia]]s (75%), vomiting (67%), and [[paresthesia]]s (50%).&lt;ref name="Murphy 35–40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Incubation period]] is often 3 weeks, but can be 3–36 days&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and even 80 days.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng YT, Tsai HC, Sy CL, Lee SS, Wann SR, Wang YH, Chen JK, Wu KS, Chen YS | title = Clinical manifestations of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: 18 years' experience in a medical center in southern Taiwan | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21524976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
The diagnosis of disease caused by ''A. cantonensis'' infestation is often difficult and relies heavily on the history of a likely ingestion of a commonly infested host and the presence of typical features of the disease. The presumptive diagnosis is particularly strong when eosinophilic meningoencephalitis can be confirmed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis can be arrived at through detection of elevated cranial pressure and increased numbers of eosinophils. The diagnosis of the cause of eosinophilic meningitis and the presence of ''A. cantonensis'' is remarkably more difficult. A [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]], or a sample of CSF, must be taken to search for ''A. cantonensis'' worms or larvae. ''A. cantonensis'' is undetectable in the CSF of more than half of the infected individuals. Current methods of detecting specific antigens associated with ''A. cantonensis'' are also unreliable. Consequently, alternative approaches to detect antigen-[[antibody]] reactions are being explored, such as [[Agglutination-PCR|immuno-PCR]].&lt;ref name="urlImmuno-PCR for Detection of Antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis Circulating Fifth-Stage Worms -- Chye et al. 50 (1): 51 -- Clinical Chemistry"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chye SM, Lin SR, Chen YL, Chung LY, Yen CM | title = Immuno-PCR for detection of antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis circulating fifth-stage worms | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14709636 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.020867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid dot-blot [[ELISA|ELISA test]] is also available for quick, effective, and economical on-site diagnosis of  ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eamsobhana P, Yong HS | title = Immunological diagnosis of human angiostrongyliasis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda: Angiostrongylidae) | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19117782 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.09.021 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971208016834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Costello''' (born 20 February 1953) is a British paediatrician. Until 2015. Costello was Professor of International Child Health and Director of the Institute for Global Health at the [[University College London]]. Costello was most notable for his work on improving survival among mothers and their newborn infants in poor populations of developing countries.

==Life==
Costello was born in [[Beckenham]], and graduated from school at [[St Joseph's Academy, Blackheath|St Joseph's Academy]]. Costello attended [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] where he took a degree in Experimental Psychology and qualified as a doctor in Medical Sciences after clinical training at the [[Middlesex Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |title=International MNCA expert named as Director, WHO Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health |url=http://www.who.int/life-course/news/new-mca-director/en/ |website=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=8 July 2018 |location=GENEVA, SWITZERLAND |date=Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then trained in Paediatrics and Neonatology at [[University College London]].

He and his wife, Helen, have two sons, Harry and Ned, and one daughter, Freya.&lt;ref name="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honigsbaum|first1=Mark|title=Anthony Costello: making climate change part of global health|journal=The Lancet|date=16 May 2009|volume=373|issue=9676|page=1669|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60929-6|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2016}}
After living in Baglung district in western Nepal from 1984–1986, two days walk from a road, he became fascinated by challenges to mother and child health in poor, remote populations. His areas of scientific expertise include the evaluation of cost-effective interventions to reduce maternal and newborn deaths, women’s groups, strategies to tackle malnutrition, international aid and the health effects of climate change. In 1999 he published a pioneering book on how to improve newborn infant health in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;1999: Improving Newborn Infant Health in Developing Countries. Imperial and World Scientific Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

With a Nepali organisation (MIRA), that he helped to establish, a large community trial of participatory learning and action using women’s groups in the remote mountains of Makwanpur district, Nepal was published in The Lancet in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;2004: Effect of a participatory intervention with women's groups on birth outcomes in Nepal: cluster-randomised controlled trial. 2004 Lancet 364: 970–99.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish partnerships and further studies with local organisations in eastern India, Mumbai, Bangladesh and Malawi. Seven cluster randomised controlled trials of women’s groups in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Malawi, led to a meta-analysis published in the Lancet in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;2013: Women's groups practising participatory learning and action to improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings: systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet 2013 May 18;381(9879): 1736-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results showed that in populations where more than 30% of pregnant women joined the women's group programme, maternal death and newborn deaths were cut by one third. The intervention has now been recommended by the World Health Organisation for scale-up in poor, rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;2014: WHO recommendation on community mobilization through facilitated participatory learning and action cycles with women's groups for maternal and newborn health. World Health Organization; {{ISBN|978 92 4 150727 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Costello chaired the 2009 Lancet Commission on Managing the Health Effects of Climate Change,&lt;ref&gt;2009: Managing the health effects of climate change: Lancet and University College London Institute for Global Health Commission.  Lancet. 2009 May 16; 373(9676): 1693-1733.&lt;/ref&gt; and was co-chair of a new Lancet Commission which links the UK, China, Norway and Sweden on emergency actions to tackle the climate health crisis, published in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60854-6/abstract|title=Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health|first1=Nick|last1=Watts|first2=W.

At WHO he has helped to lead the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016‒2030) with its three objectives of survive, thrive and transform – to end preventable mortality, to promote health and well-being, and to expand enabling environments. Its guiding principles include equity, universality, human rights, development effectiveness and sustainability.

With the WHO team he has also launched the global accelerated action for the health of adolescents (AA-HA!) and established an expert review group called  Maternal and Newborn Information for tracking Outcomes and Results (MONITOR) to harmonize maternal and newborn health indicators.

In February 2017, together with UNICEF and UNFPA  he helped to launched the Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health to introduce evidence-based interventions to improve quality of care for maternal and newborn health supported by a learning system. The Network involves Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Malawi, Côte d'Ivoire, Uganda, Tanzania and Ghana. He also leads work on community empowerment for family health - what it means, how to measure it, and how to plan interventions at district level.

With the Lancet he is a co-chair of their new Countdown Commission on Climate Change which reports progress annually on climate change adaptation, mitigation, economics, energy policy and public engagement. With UNICEF he is helping WHO to coordinate a new Lancet Commission on redesigning child health for the Sustainable Development Goals era.

'''Commentary on Edward Snowden's disclosure''' is part of the [[reactions to global surveillance disclosures]] made by [[Edward Snowden]].

==Executive branch==
On June 8, 2013, [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) [[James R. Clapper]] denounced as "reckless" the disclosures of "intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe."&lt;ref name="probereq"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/09/us-usa-security-clapper-idUSBRE9570GL20130609 |title= Spy agency seeks criminal probe into leaks |last1=Gardner |first1=Timothy |first2=Mark |last2=Hosenball |date=June 9, 2013 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He condemned the leaks as having done "huge, grave damage" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.&lt;ref name="washclapper"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/09/clapper-leaks-are-literally-gut-wrenching-leaker-being-sought/ |title=Clapper: Leaks are 'literally gut-wrenching,' leaker being sought |first1=Aaron |last1=Blake |date=June 9, 2013 |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that month, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] was dismissive of Snowden, saying, "I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama downplays Snowden case, says US not 'scrambling jets' to get 'hacker'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/27/obama-downplays-snowden-case-says-us-not-scrambling-jets-to-get-hacker/|newspaper=Fox News|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pecquet|first=Julian|title=US won't 'scramble jets' to capture 'hacker' Snowden, Obama says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/global-affairs/africa/308117-obama-wont-scramble-jets-to-capture-hacker-snowden|newspaper=The Hill|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans would have been better off if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed.&lt;ref name=CNN081313&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Z. Byron|title=Fact-checking Obama's claims about Snowden|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower|publisher=CNN|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also said that he had "called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, and I think the American people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place."&lt;ref name=CNN081313/&gt;

On August 4, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Martin Dempsey]] said on the weekly ABC interview show ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' that Snowden "has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate."&lt;ref name="ThisWeek"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/joint-chiefs-chairman-gen-martin-dempsey-week-19865953. |title=Transcript for Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey on 'This Week' |date=August 4, 2013 |first=Martha |last=Raddatz |work=ABC News 'This Week' |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, DNI Clapper acknowledged that Snowden may have done a public service and started a needed debate about the balance between privacy and security.
"As loath as I am to give any credit for what's happened here, which was egregious, I think it's clear that some of the conversations that this has generated, some of the debate, actually probably needed to happen," he said. "It's unfortunate they didn't happen some time ago, but if there's a good side to this, that's it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waterman|first=Shaun|title=Congress will rein in NSA's domestic snooping, predicts top U.S. intel official|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/us-spy-congress-rein-in-nsa-domestic-snooping/|accessdate=September 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dilanian|first=Ken|title=Clapper: Snowden case brings healthy debate; more disclosures to come|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-clapper-snowden-disclosures-20130912,0,7438979.story|accessdate=September 15, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2014, DNI Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He asked that "Snowden and his accomplices" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word "accomplices" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, "Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs."&lt;ref&gt;

===Former executive branch officials===
In late June 2013, Former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] said: "He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far ... I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Tom (June 30, 2013).

Earlier that month, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] suggested that Snowden might be a spy working for the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Snowden is a 'traitor' and possible spy for China – Dick Cheney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/16/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-traitor-cheney|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former U.S. intelligence officials speculated that Chinese or Russian intelligence agents might have gleaned additional classified material from Snowden,&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, John R.

[[Stewart Baker]], a former NSA general counsel in the early 1990s, said at a July 18, 2013 hearing, "I am afraid that hyped and distorted press reports orchestrated by Edward Snowden and his allies may cause us – or other nations – to construct new restraints on our intelligence gathering, restraints that will leave us vulnerable to another security disaster."&lt;ref name="wapo717hearing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-committee-holds-hearing-on-nsa-surveillance-programs/2013/07/17/ffc3056c-eee3-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html|title=Lawmakers of both parties voice doubts about NSA surveillance programs|date=July 17, 2013|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=William|last=Branigin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA and NSA chief [[General Michael Hayden]] in late June 2013 welcomed the public debate about the balance between privacy and security that the leaks had provoked: "I am convinced the more the American people know exactly what it is we are doing in this balance between privacy and security, the more they know the more comfortable they will feel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/30/former-cia-nsa-chief-michael-hayden-open-spy-progr/ Former CIA, NSA chief Michael Hayden: Open spy programs to reassure U.S. public], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', June 30, 2013.

Retrieved Jul 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old [[Soviet Union]]: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed -- and most of them ended up alcoholics."&lt;ref name="snowdenalcoholic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Andrea|title=Former NSA chief: 'Morally arrogant' Snowden will probably become an alcoholic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/09/17/former-nsa-chief-morally-arrogant-snowden-will-probably-become-an-alcoholic/?tid=btm_rex_1|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[University of Connecticut]] on April 23, 2014, former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] insinuated that she found Snowden's motives suspicious. "When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was puzzled because we have all these protections for whistle-blowers. If he were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have been," she said. "But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships, to put it mildly." Clinton added, "I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/defense/hillary-clinton-edward-snowden-s-leaks-helped-terrorists-20140425 |title=Hillary Clinton: Edward Snowden's Leaks Helped Terrorists |publisher=NationalJournal.com |date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it would be best if the American government granted him amnesty to get him back to America where he can answer questions without the threat of prosecution...

Further, Toobin questioned "whether the government can function when all of its employees (and contractors) can take it upon themselves to sabotage the programs they don’t like".&lt;ref name="toobin"/&gt;

The editors of [[Bloomberg News]] argued that, while the government ought to prosecute Snowden, the media's focus on Snowden took attention away from issues of U.S. government surveillance, the interpretations of the [[Patriot Act]], and the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) court actions, all of which are "what really matters in all this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editors |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-24/this-is-not-about-edward-snowden.html |title=This Is Not About Edward Snowden |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |location=New York |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald accused the media in the U.S. of focusing on Edward Snowden instead of on wrongdoing by [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James R.

Cybersecurity scholar [[P. W. Singer|Peter Singer]] divided the material disclosed by Snowden into three categories: "smart, useful espionage against enemies of the United States; legally questionable activities that involved US citizens through backdoors and fudging of policy/law; un-strategic (stupid) actions targeting American allies that has had huge blowback on US standing and US business." It was postulated that these were differing ways people viewed Snowden, which could explain why he was so polarizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=The three types of NSA snooping that Edward Snowden revealed|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/01/03/the-three-types-of-nsa-snooping-that-edward-snowden-revealed/|accessdate=January 4, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer also spoke of a "double legacy" from the NSA revelations released by Snowden: "One, it's hollowed out the American ability to operate effectively in ensuring the future of the internet itself, in the way we would hope it would be. That has huge long-term consequences. And the second is, it's been and will be a hammer-blow to American technology companies.

===Public opinion polls===
Surveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures, and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S.

====United States====
=====2013=====
*June 10–11, 2013: [[Gallup Poll|Gallup]] poll showed 44 percent of Americans thought it was right for Snowden to share the information with the press while 42 percent thought it was wrong.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/163043/americans-disapprove-government-surveillance-programs.aspx|title=Americans Disapprove of Government Surveillance Programs|newspaper=Gallup|first= Frank |last=Newport|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*June 17–18: [[Rasmussen Reports]] asked Americans to describe Snowden in a single word. Twelve percent said he was a hero, 21 percent called him a traitor, 34 percent said he fell somewhere in between, and 29 percent said it was too early to tell.&lt;ref name= RasmussenJun19&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/june_2013/12_see_nsa_leaker_snowden_as_hero_21_as_traitor |title=12% See NSA Leaker Snowden As Hero, 21% As Traitor |agency=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked their view of Snowden, respondents indicating "favorable" rose from 40 percent to 42 percent then down to 36 percent. "Unfavorable" grew steadily from 39 percent to 41 percent to 43 percent. Those supporting his prosecution increased from 27 percent to 34 percent and held there; those opposed steadily declined from 32 percent to 31 percent to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.yougov.com/news/2013/07/03/snowden-stays-russia-he-slips-public-opinion/ |title=As Snowden Stays In Russia, He Slips In Public Opinion |agency=[[YouGov]] |date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*November 14–17: ''The Washington Post''-ABC News poll found a significant shift in opinion as to whether or not Snowden ought to be charged with a crime. In contrast to the same organizations' June poll, November's results showed 52 percent favoring his prosecution (up from 43 percent) and 38 percent opposed (down from 48 percent). Similarly, when asked whether, irrespective of his being charged with a crime, Snowden was right or wrong to disclose the NSA intelligence-gathering efforts, 37 percent said he was right and 55 percent said he was wrong. All told, nearly two to one (60 percent versus 32 percent) thought Snowden's disclosures had harmed U.S. national security.&lt;ref name="WaPoPollNov2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/21/National-Politics/Polling/release_277.xml?uuid=76wqAlJpEeOe5iWACG2CVA |title=Snowden and the NSA - November 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2014=====
*January 15–19: ''USA Today''/Pew Research poll reported little change from the previous June on the question of the government pursuing a criminal case against Snowden, with 56 percent in favor and 32 percent opposed. The poll found that people younger than 30 offered the least support for prosecution, being evenly divided at 42 percent in favor and 42 percent opposed. Over all age groups, opinion was also nearly equally divided as to whether or not Snowden's disclosures had served the public interest: 45 percent said yes, while 43 percent said Snowden harmed the public interest.&lt;ref name="PewJan2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/01/20/obamas-nsa-speech-has-little-impact-on-skeptical-public/ |title=Obama's NSA Speech Has Little Impact on Skeptical Public |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*January 22: [[CBS News]] poll revealed a larger split (almost 3:1) as to whether or not Snowden ought to stand trial for his actions, with 61 percent in favor and 23 percent saying he should be granted amnesty. CBS News also differed from Pew Research on the issue of whether or not Snowden's disclosures had been good for the country, with 40 percent saying yes and 46 percent saying it had been bad. When asked to come up with a word that best describes Snowden, nearly a quarter of respondents volunteered either "traitor" or a similar word questioning his loyalty to his country, while 8 percent said he is "brave" or "courageous" or "a hero." Just 2 percent volunteered that he is a "patriot" or "patriotic," and another 2 percent said "terrorist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poll: Most think Edward Snowden should stand trial in U.S. |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-most-think-edward-snowden-should-stand-trial-in-us/|publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*June 1: An NBC News poll of registered voters found that 34 percent opposed Snowden's leaks, 24 percent backed him and another 40 percent had no opinion. Among those who closely followed the story, 49 percent opposed his actions and 33 percent supported them.

*July 14: Pew Research Center found worldwide opposition to U.S. eavesdropping and a decline in the view that the U.S. respects its people's personal freedoms, but little evidence that America's overall image had been severely damaged. While the majority of Americans and others condoned spying on suspected terrorists, they agreed it is unacceptable to spy on American citizens.&lt;ref name=PewJuly2014&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/ |title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
On January 1, 2014, the editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Snowden as a whistleblower and wrote in favor of granting him clemency, arguing that while Snowden may have broken the law, he had "done his country a great service" by bringing the abuses of the NSA to light. "When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law," they wrote, "that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government." ''The Times'' cast doubt on the claim made by Snowden's critics that he had damaged national security, and concluded with a request to President Obama to discontinue the "vilification" of Snowden and to give him "an incentive to return home."&lt;ref name=NYTWhistleblower&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/opinion/edward-snowden-whistle-blower.html |title=Edward Snowden, Whistle-Blower |author=Editorial Board of ''The New York Times'' |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2014/01/02/does-edward-snowden-deserve-clemency/4288535/ |title=Rieder: Why Edward Snowden should get clemency |work=USA Today |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article garnered an unusual amount of blowback for an editorial, with responses from multiple media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/weeks-in-the-making-an-editorial-on-snowden-may-go-beyond-what-is-realistic/ |work=The New York Times |first=Margaret |last=Sullivan |title=Weeks in the Making, an Editorial on Snowden May Go ‘Beyond What Is Realistic' |date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' called for a pardon in an editorial coincidentally published the same day, saying Snowden should be allowed to return home with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/snowden-affair-case-for-pardon-editorial |title=Snowden affair: the case for a pardon |work=The Guardian |date=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Satter |first=Raphael |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2-newspapers-calls-clemency-edward-snowden |title=2 newspapers call for clemency for Edward Snowden |work=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106091023/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2-newspapers-calls-clemency-edward-snowden |archivedate=January 6, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 4, 2014 article, [[Peter Baker (author)|Peter Baker]] of ''The New York Times'' laid out the polarization of opinions throughout the U.S. and the impetus toward clemency gained by public reaction to Snowden's revelations. Yet despite a growing backlash against government surveillance, Baker noted, calls for leniency had made little headway in the White House, Justice Department, or national security establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Peter, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/moves-to-curb-spying-help-drive-the-clemency-argument-for-snowden.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20140105 Moves to Curb Spying Help Drive the Clemency Argument for Snowden]," ''The New York Times'', January 5, 2014, page A16&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the editorial board of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' characterized the issue of whether Snowden deserved a presidential pardon as "a complicated question" to which the president's answer should be "no".&lt;ref name="No Pardon"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/edward-snowden-doesnt-deserve-a-pardon/2016/09/17/ec04d448-7c2e-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html |title=No pardon for Edward Snowden |author=''Washington Post'' Editorial Board |date=September 17, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the ''Post'' credited Snowden for "necessary reforms" brought about by his revelations of ''en masse'' collection of telephone data by the NSA, but stressed Snowden's separate leak of information about the agency's [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program and other "basically defensible" intelligence operations as reasons why he should face trial, saying that Snowden hurt his credibility as "an avatar of freedom" by accepting asylum in Russia.&lt;ref name="No Pardon"/&gt; The editors of the ''Post'' dismissed calls from human-rights organizations for clemency because of Snowden's "noble purposes" and the policy changes resulting from the leaks, and urged the president not to pardon Snowden despite the ''Post'' itself being responsible for publishing some of the leaked material.&lt;ref name="Post says"&gt;{{cite news |author=Greenslade, Roy |date=September 19, 2016 |title=Washington Post says Obama should not pardon whistleblower Ed Snowden |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/sep/19/washington-post-says-obama-should-not-pardon-whistleblower-ed-snowden}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Guardian'', the editorial stunned many American journalists.&lt;ref name="Post says"/&gt; Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists to whom Snowden had initially leaked the classified documents, characterized the ''Post'' editorial as "an act of journalistic treachery" and "cowardice", noting that the ''Post'' had accepted a [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service|Pulitzer Prize]] for publishing Snowden's leaks concerning PRISM and the other operations mentioned in its editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/09/18/washpost-makes-history-first-paper-to-call-for-prosecution-of-its-own-source-after-accepting-pulitzer/ |title=WashPost Makes History: First Paper to Call for Prosecution of Its Own Source (After Accepting Pulitzer) |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |date=September 18, 2016 |website=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental organizations==
[[File:Navanethem Pillay.jpg|thumb|[[Navi Pillay]], the United Nations' [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said: "Without prejudging the validity of any asylum claim by Snowden, I appeal to all States to respect the internationally guaranteed [[Right of asylum|right to seek asylum]]."&lt;ref name="unitednationshr"/&gt;]]
After [[Amnesty International]] met Edward Snowden in Moscow in mid July 2013, the organization said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What he has disclosed is patently in the public interest and as a whistleblower his actions were justified. He has exposed unlawful sweeping surveillance programmes that unquestionably interfere with an individual’s right to privacy. States that attempt to stop a person from revealing such unlawful behaviour are flouting international law. [[Freedom of expression]] is a fundamental right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/amnesty-international-meets-us-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-07-12 Amnesty International meets US whistleblower Edward Snowden] July 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Widney Brown, Senior Director of Amnesty, feared that Snowden would be at "great risk" of human rights violations if forcibly transferred to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USA must not hunt down whistleblower Edward Snowden|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-hunt-down-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-06-24|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and urged no country to return Snowden to the US. Michael Bochenek, Director of Law and Policy at Amnesty International deplored the US pressure on governments to block Snowden's asylum attempts, saying "It is his unassailable right, enshrined in international law".&lt;ref name="amnesty1"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/usa-must-not-persecute-whistleblower-edward-snowden-2013-07-02 USA must not persecute whistleblower Edward Snowden] July 2, 2013 Amnesty&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] said that if Snowden were able to raise the issue of NSA [[mass surveillance]] without facing espionage charges, he would not have left the United States in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US: Protect National Security Whistleblowers|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/18/us-protect-national-security-whistleblowers|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch writes that any country where Snowden seeks asylum should consider his claim fairly and protect his rights under international law, which recognizes that revealing official secrets is sometimes justified in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/03/countries-should-consider-snowden-s-asylum-claim-fairly Countries Should Consider Snowden’s Asylum Claim Fairly"]. Human Rights Watch, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Navi Pillay]], the United Nations [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]], said: "Snowden's case has shown the need to protect persons disclosing information on matters that have implications for human rights, as well as the importance of ensuring respect for the right to privacy".&lt;ref name="unitednationshr"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN rights chief urges protection for individuals revealing human rights violations|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?Cr=asylum&amp;NewsID=45399#.Uf7eH6y_S28|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblowers ===
[[Daniel Ellsberg]], the whistleblower and leaker of the top-secret [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971, stated in an interview with CNN that he thought Snowden had done an "incalculable" service to his country and that his leaks might prevent the United States from becoming a surveillance state. He said Snowden had acted with the same sort of courage and patriotism as a soldier in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Malley |first=Nick |title=NSA leaker reveals himself after fleeing US |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=June 10, 2013 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/nsa-leaker-reveals-himself-after-fleeing-us-20130610-2nz6h.html |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed the following morning, Ellsberg added that "there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden's release of NSA material ... including the Pentagon Papers."&lt;ref name="ellsbergstasi"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellsberg |first=Daniel |title=Edward Snowden: saving us from the United Stasi of America |work=The Guardian |date=June 10, 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray McGovern]], a retired CIA officer turned political activist, agreed with Ellsberg and added, "This time today I'm feeling much more hopeful for our democracy than I was feeling this time yesterday."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Noor |first=Jaisal |title=Former CIA Analyst: Snowden Did The Right Thing |newspaper=The Real News Network |date=June 11, 2013 |url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=10297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a whistleblower who disclosed details of the NSA's mass surveillance activities, said that Snowden had "performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing."  After Snowden cited a conversation with a "reliable source" about allegations that the US was "hacking into China", Binney felt he was "transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor."&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;Eisler, Peter; Page, Susan (June 16, 2013).

''USA Today'' (Washington DC). Retrieved June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Andrews Drake|Thomas Drake]], former senior executive of NSA and whistleblower, said that he feels "extraordinary kinship" with Snowden. "What he did was a magnificent act of civil disobedience. He's exposing the inner workings of the surveillance state. And it's in the public interest. It truly is."&lt;ref name="usatoday1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/12/snowden-surveillance-subverting-constitution Snowden saw what I saw: surveillance criminally subverting the constitution] ''The Guardian''.

[[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] hailed Snowden as a "hero" who has exposed "one of the most serious events of the decade – the creeping formulation of a mass surveillance state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Addley |first=Esther |title=Julian Assange praises Edward Snowden as a hero |newspaper=The Guardian |date=June 10, 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/10/julian-assange-praises-edward-snowden |accessdate= June 10, 2013 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After charges against Snowden were revealed, Assange released a statement asking people to "step forward and stand with" Snowden.&lt;ref&gt;Dart, Tom (June 22, 2013).

Retrieved June 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following President Obama's assurances that changes are planned for the NSA surveillance program, Assange said in a written statement that Obama had "validated Edward Snowden's role as a whistle-blower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Jackson |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/08/11/obama-snowden-assange-nsa-surveillance/2640217/ |title=Assange: Obama 'validates' Snowden |work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/10/us-usa-surveillance-assange-idUSBRE9790A920130810 |title=Assange calls Obama reform plans 'victory of sorts' for Snowden |agency=Reuters |date=August 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shamai Leibowitz]], who leaked details about an FBI operation, said that the legal threats and "smear campaign" against Snowden are a "grave mistake" because "If the government really wanted to keep more secrets from coming out, they would do well to let this man of conscience go live his life in some other country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/blowback-white-house-whistleblowers Blowback from the White House's vindictive war on whistleblowers]."

He further explained that Snowden "had to escape the US to ensure any chance of freedom", claiming the US had made Snowden stateless by revoking his passport while in Russia, leading to his temporary asylum in the country. Drake praised Russia, saying it had "actually recognized the international law and granted him political asylum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/rt-whistleblowers-snowden-prize-983/ 'US unchained itself from constitution': Whistleblowers on RT after secret Snowden meeting — RT News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cristina Possas de Albuquerque''' (born 5 June 1948) is a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] and [[emerging infectious disease]]s from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, N., "Epidemiology and the web of causation: has anyone seen the spider?"

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199750351}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, her approach to social ecosystem complexity is quite different from the four-fold eco-social approach of Harvard's Nancy Krieger in that she has proposed in a 2001 English-language article in the ''Brazilian Journal of Public Health Reports'' the concept of "social ecosystem health" where ecosystems are increasingly changed by social human activity, favoring the emergence of diseases, so the term "social" should precede the prefix "eco".&lt;ref&gt;Possas, C. 2001.

Her mentor and former colleague, Dr. [[Richard Levins]], had used the phrase "ecosocial view of health."&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, she is known for (a) developing her new conceptual approach to [[social epidemiology]], incorporating the economic concept of structural heterogeneity into an epidemiological model to identify the epidemiological profiles of heterogeneous populations in different social and economic strata and the conditions for emergence of diseases; (b) contributions of health policy and health reform in Brazil; and research on health transition, ecological change, complex systems, and emergence of new diseases.

As a Brazilian Brazilian [[public health]] scientist working with [[infectious diseases]] from an [[Ecosocial theory|eco-social]] perspective,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cristina Possas de Albuquerque (Cristina Possas) has as a policymaker long worked closely with public health and environmental scientists and with human rights and social justice civil organizations.

She also is a full professor at [[FIOCRUZ]] in Brazil, where in 1998 she had earned a PhD in [[public health]], and where she now does research on infectious diseases and teaches a course named "Scientific Methodology" in the Masters and Doctoral Programs.

She has been also a Professor of Health Policy at the National School of Public Health at the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], Brazil.  She was nominated in 1987 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health/Fiocruz to be the National Technical Coordinator of seven Groups supporting the Health Reform in Brazil, whose contributions were later incorporated into the new Brazilian 1988 Constitution.

For a decade, she also has been a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University, a Visiting Scientist and [[Fulbright Fellowship|Fulbright Fellow]], and a member of the Harvard New Diseases Group, coordinated by the late [[Richard Levins]] and by [[Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander]], collaborating with them and other outstanding members of the group in the organizing committee of the Woods Hole Conference on New Diseases, with articles with the group later published in a special supplement of the ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' on this conference and in other journals. She had held for 10 years a national position as the Head of the Research and Development Unit of the Brazilian National AIDS Program.

She has worked for more than five decades in several national and international positions with the scientific community and civil society organizations.  For ten years, she had been National Director of the Research and Technological Development Unit at the Brazilian [[AIDS]] Program in the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which has been recognized globally as an outstanding public health initiative with innovative approaches to the pandemics, always centering on free and universal access to prevention and treatment.  She was invited by the Director of the National AIDS Program to conceive and create a new and innovative Research and Technological Development Unit in the Program’s structure.

She has given interviews on [[AIDS]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqG-W1Xyoac Entrevista, Dr. Cristina Possas discusses AIDS, Dec 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[dengue fever|dengue]], and [[zika fever|zika]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of prominent figures===
:[[Garry Davis]] (Peace activist who created the first "World Passport)
:[[Albert Einstein]] ("The moral authority of the UN would be considerable enhanced if the delegates were elected directly by the people.")
:[[George Monbiot]] ("A world parliament allows the poor to speak for themselves")&lt;ref&gt;
George Monbiot "[http://www.monbiot.com/2007/04/24/no-more-ventriloquists/ No More Ventriloquists]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:[[Desmond Tutu]] ("We must strive for a global democracy, in which not only the rich and the powerful have a say, but which treats everyone, everywhere with dignity and respect.")&lt;ref&gt;
GiveYourVote "[http://giveyourvote.org/supporters Supporter Statements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318054459/http://giveyourvote.org/supporters |date=2010-03-18 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:[[Peter Ustinov]] (President of the World Federalist Movement from 1991 to 2004)
:[[Abhay Kumar|Abhay K]] ( "The mass availability of internet-connected mobile phones paves the way for planetary consciousness and global democracy.") &lt;ref&gt;Abhay K "[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg/2 Birth Of Global Democracy]", [[The Times of India]], Jan 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

'''''Dispatches''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio program, which aired on [[CBC Radio One]] from 2001 to 2012. The program, which was hosted by [[Rick MacInnes-Rae]], aired [[radio documentary|documentary]] reports on international news and feature topics.&lt;ref name=goodbye&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rick-macinnes-rae-says-goodbye-1.2711684 "Rick MacInnes-Rae says goodbye"]. [[CBC News]], July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening music was an excerpt from [[Mark Knopfler]]'s song "[[What It Is (Mark Knopfler song)|What It Is]]." 

Originally a half-hour program, the program expanded to a one-hour format in April 2007, incorporating some features of CBC Radio's cancelled [[world music]] series ''[[Global Village (radio show)|Global Village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"CBC changes format of Radio Two". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2012, the CBC announced it would cancel the program as part of its budget cuts as a result of the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese dynasties ===
[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31700">The '''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems''' (EOLSS) is an [[encyclopedia]] on the science of [[sustainable development]] and conservation of [[life support system]]s on [[earth]]. The extensive publication is published under the patronage of [[UNESCO]].

==Overview==
In 1996, international [[scientists]], [[engineers]], and policy makers were invited by the UNESCO to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mexico City]], [[Beijing]] and the [[Bahamas]] to generate a detailed list of EOLSS contents and achieve a global consensus and acceptance of its structure. Life support system means a natural or human constructed system that furthers the life of the [[biosphere]] in a sustainable fashion. The knowledge is structured in 21 topic areas: [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]; [[Mathematical sciences]]; [[Biological]], [[physiological]] and [[health sciences]]; [[Biotechnology]]; [[Land use]], [[land cover]] and [[soil sciences]]; [[Tropical]] biology and conservation management; [[Social sciences]] and [[humanities]]; [[Physical sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Control systems]], [[robotics]] and [[automation]]; [[Chemical sciences]] engineering and technology resources; [[Water Science|Water sciences]], engineering and technology resources; [[Energy|Energy sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Environmental and [[ecological |ecological sciences]], engineering and technology resources; Food and agricultural sciences, engineering and technology resources; [[Human resources]] policy, development and management; [[Natural resources]] policy and management; Development and economic sciences; Institutional and infrastructural resources; Technology, information and system management resources; Area studies (Africa, Brazil, Canada and USA, China, Europe, Japan, Russia); [[Desalination]] and water resources.

The way the encyclopedia is being compiled can be defined as [[crowdsourcing]], where thousands of intellectuals from all over the world and across various academic institutions are contributing. The encyclopedia relies on strict standards of [[peer review]] and the joint [[Paris]]-based UNESCO and EOLSS secretariat manages the encyclopedia in progress. It has got a publishing wing in [[Oxford]] as well which specializes in publishing various materials such as [[book]]s, [[e-books]] or scholarly [[subscription]]s.

The web portal of EOLSS receives maximum hits from the [[United States]] and [[India]]. If each hit is assumed to originate from one unique user, then USA has about 28% and India has about 10% of the users of this portal. The number of hits falls dramatically after we consider USA and India, whereas countries like [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Kingdom]] each contribute almost about 5% of the total hits. This shows that people familiar with English are feeling more comfortable in utilizing this project for their educational or knowledge seeking purposes and researches. The proportion of users from states of the [[European Union]] who do not speak English as native language is about 8 percent in total. The statistics are updated as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eolss.net EOLSS, official website], retrieved on 2004-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Av0Yq6cVk EOLSS], Introduction on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both GMA News TV and Q are products of an airtime lease agreement between ZOE-TV and Citynet in 2005 in exchange of upgrading the former's facilities and air its programs on Channel 11 and its affiliate [[GMA Network]] during off-peak hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2005/04/28/275585/gma-network-partners-zoe-broadcasting-channel-11|title=GMA Network partners with Zoe Broadcasting Channel 11|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMA News TV was unveiled on February 7, 2011, and Q was discontinued on February 20, 2011 in preparation for the launch of the new service, which occurred on February 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7578/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv-on-channel-11 PEP Entertainment Guide/Television&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/212269/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv GMA News Online, Business Top Stories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/214089/gma-news-tv-goes-on-air GMA News TV goes on air] retrieved via www.gmanews.tv 02-28-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3YoYOiPz84 GMA News TV Station ID 2011] retrieved via www.youtube.com via gmatv user 09-10-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main article|List of programs broadcast by GMA News TV|l1=List of programs broadcast by GMA News TV}}
Most of GMA News TV's programming consists of news, public affairs and sports programming produced by [[GMA News and Public Affairs]] including entertainment, lifestyle, cooking shows, talk shows, infotainment, local and foreign drama, comedy and reality series, travel, foreign animated series, infomercials and local and foreign movie blocks and additional programming produced by GMA Entertainment TV carried over from [[Q (TV network)|Q]].

As part of its agreement to operate [[DZOE-TV]] as a carrier of GMA News TV (dating back to the establishment of Q), it also airs religious programming produced by [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|ZOE]] during off-peak hours.

==International==
Later in 2011, GMA would also launch a 24-hour international feed of GMA News TV, as a compliment to its two other international channels ([[GMA Pinoy TV]] and [[GMA Life TV]]). It began to be offered as a preview channel in Australia on FetchTV, IPS/AccessTV in Japan, GUdTV in Guam and on [[OSN]], with an official launch planned for the third quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/226308/business/gma-network-launches-third-international-channel|title=GMA Network launches third international channel|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=328|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=612|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|title=EARNINGS: GMA Network posts 18% growth in Q1 revenues|work=GMA News Online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822165431/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|archivedate=2011-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMA News TV International was officially launched on [[UBI World TV]] on December 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/233887/pinoy-abroad/gma-news-tv-international-to-be-launched-in-australia-oct-1|title=GMA News TV International: to be launched in Australia Oct. 1|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[Canada|Canadian]] [[IPTV]] provider [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS TV]] added GMA News TV International, becoming its first Canadian carrier. In November 2012, [[Telus|Optik TV]] added the channel to their lineup. Additionally, GMA News TV international is now also available in [[Singtel TV]] Pay TV Customers in Singapore Channel 690 in [[Standard-definition television|SD]], on [[ABNXcess]] Pay TV Customers in Malaysia Channel 731 in [[SDTV|SD]] and also on [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]]

Unlike its domestic counterpart, programs on GMA News TV International are air tape-delayed, except for selected special events such as live coverage of Day 1 of [[Philippine general election, 2013|Eleksyon 2013]].

In Hong Kong, GMA News TV International Launch in [[Now TV (Hong Kong)|Now TV]] On June 2, 2015.

The '''General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans''' ('''GEBCO''') is a publicly available [[bathymetric chart]] of the world's [[ocean]]s. The project was conceived with the aim of preparing a global series of charts showing the general shape of the seafloor. Over the years it has become a reference map of the bathymetry of the world’s oceans for scientists and others.

==Organisation==
GEBCO operates under the joint auspices of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iho-ohi.net/english/committees-wg/ircc/gebco/gebco.html IHO Committees &amp; Working Groups listing for the GEBCO Guiding Committee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525093743/http://iho-ohi.net/english/committees-wg/ircc/gebco/gebco.html |date=2009-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC) of [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioc-unesco.org/index.php?option=com_oe&amp;task=viewDocumentRecord&amp;docID=2035 IOC/EC-XLI/2 Annex 8, Terms of Reference and Rules of Procedure of the Technical Sub-committee on Ocean Mapping (TSCOM), Sub-committee on Undersea Features Names (SCUFN) and Joint IHO–IOC GEBCO Guiding Committee, Authored by the IOC Secretariat, Published on 26/05/08]&lt;/ref&gt; Its work is done by an international group of experts in seafloor mapping who develop a range of bathymetric data sets and data products.

==Data sets and products==
[[Image:gebco atlantic.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Ocean]] 3D visualization]]
[[Image:Gebco 3D antarctic.jpg|thumb|[[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Ocean]] 3D visualization]]

Although originally GEBCO published paper [[contour line|contour charts]], today it has moved into the digital age and collects digital depths of the ocean from wherever they are available. GEBCO provides a range of bathymetric data sets and data products, including:

*Global gridded bathymetric data sets:
**GEBCO_08 Grid — a global bathymetric grid with 30 arc-second spacing, generated by combining quality-controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite-derived gravity data.
**GEBCO_2014 Grid — an update to the previously released GEBCO_08 Grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/gebco_30_second_grid/#history Update history of the GEBCO 30 arc-second grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
**GEBCO One Minute Grid — a global grid at one arc-minute intervals, based largely on the most recent set of bathymetric contours contained within the GEBCO Digital Atlas.
The grids are available to download from the [[British Oceanographic Data Centre]] ([[BODC]]) in the form of netCDF files, along with free software for displaying and accessing data in ASCII and netCDF. The grids can be used with the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) system.
*The GEBCO Digital Atlas — a two volume CDROM set which contains:
**The GEBCO One Minute Grid
**A global set of digital bathymetric contours and coastlines
**The GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names: a digital gazetteer of undersea feature names.
**A software interface for viewing and accessing the data sets
*The GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names — a digital gazetteer of undersea feature names used on sheets and products of GEBCO and Regional International Bathymetric Charts (IBC) projects, and on international (INT) nautical charts. It is available to be downloaded from the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).
*The GEBCO world map — a global, coloured, paper map of the bathymetry of the world's oceans based upon the GEBCO One Minute Grid. The map is available to be downloaded in the form of [[JPEG]] file.

==Project history==

The GEBCO chart series was initiated in 1903 by an international group of [[geographer]]s and oceanographers, under the leadership of [[Prince Albert I of Monaco]]. At that time there was an explosion of interest in the study of the natural world and this group recognized the importance of a set of maps describing the shape of the ocean floor. The first hundred years of the project were described in the book ''The History of GEBCO 1903-2003'' published by GITC in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/history_of_gebco/ ''The History of GEBCO 1903-2003''] published by GITC in 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays GEBCO’s role has become increasingly important, due to the increased interest in the oceans for scientific research and for the exploitation and conservation of resources.

Since 1903, five separate editions of paper, bathymetric contour charts covering the whole world have been produced. GEBCO is now maintained in digital form as the GEBCO Digital Atlas.

==Training==

The [[Nippon Foundation]] of Japan has provided funding for GEBCO to train a new generation of scientists and hydrographers in ocean bathymetry. The 12-month course, leading to a Postgraduate Certificate in Ocean Bathymetry (PCOB), has been held at the [[University of New Hampshire]], USA, since 2004. 60 GEBCO scholars from 31 different countries have completed the course and are supporting GEBCO programs.

[[File:Genoese map Indian Ocean.jpg|thumb|[[Indian ocean]] portion of the Genoese map.]]
The '''Genoese map''' is a 1457 [[world map]].  The map relied extensively on the account of the traveler to Asia [[Niccolo da Conti]], rather than the usual source of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is not known, but is a more modern development than the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], with fairly good proportions given to each continents.  The map also depicts a three-masted European ship in the [[Indian Ocean]], something which had not occurred yet at the time.&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998" /&gt;

A Genoese flag in the upper northwest corner of the map establishes this map’s origin, along with the coat of arms of the Spinolas, a prominent Genoese mercantile family. Niccolò de'Conti was from a noble mercantile family; at an early age he decided to follow in the family tradition by establishing a lucrative trading operation in the East.[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/niccolo-de-conti]

The Genoese map’s sea monsters reflect the cartographer’s interest in exotic wonders, which is everywhere in evidence on the map, and typical of the scientific outlook of the early modern period, which was driven by curiosity and took a great interest in marvels. The demon-like monster in particular is evidence of the cartographer’s research in recent travel literature to find sea monsters for his map.

This map was done in rich color and was not made particularly used for anything but for display.They say this map was sent to the Portuguese court in 1474 and then to Columbus and this is the map that he used to travel the India sea to the Atlantic but was never proven. The map is now the property of the Italian government and is to be found in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence however the map was not taken care of due to the way it’s been handled throughout the years.

The ships that could carry a thousand men—six hundred seamen and four hundred soldiers. The larger vessels also carried small boats, which were used, as Marco Polo states, “to lay out the anchors, catch fish, bring supplies aboard, and the like. When the ship is under sail, she carries these boats slung to her side.” Many of the vessels had as many as four decks, and even the smaller ones, fifty or sixty cabins. Vegetables, we are told, were sometimes grown on board.

The oval form is not unknown among medieval maps. Hugh of Saint Victor had described the world as being the shape of Noah’s Ark, and Ranulf Higden world maps were oval. A standard way of describing the earth was to compare it to an egg. The main purpose of the analogy seems to have been to describe the various spheres surrounding the earth (egg white, shell), but the idea of an egg shape could have been derived from these works. Another possibility is that the oval form represents the ''mandorla'', or nimbus, which surrounded Christ in many medieval works of art.

'''Glenn Hauser''' (born April 12, 1945 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is an internationally known American [[DXing|DX]]er&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=October 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettHardy1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Hank|last2=Hardy|first2=David T.|last3=Yoder|first3=Andrew R.|title=The complete shortwave listener's handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tmz9JIRHsC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=978-0-8306-4347-9|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio]] host from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The '''Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS)''' was founded in 2007 as an initiative of [[Seattle Children’s]]. GAPPS’ mission is to lead a collaborative, global effort to increase awareness and accelerate innovative research and interventions that will improve [[maternal health|maternal]], newborn and child health outcomes around the world, with a focus on [[preterm birth]] and [[stillbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/10/S1/S7 |title=Global report on preterm birth and stillbirth  |first= |last= |work=BMC Pregnancy &amp; Childbirth|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gapps.org/index.php/about/mission_vision/ |title=Mission and Vision |work=GAPPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GAPPS Repository==
The GAPPS Repository is a [[biobank]] of [[pregnancy]] specimens matched with data from patient questionnaires. It supports research on normal and abnormal pregnancies, including how pregnancy affects maternal and child health after [[childbirth|delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2012/03/14/seattle-childrens-sets-up-rare-biobank-of-pregnancy-specimens/ |title=Seattle Children's Sets Up Rare Biobank to Study Premature Birth |work=Xconomy|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120410_gapps_biorepository/en/index.html |title=New biorepository to help uncover mysteries of pregnancy and childbirth |work=World Health Organization |date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Repository is also available to researchers to study the [[fetal]] origins of persistent health problems like [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680302/a-library-of-samples-from-pregnant-women-to-help-disease-research |title=A Library of Samples From Pregnant Women To Help Disease Research |work=Fast Company |date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing Preterm Birth initiative==
In November 2011 the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] provided $20 million to GAPPS for the Preventing Preterm Birth initiative, part of the foundation's [[Grand Challenges in Global Health]]. The Preventing Preterm Birth initiative focuses on finding new interventions to prevent premature birth and stillbirth by limiting infection and improving nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/11/gates-foundation-awards-20m-for.html |title=Gates Foundation awards $20M for premature birth research |work=Puget Sound Business Journal |date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Landscapes Forum''' ('''GLF''') is a knowledge-led multi-stakeholder forum dedicated to promoting the [[Integrated landscape management|landscape approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peoplefoodandnature.org/blog/recognizing-common-ground-finding-meaning-in-integrated-landscape-management/ |title=Recognizing Common Ground: Finding Meaning in Integrated Landscape Management |last1=Friedman |first1=Rachel |last2=Shames |first2=Seth |last3=Sherr |first3=Sara |date=November 13, 2013 |website=EcoAgriculture Partners |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GLF is the largest knowledge-led platform on sustainable land use. Since 2013, over 3,900 organizations and 150,000 people have taken part in Forum events in person and online. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globallandscapesforum.org/about/what-is-glf|title=What is the Global Landscapes Forum? - Global Landscapes Forum|work=Global Landscapes Forum|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by the [[Center for International Forestry Research]] (CIFOR).

== History ==
The inaugural GLF event took place alongside to [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP 19) in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/11/17/1256032/-Warsaw-Global-Landscape-Forum-Lanches-Alongside-COP19 |title=Warsaw: Global Landscape Forum Launches Alongside COP19 |last=Phelan |first=Deborah |date=November 17, 2013 |website=[[Daily Kos]] |access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It heralded the merger of [[International Day of Forests|Forest Day]] and [[Agriculture and Rural Development Day]], reflecting a scientific climate that favored breaking down research silos and utilizing an integrated landscape approach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/11958/forest-day-time-to-move-on|title=Forest Day – time to move on|date=2012-12-02|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first four major GLF events were held annually on the sidelines of the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]].

Following a major funding injection from the German government, the GLF moved to establish a [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] in [[Bonn]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.globallandscapesforum.org/glf-marrakesh/pressroom/cop22-german-government-supports-establishment-global-landscapes-forum-bonn/|title=COP22: German government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn - 2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|work=2016 Global Landscapes Forum: Marrakesh|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of an effort on the part of the German government and the city of Bonn to establish a "sustainability cluster" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonn-international.org/international-profile/sustainability-cluster.html|title=Sustainability cluster - Bonn International|website=www.bonn-international.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==

CIFOR serves as the implementing organization of the GLF, and the current coordinating partners are the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

As of 2017, the host country partners are the German [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety]] (BMUB) and [[Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cifor.org/corporate-news/german-government-pledges-commitment-global-landscapes-forum-promote-research-connect-results-communities-ground/|title=German Government supports establishment of Global Landscapes Forum in Bonn|work=Center for International Forestry Research|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== Predecessor Events ===
Following a move towards more integrated landscape approaches in both the [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]] sides of the research for [[Development aid|development]] sphere, the Global Landscapes Forum was born out of a merger of [[Global Landscapes Forum#Forest Day|Forest Day]] and [[Global Landscapes Forum#Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD)|Agriculture and Rural Development Day]] (ARDD), both of which were formerly long-standing side events at the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] (COP).

==== Forest Day  ====
{{Main|International Day of Forests}}
Forest Day was an annual COP side event co-organized by CIFOR and the [[Collaborative Partnership on Forests]], since the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP13) in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of 2012, by resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on November 28, 2012, Forest Day became the [[International Day of Forests]].&lt;ref name=declaration&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/36014-063ec88fa19cab1dfe473d7813290b32.pdf "International Day of Forests,"] United Nations General Assembly, November 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sixth and final Forest Day was held on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

====Agriculture and Rural Development Day ====
{{Main|Agriculture and Rural Development Day}}
Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD) was an annual COP side event. The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5 (ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the COP18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Events ===
The first major GLF event took place in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] during the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP19).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forestsnews.cifor.org/19350/a-sustainable-development-goal-on-landscapes-setting-the-agenda-at-cop19-in-warsaw|title=A Sustainable Development Goal on Landscapes: Setting the agenda at COP19 in Warsaw|date=2013-10-04|work=CIFOR Forests News|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the major injection of funding from the German government during the [[Global Landscapes Forum#Marrakesh 2016: Climate Action for Sustainable Development|Marrakesh event]], the GLF moved to establish a more permanent presence in Bonn, Germany. While the [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP23) was held in Bonn the same year from November 6–17, 2017, the Global Landscapes Forum event took place just over a month later on December 19–20, 2017. This marked the first year that the GLF existed as its own entity and not as a COP side event. For the first time, the [[Wangari Maathai#Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award|Wangari Maathai Forest Champion Award]] was presented at the GLF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpfweb.org/93397/en/|title=Collaborative Partnership on Forests|last=Nations|first=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|website=www.cpfweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic Events ===
The first Investment Case event took place on June 10–11, 2015 at the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was an invitation-only symposium with 220 attendees from the finance sector.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globallandscapesforum.org/publication/london-final-report/|title=Global Landscapes Forum: The Investment Case — Final Report - Global Landscapes Forum|work=Global Landscapes Forum|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coordinated by the [[European Investment Bank]], UN Environment, the World Bank, and the [[Program on Forests]] (PROFOR). Sessions were hosted by the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[Unilever]], and the [[Climate Bonds Initiative]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The roadmap from this event were presented at a land use side event [[World Forestry Congress#14th World Forestry Congress: Durban, South Africa, 2015|14th World Forestry Congress]] (WFC XIV) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cifor.org/wfc-2015/session/wednesday/toward-roadmap-sustainable-landscape-investments-at-scale/|title=Toward a roadmap for sustainable landscape investments at scale: Inputs from forestry science|work=Center for International Forestry Research|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of which was ''Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future''.

Other key outcomes were presented to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) workplan for 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecoagriculture.org/event/global-landscapes-forum-the-investment-case/|title=EcoAgriculture Partners {{!}}   Global Landscapes Forum: The Investment Case|website=ecoagriculture.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and Policy Dialogues ===
Riau, Indonesia 2017: Laws and Best Practices for Reducing Fire and Haze

The [[AFR100]] initiative was launched at the GLF in Paris, 2015, and is also supported by the German government. Thus the GLF supported the Second Annual Partnership Conference in 2017, which brought together 23 partner countries, restoration champions, and technical partners such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), [[New Partnership for Africa's Development|New Partnership for Africa’s Development]] (NEPAD Agency), and [[World Vision International|World Vision]].

Organized with CIFOR, this policy dialogue workshop looked at gender-responsive [[Forest restoration#Forest landscape restoration|Forest and Landscape Restoration]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">'''Global apartheid''' is a term used to mean [[minority rule]] in international decision-making. The term comes from [[apartheid]], the system of governmental that ruled [[South Africa]] until 27 April 1994 when people of all races were able to vote as equals for the first time.

The concept of global apartheid has been developed by many researchers, including [[Titus Alexander]], [[Bruno Amoroso]], [[Patrick Bond]], [[Gernot Kohler]], [[Arjun Makhijiani]], [[Ali Mazuri]], [[Vandana Shiva]], Anthony H. Richmond, [[Joseph Nevins]], [[Muhammed Asadi]], [[Gustav Fridolin]], and many others.&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander"&gt;Titus Alexander, Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics, Polity Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Amoroso, Global Apartheid.

Asadi, Global Apartheid, iUniverse, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Per Gustav Edvard Fridolin,  Från Vittsjö till världen - om global apartheid och alla vi som vill någon annanstans (From Vittsjö to the world - about global apartheid and everyone of us that want to go somewhere), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and use ==
The first use of the term may have been by Gernot Koehler in a 1978 Working Paper for the [[World Order Models Project]].  In 1995 Koehler develop this in ''The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential''.&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 20, No. 3 (July-September 1995), pp. 403-413&lt;/ref&gt;

Its best known use was by [[Thabo Mbeki]], then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons of the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.&lt;ref&gt;Haviland, William (1993). Cultural Anthropology. Vermont: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers. p. 250-252&lt;/ref&gt;  Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of [[Charter 99]], a campaign for [[democratic mundialization|global democracy]], who was also present at the UN [[Millennium Summit]] and gave him a copy of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid''.

== Concept ==
Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa ''civilized labour'' policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of immigrants seeking work.

At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system ([[Bank of International Settlements]]), [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[Security Council]] and other institutions of global governance.  The [[G8]] represent less than 15% of world population, yet have over 60% of its income.  80% of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and [[WTO]] and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).  By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European.  Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority.

In ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', [[Samuel P. Huntington]] describes how "the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P Huntington The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, (p81)&lt;/ref&gt;  Huntington quoted Jeffrey R Bennett to claim that Western nations:&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey R Bennett ‘Exclusion as National Security Policy’, Parameters, 24, Spring 1994, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

* own and operate the international banking system
* control all hard currencies
* are the world’s principle customer
* provide the majority of the world’s finished goods
* dominate international capital markets
* exert considerable moral leadership within many societies
* are capable of massive military intervention
* control the sea lanes

Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ [p308]

Alexander identifies numerous ''pillars of global apartheid'' including:&lt;ref name="TitusAlexander" /&gt;
*veto power by the Western minority in the UN [[Security Council]] 
*voting powers in the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]]
*dominance of the [[World Trade Organization]] through effective veto power and ‘weight of trade’ rather than formal voting power
*one-sided rules of trade, which give privileged protection to Western agriculture and other interests while opening markets in the Majority World
*protection of ‘hard currency’ through the central banking system through the [[Bank of International Settlements]] 
*immigration controls which manage the flow of labour to meet the needs of Western economies 
*use of aid and investment to control elites in the Majority World through reward and punishment 
*support for coups or military intervention in countries which defy Western dominance

International decision-making has a legacy of [[international inequality|inequality]] which some authors{{Who|date=September 2015}} have compared to historical [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50038">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological Concepts and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S.

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3230">The '''INF World Rankings''' are published by the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF) to make it possible to compare the relative strengths of internationally active national [[netball]] teams. Initially, rankings were based on the results from the [[World Netball Championships]], and released after the conclusion of each event, every four years. A new ranking system was implemented on 11 February 2008, wherein teams are ranked based on international [[Test match (netball)|tests]] played, currently since July 2010. Teams appear on the rankings list once they have played eight international test matches, starting from July 2010. The rankings are updated by the INF every month. Australia and New Zealand have dominated the INF world rankings in previous years and they are the only two netball nations to have ever held the number one world ranking since its introduction in 2009.

The '''Indian subcontinent''' is a southern [[region]] and [[peninsula]] of [[Asia]], mostly situated on the [[Indian Plate]] and projecting southwards into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Himalayas]]. [[Geology|Geologically]], the Indian subcontinent is related to the land mass that rifted from [[Gondwana]] and merged with the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian plate]] nearly 55 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; [[Geography|Geographically]], it is the [[peninsula]]r region in south-central Asia delineated by the [[Himalayas]] in the north, the [[Hindu Kush]] in the west, and the [[Arakan Mountains|Arakanese]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Graham P. p. 10"/&gt; Politically, the Indian subcontinent includes [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;"Indian subcontinent". ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' ({{ISBN|0-19-860441-6}}) New York: Oxford University Press, 2001; p. 929: "the part of Asia south of the Himalayas which forms a peninsula extending into the Indian Ocean, between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Historically forming the whole territory of [[Greater India]], the region is now divided into three countries named [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dkumar889/&gt;&lt;ref name=pirbhai14/&gt;

Sometimes, the geographical term 'Indian subcontinent' is used interchangeably with '[[South Asia]]',&lt;ref name=mcleodplus/&gt; although that last term is used typically as a political term and is also used to include [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;As for example it is in the [[South Asian Games]] and the 8-nation [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), an economic cooperation organisation in the region, established in 1985, and ; {{cite web|last=SAARC Summit|title=SAARC|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/|publisher=SAARC Summit|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Which countries should be included in either of these remains the subject of debate.&lt;ref name=anderson5&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewan W.

== Name==

According to ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term "subcontinent" signifies a "subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity" and also a "large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent". It is first attested in 1845 to refer to the [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]s, before they were regarded as separate continents. Its use to refer to the Indian subcontinent is seen from the early twentieth century. It was especially convenient for referring to the region comprising both [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s under [[British Paramountcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=subcontinent|id=192528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=Indian subcontinent|id=94389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Indian subcontinent also has a geological significance. Similar to various continents, it was a part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. A series of tectonic splits caused formation of various basins, each drifting in various directions. The geological region called "Greater India" once included [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], [[Antarctica]] and Austrolasia along with the Indian subcontinent basin. As a geological term, Indian subcontinent has meant that region formed from the collision of the Indian basin with Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wynn Jones|title=Applications of Palaeontology: Techniques and Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrPiq_8pkAwC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49920-0|pages=267–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hinsbergen | first=D.

===Geology===
Geologically, the Indian subcontinent was first a part of so-called "Greater India",&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1/&gt; a region of [[Gondwana]] that drifted away from [[East Africa]] about 160 million years ago, around the Middle Jurassic period.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The region experienced high volcanic activity and plate subdivisions, creating Madagascar, Seychelles, Antarctica, Austrolasia and the Indian subcontinent basin. The Indian subcontinent drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Paleocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains one of the geologically active areas, prone to major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethany D.

Using the more expansive definition – counting India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries – the Indian subcontinent covers about 4.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent or 3.3% of the world's land surface area.&lt;ref name=JJCO&gt;Desai, Praful B. 2002.

The Indian subcontinent is a natural physical landmass in South Asia, geologically the dry-land portion of the [[Indian Plate]], which  has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"/&gt; 
Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John L. Esposito|author2=Emad El-Din Shahin|title=The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUcSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA453 |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-063193-2|pages=453–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; the valleys of [[Manipur]] in its east, and by maritime routes.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"/&gt; More difficult but historically important interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]. These routes and interactions have led to the [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|spread of Buddhism]]  out of the Indian subcontinent into other parts of Asia. And the [[Islamic conquests in India|Islamic expansion]] arrived into the Indian subcontinent in two ways, through Afghanistan on land and to Indian coast through the maritime routes on the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"&gt;{{citation|last1=Asher|first1=Catherine B.|last2=Talbot|first2=Cynthia|title=India Before Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC|date=2006-03-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80904-7|pp=5–8, 12–14, 51, 78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies. [[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], it had formed the whole territory of [[Greater India]].&lt;ref name="mittal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathleen M page 10"/&gt;

The term "Indian continent" is first introduced in the early 20th century, when most of the territory was  part of [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref&gt;"Indian subcontinent" is used by Henry D. Baker, ''British India With Notes On Ceylon Afghanistan And Tibet'' (1915), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.236168/2015.236168.British-India#page/n403/mode/2up p. 401].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu Kush]], centered on eastern  [[Afghanistan]], is the boundary connecting the Indian subcontinent with [[Central Asia]] to the northwest, and the [[Persian Plateau]] to the west.

The '''international community''' is a phrase used in [[geopolitics]] and [[international relations]] to refer to a broad group of people and governments of the world. It does not refer literally to all nations or states in the world. The term is typically used to imply the existence of a common point of view towards such matters as specific issues of [[human rights]]. An example Of International Community is the united nations. Activists, politicians and commentators often use the term in calling for action to be taken; e.g., action against what is in their opinion [[political repression]] in a target country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LQNYlTa1-YUC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=international+community+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw_Nukme7VAhWSHsAKHYBXApUQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20community%20term&amp;f=false|title=United States Hegemony and the Foundations of International Law|last=Byers|first=Michael|last2=Nolte|first2=Georg|date=2003-05-29|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=9781139436632|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is commonly used to imply legitimacy and consensus for a point of view on a disputed issue; e.g., to enhance the credibility of a majority vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gaJ9FCXnX5IC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22international+community%22+general+assembly&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfvYDRmu7VAhWkB8AKHSFDB1sQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22international%20community%22%20general%20assembly&amp;f=false|title=Law-Making in the International Community|last=Danilenko|first=Gennadiĭ Mikhaĭlovich|date=1993-01-01|publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|year=|isbn=0792320395|location=|pages=204|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Noam Chomsky]] alleges  the use of the  is used to refer to  [[United States]] and its allies and [[client state]]s, as well as allies in the media of those states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200209--.htm|title=The Crimes of ‘Intcom’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/06/14/israel-us-violators-of-international-law-says-noam-chomsky/|title=Israel, US violators of international law, says Noam Chomsky|work=The News Tribe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitemagazine.ca/2012/06/noam-chomsky-on-iran/|title=Noam Chomsky on Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar and academic [[Martin Jacques]] says: "We all know what is meant by the term 'international community', don't we? It's [[Western world|the west]], of course, nothing more, nothing less. Using the term 'international community' is a way of dignifying the west, of globalising it, of making it sound more respectable, more neutral and high-faluting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/aug/24/whatthehellistheinternati|title=What the hell is the international community?|author=Martin Jacques|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47233">This is a list of '''longest prison sentences served''' by a single person, worldwide, without a period of freedom followed by a second conviction. These cases rarely coincide with the [[list of longest prison sentences|longest prison sentences]] given, because some countries have laws that don't allow sentences without [[parole]] or for convicts to remain in prison beyond a given number of years (regardless of their original conviction).

{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:University of Pennsylvania/HSOC 59 Medical Missionaries and Community Partners (Fall 2013) | term = 2013 Q3 }}

Today, '''Medical Service Ministries''' (since 1992) is a trust organization that provides support via grants to [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] affiliated applicants who are looking to further their specializations in courses such as [[community health]] and [[tropical medicine]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b"&gt;''Medical service ministries.'' [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to 1992, Medical Service Ministries was known as the Missionary School of Medicine (1903-1992) and provided homeopathic training to Christian missionaries who found that they were ill-equipped to help themselves and others in a tropical climate.&lt;ref&gt;The papers of the Medical Service Ministries including minutes, student records, student fellowship files, publications and photographs are held by [https://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/collections/a-z/m/ SOAS Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; MSM was formed through the collaborative efforts of the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] and the [[British Homeopathic Association]] in 1903. 
While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. This spurred the Missionary School of Medicine to be renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. The implications behind the word “[[missionary]]” were thought to be driving students away.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries"&gt;Davies, A. E. (2007). The history of MSM—homeopathy and natural medicines. [http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/download/The%20History%20of%20MSM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increasing cost of running the school coupled with the demands brought on by qualifications required by many developing countries at this time caused MSM to close the school portion of the organization (1996) in order to become strictly a [[trust fund]] for funding applicants supported by [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian communities/organizations]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Background ==

During the 19th century, many [[missionary|missionaries]] sought to expand trade and spread the Christian gospel in the developing [[British colonies]]. However, many found that they were ill-equipped in the tropical climate; many missionaries and their families became ill. Due to this lack of medical knowledge, many missionaries returned to England to receive [[first aid]] training at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a"&gt;Price, P. (2003). In Cousins A. J. (Ed.), ''Touching the ends of the earth: The story of medical service ministries.'' {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022605/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/resources/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} United Kingdom: Medical Service Ministries.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a supporter of the newly formed [[British Homeopathic Association]], the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] was one such place that offered to train missionaries in first aid. The [[British Homeopathic Association|British Homeopathic Association’s]] Educational Committee ran these trainings in partnership with the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. Lectures were offered in both basic medicine and surgery.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
Finding increased interest from returning missionaries, in the autumn of 1903, the Missionary School of Medicine was opened at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to accommodate the training. Upon its opening, Dr. Edwin A. Neatby became the first Dean of the Missionary School of Medicine, presiding over the 24 students enrolled in the school’s first class.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;

== Mission and Work ==

=== Organization===

The Missionary School of Medicine was organized   with a President, and  a general council.&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; There were additionally a treasurer and a warden, responsible for both running the school day-to-day and teaching nursing procedures,

Presidents of the school include Edwin A. Neatby (beginning in 1903), H. Dodd (beginning in 1952), and Kathleen Priestman (serving from 1981-1991).&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;

[[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was a notable treasurer for the Missionary School of Medicine due to his contributions to the formation of the school’s [[financial endowment|endowment fund]].&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; Wardens that served at the school include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* Miss Goodwin (1903-1934)
* Miss Elizabeth Bargh (1934-1965)
* Miss Lyle Bottom (1965-1980)
* Mrs. Jean Hayward-Lynch (1980-1996)

The teaching staff included homeopathic physicians  experienced in [[tropical medicine]] and other specialties. M  Some of the teaching staff and their subjects include:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;
* Children’s diseases: Donald Foubister and Kathleen Priestman
* Skin diseases: Alva Benjamin
* General medicine: Charles Wheeler, John MacKillop, [[Queenie Muriel Francis Adams|Muriel Adams]]
* Surgery: W Eldon Tucker and P Cutner
* Dentistry: N E Gillham
* Podiatry: J N LeRossignol

=== Teaching Program&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The teaching program was delivered over the course of three terms. Early course offerings included lectures in basic medicine and surgery, and later expanded to the other medical areas, as well as to   Homeopathic pharmacy
The goal of the curriculum was to enable missionaries to care for themselves, their families, and others when abroad and when there was no additional medical aid available.

Lectures were held at [[Wellcome Collection|The Wellcome Museum]] as well as at the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]]. The [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] also allowed students at their clinics and to study there. Further, [[St. John Ambulance|St. John’s Ambulance Association]] taught first aid at the school.

Upon graduation from the school, graduates received both homeopathic remedies and certificates. The remedies were donated by homeopathic pharmacies that were involved in teaching at the school, and were given to the graduates to take with them on their missions.

=== Finances&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

In the early 1900s, the “Scholarship Fund” was formed by Reverend Omri Jenkins. It was hoped that an endowment fund could be created from this to cover costs of running the school. The treasurer was responsible for overseeing this fund. Treasurer [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] was particularly successful in gathering donations for the fund, attracting funds through private connections.

In addition to these funds, student fees were used to help cover the cost of running the school. Since student fees were kept low, they never could fully cover the cost of running the school. Here is a progression of the student fees at the school:&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt;
* 1909-1926: full-time course cost six guineas per student
* 1950s: one term cost 30 guineas per student
* 1978: one term cost £50 per student
* 1979-1980: one term cost £400 per student (only 15 students enrolled)

=== Students&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Most students were sponsored by the [[Mission (Christianity)|Missionary Societies]] that sent them abroad. MSM students were supported by 115 different Societies.

Many different countries were represented in MSM. From the 1960s to the 1970s, students came from England, Japan, Norway, Germany, and Korea. In the 1980s, students also came from Angola, the Netherlands, Indonesia, South America, Finland, India, Kenya, Spain, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland.

In the first 50 years of the school, class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. In later years, class sizes were much less, averaging to about 10 students or less per class.

=== Graduates&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

Upon graduating from the school, many graduates went abroad to serve in places including Africa, Japan, South America, India, and Iceland. Supported by home churches and [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] organizations, many graduates set up clinics in the places where they served. Often, the clinics and Mission hospitals in which MSM graduates worked formed the basic network for the development of healthcare in many countries.

=== Homeopathy and Natural Medicines&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

''Main articles: [[Homeopathy]]

[[Homeopathy]] and natural medicine were the focus of the studies of the students at MSM.

Two main principles guide the use of medicine in homeopathy: the Similia Principle and the Dose. The Similia Principle states that a substance that can cause a symptom complex in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. The Dose states that the quantity of medicine used should be the smallest possible to affect a cure and should not be repeated as long as improvement lasts. 
In addition, MSM focused on the use of natural medicine. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both [[traditional medicine|traditional]] and [[modern medicine]]. [[Traditional medicine]] refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. [[Modern medicine]] refers to the use of drugs that are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.

=== MSM Moves&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1925, the [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] found that it needed the study room it lent to MSM as a place for it to train its own nurses. As a result, the school moved from [[London Homeopathic Hospital]] to 2 Powis Place, where it remained until it closed in 1996.

=== Aims of the School&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

In 1936, [[John Weir (physician)|John Weir]] (treasurer), stated the aims of the Missionary School of Medicine:
# To enable missionaries to look after their own health.
# To enable missionaries to nurse and treat one another on the mission field when ill or miles away from medical aid.
# To enable missionaries to start dispensaries for the local people and so open the door for the gospel tidings.

=== A New Name for MSM&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

While class size was always relatively small, the 1990s showed particularly small class size. Leaders in the school assumed that lack of interest could be attributed to the implications of the word “[[missionary]]” in modern day culture. As a result, the Missionary School of Medicine was renamed Medical Service Ministries in 1992. One goal of the renaming was to attract more students to take their 10-week summer courses. However, as class size did not show a significant improvement, the school closed in 1996.

== Closing of the School and Conversion to a Trust ==

=== From School to Trust&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

The 1990s showed a major development in the health ministries of emerging nations, like Africa. As a result, these developing nations requested that those offering medical treatment have required registered qualifications. In order to provide academically recognized qualifications, Medical Service Ministries found that it would have to merge with a university. However, since class sizes were so small and the cost to run the school was only increasing, Medical Service Ministries decided to discontinue training in 1996.

When the school closed, investment income was transferred to the Scholarship Fund, reducing administration costs. As a result, with the work of the Administrator of Trust, Mrs. Glennis Powling, Medical Service Ministries was able to make its financial resources available to fund applicants traveling elsewhere.

=== MSM Today&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries" /&gt; ===

As a grant-making trust, Medical Service Ministries provides grants to candidates undertaking specialist training in these areas:
* Child health
* [[Community health]]care
* Disaster relief
* [[Midwifery]]
* [[Palliative care]]
* Travel and [[tropical medicine]]

In addition, MSM generally considers funding applicants who are primary healthcare trainers or workers in impoverished areas of underdeveloped countries. Further, applicants must show evidence of sponsorship or support of a [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian mission]] or local community.

One example of a [[trust fund]] applicant success story can be found in Tamara Filmer, a [[missionary]] working in rural, undeveloped Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Filmer, T. "Training to forecast!" {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528025417/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/02/training-to-forecast/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Filmer writes:

''“With MSM’s assistance I was able to attend training in logistics and management regarding pharmaceuticals.  In December 2012, I travelled from the mid-west of Nepal to India’s capital, Delhi, to attend a two-week course entitled “International Procurement and Supply Chain Management”.  I walked away with a suitcase of information and resources! ... I want to thank Medical Service Ministries and their supporters for the funding that enabled me to attend this course.  On our missionary living allowance, it just wouldn’t have been possible to afford the course, so I am grateful for this opportunity.”''

=== Mission Statement&lt;ref name="medicalserviceministries_a" /&gt; ===

The current mission statement of Medical Service Ministries is as follows:

''“To encourage full-time Christian workers in the UK and elsewhere to prepare for Personal and Community Healthcare work in the developing world, in association with Christian organizations, and to witness to their faith in obedience to Christ’s command to preach and heal. Funding is available for approved healthcare candidates.”''

Recently retired treasurer, Brian Weller, shows that this mission statement is alive in the everyday actions of MSM and its leadership when he states:&lt;ref&gt;Weller, B. "MSM's third treasurer in 107 years stands down." {{cite web |url=http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528022746/http://medicalserviceministries.org.uk/2013/05/msms-third-treasurer-in-107-years-stands-down/ |archivedate=2014-05-28 |df= }} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
''“It is my belief that overseas Christian service in response to Our Lord’s commission to preach and heal calls for continued effort and support, and will not lack His supply as we rise to the challenge.  Our vision is to make healthcare accessible and to raise standards.  It will continue to be achieved through individuals called by God to play their part here at home and overseas.”''

== History ==
The term "molecular epidemiology" was first coined by Kilbourne in a 1973 article entitled "The molecular epidemiology of influenza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kilbourne ED |title=The molecular epidemiology of influenza |journal=J Infect Dis |date=Apr 1973 |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=478–87 |pmid=4121053 |doi=10.1093/infdis/127.4.478}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more formalized with the formulation of the first book on ''Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice'' by Schulte and Perera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Molecular Epidemiology: Principles and Practice |last1=Schulte |first1= Paul A. |last2=Perera |first2=Frederica P. |year=1993 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=0-12-632346-1 |pages=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the heart of this book is the impact of advances in molecular research that have given rise to and enable the measurement and exploitation of the [[biomarker]] as a vital tool to link traditional molecular and epidemiological research strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in populations.

== Modern use ==
While most molecular epidemiology studies are using conventional disease designation system for an outcome (with the use of exposures at the molecular level), compelling evidence indicates that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous process differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual ("the unique disease principle"),&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, Nishihara R, Cho E, Wolpin BM, Meyerhardt AJ, Meissner A, Schernhammer ES, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E. Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease. Mod Pathol 2013;26:465-484.&lt;/ref&gt; considering uniqueness of the [[exposome]] and its unique influence on [[Molecular pathology|molecular pathologic]] process in each individual. Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman ME, Howatt W, Blows FM, Pharoah P, Hewitt SM, Garcia-Closas M. Molecular pathology in epidemiologic studies: a primer on key considerations. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2010;19(4):966-972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science. Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:659-667.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "molecular epidemiology" for this type of research masked the presence of these challenges, and hindered the development of methods and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Kuller LH. Invited commentary: the 21st century epidemiologist--a need for different training? Am J Epidemiol 2012;176(8):668-671.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogino S, Beck AH, King EE, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E. Ogino et al. respond to "The 21st century epidemiologist". Am J Epidemiol 2012;176:672-674.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the premise that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes.

== Analytical methods ==
The genome of a bacterial species fundamentally determines its identity. Thus, [[gel electrophoresis]] techniques like [[pulsed-field gel electrophoresis]] can be used in molecular epidemiology to comparatively analyze patterns of bacterial chromosomal fragments and to elucidate the genomic content of bacterial cells. Due to its widespread use and ability to analyse epidemiological information about most bacterial pathogens based on their molecular markers, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is relied upon heavily in molecular epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Goering, R.|title= Pulsed field gel electrophoresis: A review of application and interpretation in the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease |journal= Infection, Genetics and Evolution |date= 6 August 2010 |volume= 10|issue= 7 |pages= 866–875|pmid= 20692376|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2010.07.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Molecular epidemiology allows for an understanding of the molecular outcomes and implications of diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposure, particularly how these choices and exposures result in acquired genetic mutations and how these mutations are distributed throughout selected populations through the use of biomarkers and genetic information. Molecular epidemiological studies are able to provide additional understanding of previously-identified [[risk factor]]s and disease mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific applications include:
* Molecular surveillance of disease risk factors
* Measuring the geographical and temporal distribution of disease risk factors
* Characterizing the evolution of pathogens and classifying new pathogen species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2014|title=Strengthening the Reporting of Molecular Epidemiology for Infectious Diseases (STROME-ID): an extension of the STROBE statement|journal=Lancet Infect Dis|volume=14|issue=4|pages=341–352|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70324-4|pmid=24631223|author=Field, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
While the use of advanced molecular analysis techniques within the field of molecular epidemiology is providing the larger field of epidemiology with greater means of analysis, [[Miquel Porta]] identified several challenges that the field of molecular epidemiology faces, particularly selecting and incorporating requisite applicable data in an unbiased manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Incomplete overlapping of biological, clinical, and environmental information in molecular epidemiological studies: a variety of causes and a cascade of consequences|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=734–738|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.734|pmid=1732039|author=Porta, M.|pmc=1732039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations of molecular epidemiological studies are similar in nature to those of generic epidemiological studies, that is, samples of convenience - both of the target population and genetic information, small sample sizes, inappropriate statistical methods, poor quality control, and poor definition of target populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=The science and art of molecular epidemiology|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=56|issue=10|pages=728–729|doi=10.1136/jech.56.10.728|pmid=1732025|author=Slattery, M.|pmc=1732025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Montia fontana''''', commonly known as '''blinks''' or '''water blinks''', '''water chickweed''' or '''annual water miner's lettuce''', is a herbaceous annual plant of the genus ''[[Montia]]''. It is a common plant that can be found in wet environments around the globe, from the [[tropics]] to the [[Arctic]]. It is quite variable in morphology, taking a variety of forms. It is sometimes [[aquatic plant|aquatic]].

Montia fontana is divided into four subspecies, subsp. fontana, subsp. amporitana, subsp. chondrosperma and subsp. variabilis&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D. M. 1963. The subspecies of Montia fontana L. Bot. Not. 116: 16-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters, S. M. 1953. Montia fontana L. Watsonia 3: 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Age Orientalism''' describes a modern, Western perception of [[Tibet]], and other Asian majority countries. The term was coined by, [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Swell Lopez Jr.]], who specializes in Western discourse on [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez Jr|first=Donald Sewell|date=1994|title=New age orientalism: the case of Tibet|url=|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Journal|volume=3|pages=36–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/asian/people/faculty/dlopez.html|title=Donald S.

It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Lhoba people|Lhoba peoples]] and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibet|date=2018-08-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibet&amp;oldid=856854724|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Orientalism on Tibet'''==

[[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Dr. Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing throughout history. He found that, before the New Age movement, the depiction of Tibet was often cynical and derogatory. The demeaning features that define Orientalism, characterized the portrayal of Tibet, before the emergence of New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Self-aggrandizing of the Orient ===
In line with the logic of opposites, members of Western academia stressed their superiority (particularly regarding their academic abilities) and used this as a justification to patronize the Orient. With the modern period came Colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world sparked western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions, despite having a sparse and incomplete understanding of them. The Western world, a majority of which was engaging in colonialism, considered The Eastern world to be incapable of representing itself due to its non-western mechanisms of knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized and valuable way of expression, and so western academics took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet, from their perspectives. Often described as 'backward' or 'incapable,' particularly in self-governance, such portrayals helped to fuel racist and white supremacist beliefs of Asian peoples across the west. Such western scholars considered both China and Tibet to be “Oriental Despotisms,” to which the politically organized and colonizing Western world was meant to civilize. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Gaining and justifying authority ===
[[Manifest destiny]], along with larger ideologies of [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]], were used as a method of justifying imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Eve|date=2016|title=Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film|url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&amp;amp=&amp;context=jrf&amp;amp=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.de%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Dde%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253D%252522new%252Bage%252BOrientalism%252522%252Bmullen%2526oq%253Dmull#search=%22new%20age%20Orientalism%20mullen%22|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Film|volume=2.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When control of Tibet was taken by western forces for periods of time, western understandings of self-superiority helped to fuel the sense of entitlement, which explained such [[Colonialism|colonial violence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, despite [[British expedition to Tibet|Britain]] and [[Foreign relations of Tibet#Russia and The Great Game|Russia's]] considerable military efforts. According to a western-centric understanding, Tibet never [[Modernization theory|modernized,]] refusing to adopt European-style education systems or norms. Throughout the course of the 19th and 20th century, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers, and was therefore predominantly portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=='''New Age Orientalism and Tibet'''==

Embedded in the [[New Age|New Age movement]], New Age Orientalism describes the positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet|Chinese invasion 1950]] and [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan diaspora 1959)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This portrayal of Tibet in the modern Western Societies, has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting negative aspects of its society, such as, violence or the clerical, feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuqayOx2Nw|title=Colin Goldner: Hinter dem Lächeln des Dalai Lama (Vortrag Univ.

New Age Orientalism, subsequently, describes the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] perception of Tibet, in which Tibet is no longer depreciated but, rather, romanticized. It is based on the tradition of continued [[Romantic Orientalism]], “in which the ‘West’ perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the ‘East.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variation. The logic of opposites, now relates to the old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated, "oriental despotism," but as a [[Shangri-La]] -- positive, holy, pristine, and pure, which is perceived as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute the opposite, as the evil, subhuman force invading the land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. The old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This allows the West to aggrandize themselves as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism (see [[Free Tibet|'Free Tibet']] movement), whereas, [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are depicted as helpless and voiceless. Ultimately, the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== New Age Orientalism in popular culture ===

The romanticized picture of Tibet has, partly, been constructed and reflected by [[popular culture]]. Hollywood movies such as [[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven years in Tibet]], [[Kundun]], and [[Little Buddha]], were found to draw a [[Romanticism|romanticized]] image of Tibet, and hold up the Western rescue paradigm, in line with the play of opposites, between China and Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, publications surrounding the '[[Free Tibet]]' movement have been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The constructed fantasies of a Shangri-La Tibet, are found to reflect back on the Western struggles, within their own national identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, pitfalls of [[Globalization|globalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=='''Expansion of New Age Orientialism'''==

In academic literature, the concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions, such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt; The discourse and perception on [[Ayurveda]], for instance, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=='''Criticism of New Age Orientialism'''==

Dr. Donald Lopez's concept of New Age Orientalism, has been criticized for placing too much weight on the impact and power of Orientalism, and viewing Tibet as a closed totality, removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreyfus|first=Georges|date=2005|title=Are We Prisoners of Shangrila?

A '''non-communicable disease''' ('''NCD''') is a [[disease]] that is not [[transmission (medicine)|transmissible]] directly from one person to another. NCDs include [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[stroke]]s, most [[heart disease]]s, most [[cancer]]s, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cataract]]s, and others. NCDs may be [[chronic condition|chronic]] or [[acute (medicine)|acute]]. Most are non-[[infection|infectious]], although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as [[parasitic disease]]s in which the parasite's [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] does not include direct host-to-host transmission. 

NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, they caused 68% of all deaths (38 million) up from 60% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half were under age 70 and half were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noncommunicable diseases |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/topics/noncommunicable_diseases/en/ |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of [[high blood pressure]].

== Risk factors ==
[[Risk factor]]s such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, [[gender]], [[genetics]], exposure to [[air pollution]], and behaviors such as [[smoking]], [[Healthy diet|unhealthy diet]] and [[Sedentary lifestyle|physical inactivity]] which can lead to [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.

The WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2002'']] identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised [[cholesterol]], tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the "[social determinants of health]."

It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and [[type 2 diabetes]] and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .

==Environmental diseases==
NCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable [[health|human health]] conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices.  The [[diseases of affluence]] are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes.  Examples include:
* Many types of [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD)
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]
* [[Lower back pain]] caused by too little exercise
* [[Malnutrition]] caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. [[scurvy]] from lack of [[Vitamin C]])
* [[Skin cancer]] caused by radiation from the sun
* [[Obesity]]

=== Inherited diseases ===
{{See also|List of genetic disorders}}
[[Genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.
The origin of these genetic errors can be:
* Spontaneous errors or mutations to the [[genome]]:
:* A change in chromosome [[Chromosomal condition|numbers]], such as [[Down syndrome]].
:* A defect in a gene caused by [[mutation]], such as [[Cystic fibrosis]].
:* An increase in the [[Mosaic (genetics)|amount]] of genetic information, such as [[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] or [[Heterochromia iridum|Heterochromia]].

Cystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene. The faulty gene impairs the normal movement of sodium chloride in and out of cells, which causes the mucus-secreting organs to produce abnormally thick mucus. The gene is recessive, meaning that a person must have two copies of the faulty gene for them to develop the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as the sweat glands. The mucus secreted is very thick and blocks passageways in the lungs and digestive tracts. This mucus causes problems with breathing and with the digestion and absorption of nutrients.
* Inherited genetic errors from [[Kinship#Descent and the family|parents]]:
:* [[Dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] genetic diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], require the inheritance of [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|one]] erroneous gene to be expressed.
:* [[Recessive]] genetic diseases require the inheritance of erroneous genes to be expressed and this is one reason they work together.

== Global health ==

Referred to as a "lifestyle" disease, because the majority of these diseases are preventable illnesses, the most common causes for non-communicable diseases (NCD) include tobacco use (smoking), alcohol abuse, poor diets (high consumption of sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fatty acids) and physical inactivity. Currently, NCD kills 36 million people a year, a number that by some estimates is expected to rise by 17–24% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-Communicable Diseases Deemed Development Challenge of ‘Epidemic Proportions’ in Political Declaration Adopted During Landmark General Assembly Summit |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/ga11138.doc.htm |date=19 September 2011 |website=United Nations |publisher=Department of Public Information |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many NCDs were associated with economic development and were so-called a "[[diseases of affluence|diseases of the rich]]". The burden of non-communicable diseases in developing countries has increased however, with an estimated 80% of the four main types of NCDs — cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes — now occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of non-communicable Diseases and with two-thirds of people who are affected by diabetes now residing in developing nations, NCD can no longer be considered just a problem affecting affluent estimation of the economic impact of chronic non-communicable diseases in selected countries. New WHO report: deaths from non-communicable diseases are on the rise, with developing world hit hardest. As previously stated, in 2008 alone, NCD's were the cause of  63% of deaths worldwide; a number that is expected to rise considerably in the near future if measures are not taken.

If present growth trends are maintained, by 2020, NCDs will attribute to 7 out of every 10 deaths in developing countries, killing 52 million people annually worldwide by 2030. With statistics such as these, it comes as no surprise that international entities such as the World Health Organization &amp; World Bank Human Development Network have identified the prevention and control of NCDs as an increasingly important discussion item on the [[global health]] agenda.

Thus, should policy makers and communities mobilize "and make prevention and targeted treatment of such diseases a priority," sustainable measures can be implemented to stagnate (and eventually even reverse) this emerging global health threat.  Potential measures currently being discussed by the(World Health Organization)-Food and Agriculture Organization includes reducing the levels of salt in foods, limiting inappropriate marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, imposing controls on harmful alcohol use, raising taxes on tobacco, and curbing legislation to curb smoking in public places.

=== United Nations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] is the specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] (UN) that acts as coordinating authority on international [[public health]] issues, including NCDs. In May 2008, the 193 Member States of the WHO approved a six-year plan to address non-communicable diseases, especially the rapidly increasing burden in low- and middle-income countries. The plan calls for raising the priority given to NCDs in [[international development]] work'.

During the 64th session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2010, a resolution was passed to call for a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and treatment NCDs with the participation of heads of state and government. The resolution also encouraged UN Member States to address the issue of non-communicable diseases at the 2010 Review Summit for the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

=== Global Non-communicable Disease Network ===
In order to better coordinate efforts around the globe, in 2009 the WHO announced the launch of the ''Global Non-communicable Disease Network'' (NCDnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New network to combat noncommunicable diseases |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/noncommunicable_diseases_20090708/en/index.html |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCDnet will consist of leading health organizations and experts from around the world in order to fight against diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Ala Alwan, assistant director-general for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health at the WHO, said: "integrating the prevention of non-communicable diseases and injuries into the national and global development agendas is not only achievable but also a priority for developing countries."&lt;ref name="Business"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's action against non-communicable diseases|author=Alexander Chiejina|newspaper=Business Day Weekend |date=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NCD Alliance ===
The NCD Alliance is a global partnership founded in May 2009 by four international federations representing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]]. The NCD Alliance brings together roughly 900 national member associations to fight non-communicable disease. Long term aims of the Alliance include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdalliance.org/aboutus |title=About Us |author=The NCD Alliance |publisher=The NCD Alliance |accessdate=4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504050001/http://ncdalliance.org/aboutus |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases (UNIATF) ===
The [[United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs|United Nations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases]] (UNIATF) was established by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in 2013 in order to provide scaled up action across the UN system to support governments, in particular in low- and middle-income countries, to tackle [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs).

=== Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network ===
The Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network, or commonly referred to as YP-CDN, is a global network of roughly 5000 young professionals across 157 countries. The organization aims to mobilize these young people "to take action against social injustice driven by NCDs.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdaction.org/history|title=History |author=YP-CDN |publisher=YP-CDN |accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==
Previously, chronic NCDs were considered a problem limited mostly to [[high income economy|high income countries]], while [[infectious diseases]] seemed to affect [[low income countries]]. The burden of disease attributed to NCDs has been estimated at 85% in industrialized nations, 70% in middle income nations, and nearly 50% in countries with the lowest national incomes.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Preventing Chronic Diseases a Vital Investment |journal=Cataloguing-in-Publication Data |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, chronic NCDs accounted for more than 60% (over 35 million) of the 57 million deaths worldwide. Given the global population distribution, almost 80% of deaths due to chronic NCDs worldwide now occur in low and middle income countries, while only 20% occur in higher income countries.

National economies are reportedly suffering significant losses because of premature deaths or inability to work resulting from heart disease, stroke and diabetes. For instance, China is expected to lose roughly $558 billion in national income between 2005 and 2015 due to early deaths. In 2005, heart disease, stroke and diabetes caused an estimated loss in [[international dollar]]s of national income of 9 billion in India and 3 billion in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHO2005"/&gt;

=== Absenteeism and presenteeism ===
{{main | Absenteeism | Presenteeism}}

The burden of chronic NCDs including [[mental health]] conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to elevated levels of [[absenteeism]], or absence from work because of illness, and [[presenteeism]], or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor [[health]]. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper C, Dewe P |title=Well-being—absenteeism, presenteeism, costs and challenges |journal=Occup Med (Lond) |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=522–4 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19054749 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn124|last2=Dewe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost due to presenteeism is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of presenteeism are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.

== Key diseases ==

=== Cancer ===
{{main | Cancer}}

For the vast majority of cancers, risk factors are environmental or lifestyle-related, thus cancers are mostly preventable NCD.&lt;ref name=Danaei&gt;{{cite journal |author= Danaei G, Vander Hoorn S, Lopez AD, Murray CJ, Ezzati M |title= Causes of cancer in the world: comparative risk assessment of nine behavioural and environmental risk factors |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9499 |pages=1784–93 |year=2005 |pmid=16298215 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67725-2|last2= Vander Hoorn |last3= Lopez |last4= Murray |last5= Ezzati |author6= Comparative Risk Assessment collaborating group (Cancers) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater than 30% of cancer is preventable via avoiding risk factors including: [[tobacco]], being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]], low fruit and vegetable intake, [[physical inactivity]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/ |title=Cancer |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Infectious agents are responsible for some cancers, for instance almost all [[cervical cancer]]s are caused by [[human papillomavirus]] infection.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
{{main | Cardiovascular disease}}

The first studies on cardiovascular health were performed in 1949 by [[Jerry Morris]] using occupational health data and were published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris JN, Crawford MD |title=Coronary heart disease and physical activity of work; evidence of a national necropsy survey |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5111 |pages=1485–96 |date=December 1958 |pmid=13608027 |pmc=2027542 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5111.1485|last2=Crawford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of [[biomedical research]], with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis. A trend has emerged, particularly in the early 2000s, in which numerous studies have revealed a link between fast food and an increase in heart disease. These studies include those conducted by the Ryan Mackey Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health. Many major fast food chains, particularly McDonald's, have protested the methods used in these studies and have responded with healthier menu options.

A fairly recent emphasis is on the link between low-grade [[inflammation]] that hallmarks atherosclerosis and its possible interventions. [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) is a common inflammatory marker that has been found to be present in increased levels in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20024640|year=2009|last1=Karakas|first1=M|last2=Koenig|first2=W|title=CRP in cardiovascular disease|volume=34|issue=8|pages=607–13|doi=10.1007/s00059-009-3305-7|journal=Herz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[osteoprotegerin]] which involved with regulation of a key inflammatory transcription factor called [[NF-κB]] has been found to be a risk factor of cardiovascular disease and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20448212|year=2010|last1=Lieb|first1=W|last2=Gona|first2=P|last3=Larson|first3=MG|last4=Massaro|first4=JM|last5=Lipinska|first5=I|last6=Keaney Jr|first6=JF|last7=Rong|first7=J|last8=Corey|first8=D|last9=Hoffmann|first9=U|last10=Fox|first10=C.

=== Diabetes ===
{{main | Diabetes}}

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition which is largely preventable and manageable but difficult to cure.  Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal ("euglycemia") as possible without presenting undue [[patient]] danger.  This can usually be with close dietary management, exercise, and use of appropriate medications (insulin only in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Oral medications may be used in the case of type 2 diabetes, as well as insulin).

Patient education, understanding, and participation is vital since the complications of diabetes are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.&lt;!--

Wider health problems may accelerate the deleterious effects of diabetes. These include [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] levels, [[obesity]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and lack of regular [[exercise]].

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
{{main|Chronic kidney disease}}

Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not currently identified as one of WHO's main targets for global NCD control, there is compelling evidence that CKD is not only common, harmful and treatable but also a major contributing factor to the incidence and outcomes of at least three of the diseases targeted by WHO (diabetes, hypertension and CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang |first=Q.L. |last2=Rothenbacher |first2=D. |title=Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in population-based studies: systematic review|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-8-117 |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=8 |pages=117 |year=2008 |pmid=18405348 |pmc=2377260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CKD strongly predisposes to hypertension and CVD; diabetes, hypertension and CVD are all major causes of CKD; and major risk factors for diabetes, hypertension and CVD (such as obesity and smoking) also cause or exacerbate CKD. In addition, among people with diabetes, hypertension, or CVD, the subset who also have CKD are at highest risk of adverse outcomes and high health care costs. Thus, CKD, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are closely associated conditions that often coexist; share common risk factors and treatments; and would benefit from a coordinated global approach to prevention and control.

=== Chronic respiratory disease ===
''Main Article: [[Respiratory disease#Chronic respiratory disease|Chronic respiratory disease]]''

Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are diseases of the lungs and airways.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO) hundreds of millions of people suffer daily from CRDs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/about_topic/en/|title=WHO {{!}} About chronic respiratory diseases|website=www.who.int|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common CRDs are: [[Asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Occupational lung disease]], and [[Pulmonary hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/en/|title=Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While CRDs are not curable, various treatments are available to help improve quality of life for individuals who have them.  Most treatments involve dilating major airways to improve shortness of breath among other symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The main risk factors for developing CRDs are: tobacco smoking, indoor and outdoor air pollution, allergens, and occupational risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO helped launch the [[Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases]] (GARD) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GARD is voluntarily composed of national and international organizations and works toward "reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases" and focus mainly on vulnerable populations and low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/respiratory/gard/en/|title=Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health''' (PMNCH) is a multi-constituency partnership hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] and chaired by [[Graça Machel]]. PMNCH seeks to achieve universal access to comprehensive, high-quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. PMNCH works with more than 650 members in the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) communities across seven constituencies:

# Academic research and teaching institutions 
# Donors and foundations
# Health-care professionals
# Multilateral agencies
# Non-governmental organizations 
# Partner countries 
# The private sector

PMNCH describes itself as "a platform for knowledge, advocacy and accountability to improve women and children’s health". The Partnership is governed by a Board chaired by [[Graça Machel]].

==Main Activities==

The Partnership plays a central role in facilitating joint action on many fronts, mainly progress towards the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5, to
reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, as tracked by  the Countdown to 2015
initiative, and through support for the [[Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health|Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health]] (Global Strategy) and Every Woman Every Child. PMNCH enables members to share
strategies, align objectives and resources, and collectively agree on policy interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching Every Woman and Every Child through Partnership|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/20130620_pmnchbrochurelowres.pdf?ua=1|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMNCH’s work and support to partners is focused on three key Strategic Objectives: 
# Promotion of knowledge and innovation for action in order to enhance policy, service delivery and financing mechanisms.  
# Advocacy to mobilize and consolidate resources and greater engagement towards RMNCH.  
# Promotion of accountability for resources and results in order to strengthen monitoring of RMNCH’s efforts.

The Partnership issues annual reports on progress of commitments from more than 250 stakeholders and estimates that the Global Strategy has leveraged over US$18 billion in new and additional money for women’s and children’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PMNCH 2013 Report|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/2013_pmnch_report/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PMNCH was launched in September 2005 when the world’s three leading maternal, newborn and child health alliances joined forces under the new name of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health. 80 original members joined together from the three organizations, which included: the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health, hosted by the World Health Organization in Geneva; the Healthy Newborn Partnership, based at [[Save the Children]] USA; and the Child Survival Partnership, hosted by [[Unicef|UNICEF]] in New York. All three partnerships focused on accelerating action by countries—both donor and
developing countries—to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 ([[Child mortality|reduce child
mortality]]) and 5 ([[Maternal health|improve maternal health]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PMNCH History|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/history/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board Members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board, PMNCH|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/governance/board/en/|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

As of July 2014, the following bodies are represented on the PMNCH Board. The Board is chaired by Mrs Graça Machel and co-chaired by Mr CK Mishra, [[Government of India]] and Dr Flavia Bustreo, the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairs, PMNCH|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/governance/board/chairs/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poa pratensis''''', commonly known as '''Kentucky bluegrass''' (or '''blue grass'''), '''smooth meadow-grass''', or '''common meadow-grass''', is a [[perennial]] species of [[Poaceae|grass]] native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America. The Spanish brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/turf/publications/Bluegrass.html|title=Kentucky Bluegrass |publisher=Aggie Horticulture|author=Martin Anderson, Texas AgriLife Extension Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poa pratensis'' forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making [[lawn]]s in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ksenija Vujnovic |author2=Ross W. Wein |date=September 1997 |title=An Inventory of Remnant Prairie Grasslands Within the Central Parkland Natural Sub-Region of Alberta |url=https://www.albertaparks.ca/media/3195225/parkland_report_remnant_prairie.pdf |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Poa pratensis'' was one of the many species described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his landmark work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753. ''Poa'' is [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] for [[fodder]] and ''pratensis'' is derived from ''pratum'', the [[Latin]] for [[meadow]]. The name Kentucky bluegrass derives from its flower heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dag Ryen (letter to the editor) |date=June 3, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/03/opinion/l-what-makes-kentucky-s-bluegrass-blue-528593.html |title=What Makes Kentucky's Bluegrass Blue |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=22 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Poa pratensis'' is the [[type (botany)|type species]] of the grass family [[Poaceae]].

There are two ill-defined subspecies:
*''Poa pratensis'' [[ssp.]] ''pratensis'' – temperate regions
*''Poa pratensis'' ssp. ''colpodea'' – Arctic

==Description==
''Poa pratensis'' is a [[herbaceous]] perennial plant {{convert|30|–|70|cm}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] have boat-shaped tips, narrowly linear, up to {{convert|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|3|–|5|mm}} broad, smooth or slightly roughened, with a rounded to truncate ligule {{convert|1|–|2|mm}} long. The conical [[panicle]] is {{convert|5|–|20|cm|sigfig=1}} long, with 3 to 5 branches in the basal whorls; the oval [[spikelet]]s are {{convert|3|–|6|mm}} long with 2 to 5 [[floret]]s, and are purplish-green or grey. They are in flower from May to July, compared to annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') which is in flower for eight months of the year. ''Poa pratensis'' has a fairly prominent mid-vein (center of the blade).

The [[ligule]] is extremely short and square ended, making a contrast with annual meadowgrass (''[[Poa annua]]'') and rough meadowgrass (''[[Poa trivialis]]'') in which it is silvery and pointed. The Kentucky bluegrass is a dark green/blue compared to the apple-green color of ''Poa annua'' and ''Poa trivialis''.

The [[rootstock]] is creeping, with runners ([[rhizome]]s). The broad, blunt leaves tend to spread at the base, forming close mats.

==Ecology==
[[File:PP Na Popovickem kopci 007 cf Myrmus miriformis.jpg|thumb|''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'' in the [[Olomouc Region]]]]
This species is among the food plants of the caterpillars of the [[meadow brown]] (''Maniola jurtina'') and [[Gatekeeper (butterfly)|gatekeeper]] (''Pyronia tithonus'') butterflies; the common sun beetle (''[[Amara aenea]]'') (adults feed on the developing seeds), ''Eupelix cuspidata'' of the [[leafhopper]] family, and ''[[Myrmus miriformis]]'', a grassbug (feeds on young blades and developing seeds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php Natural England description on website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223215305/http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o1084-roughmeadowgrass.php |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation and production==
Since the 1950s and early 1960s, 90% of Kentucky bluegrass seed in the United States has been produced on specialist farms in [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

During the 1990s botanists began experimenting with hybrids of ''Poa pratensis'' and Texas bluegrass (''[[Poa arachnifera|P. arachnifera]]''), with the goal of creating a [[drought]] and heat-resistant lawn grass.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''Population health''' has been defined as "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kindig D, Stoddart G | date = March 2003 | title = What is population health? | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 380–3 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380 |pmid=12604476 | pmc=1447747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the [[health]] of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations. The World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, reported in 2008, that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/Conference_Report.pdf Meeting Report of World Conference of Social Determinants of Health] held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US, SDOH were estimated to account for 70% of avoidable mortality.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, Knickman JR. 2002.

See also [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10548.html National Academies Press free publication: The Future of Public Health in the 21st Century.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a population health perspective, health has been defined not simply as a state free from disease but as "the capacity of people to adapt to, respond to, or control life's challenges and changes".&lt;ref&gt;Frankish, CJ et al. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ph-sp/impact-repercussions/hiatp2.php "Health Impact Assessment as a Tool for Population Health Promotion and Public Policy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308083354/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ph-sp/impact-repercussions/hiatp2.php |date=8 March 2010 }}. Vancouver: Institute of Health Promotion Research, University of British Columbia, 1996.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81).

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

As participation in value-based reimbursement models such as [[accountable care organization]]s (ACOs) increases, these initiatives will help drive population health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DeVore S, Champion RW |title=Driving Population Health Through Accountable Care Organizations|journal=Health Affairs |year=2011|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–50|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0935|pmid=21209436|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/1/41.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ACO model, hospitals have to meet specific quality benchmarks, focus on prevention, and carefully manage patients with chronic diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Care Organizations, Explained|url = http://khn.org/news/aco-accountable-care-organization-faq/|website = Kaiser Health News|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US|date = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providers get paid more for keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies have shown that inpatient admission rates have dropped over the past ten years in communities that were early adopters of the ACO model and implemented population health measures to treat "less sick" patients in the outpatient setting.&lt;ref&gt;Kutscher B.

Other goals include preventing disease, closing care gaps, and cost savings for providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Population Health Management?|url = http://www.wellcentive.com/what-is-population-health-management/|website = Wellcentive|accessdate = 21 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, more effort has been directed towards developing telehealth services, community-based clinics in areas with high proportion of residents using the emergency department as primary care, and patient care coordinator roles to coordinate healthcare services across the care continuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The economics of health and health care (Vol. 6): Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as obesity and smoking have negative effects on health capital, while education, wage rate, and age may also impact health capital.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When people are healthier through preventative care, they have the potential to live a longer and healthier life, work more and participate in the economy, and produce more based on the work done. These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

An industry involved in the extraction and collection of natural resources, such as copper and timber, as well as by activities such as farming and fishing. A company in a primary industry can also be involved in turning natural resources into products.
Primary industry tends to make up a larger portion of the economy of developing countries than they do for developed countries. See also service industry, secondary industry.
The '''primary sector''' is concerned with the extraction of raw materials. It includes fishing, farming and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary sector of the economy|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/concepts/primary-sector/|website=Economics Help|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary industry is a larger sector in [[developing country|developing countries]]; for instance, [[animal husbandry]] is more common in countries in [[Africa]] than in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2554153|title=Review of The Primary Sector in Economic Development|first=C. D.|last=Scott|date=2 July 1986|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=53|issue=211|pages=414–416|doi=10.2307/2554153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mining in 19th-century [[South Wales]] provides a case study of how an economy can come to rely on one form of activity.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm Mining: it's only a word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123191936/http://business.virgin.net/wales.watch/country/farm2.htm |date=2007-01-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[developed country|developed countries]] the primary industry has become more technologically advanced, for instance the mechanization of farming as opposed to hand picking and planting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS/countries/1W-US-C5?display=graph|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more developed countries, additional capital is invested in primary means of production.  As an example, in the United States' [[corn belt]], [[combine harvester]]s pick the corn, and sprayers spray large amounts of [[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[fungicide]]s, producing a higher yield than is possible using less capital-intensive techniques.  These technological advances and investment allow the primary sector to require less workforce and, this way, developed countries tend to have a smaller percentage of their workforce involved in primary activities, instead having a higher percentage involved in the secondary and tertiary sectors.&lt;ref&gt;H Dwight H. Perkins: Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, Vol. 31, No. 1, China's Developmental Experience (Mar., 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed countries are allowed to maintain and develop their primary industries even further due to the excess wealth. For instance, European Union [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] provide buffers for the fluctuating inflation rates and prices of agricultural [[produce]]. This allows developed countries to be able to export their agricultural products at extraordinarily low prices.  This makes them extremely competitive against those of poor or underdeveloped countries that maintain free market policies and low or non-existent tariffs to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm WTO MINISTERIAL OUTCOME IMBALANCED AGAINST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823085546/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/twninfo339.htm |date=2006-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm Third World Farmers Hit by Unfair Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909232153/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends6.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/international/farmers10-08-2002.htm|title=U.S. subsidies help big business, but crush farmers from developing  countries|author=|date=|website=www.finalcall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such differences also come about due to more efficient production in developed economies, given farm machinery, better information available to farmers, and often larger scale.

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

Rise Against Hunger, [http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article129005999.html formerly Stop Hunger Now], is an international hunger relief non-profit organization that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food and other life-changing aid to people in developing nations. Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 350,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has  distributed more than 315,000,000 meals to recipients in 74 countries with a mission to end hunger in our lifetime.
==History==

Rise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as "Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources."

==Areas of Focus==
Rise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: Nourishing Lives, Responding to Emergencies, Empowering Communities and Growing the Movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world’s most vulnerable populations.   

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/nourishing-lives/ Nourishing Lives]===
Rise Against Hunger supports safety net programs that support nourishment and skills trainings that help the world’s most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with skills trainings and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. Rise Against Hunger works to nourish lives through a holistic approach in the development of the most vulnerable populations.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/responding-to-crisis/ Responding to Emergencies]===
Rise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, to name a few, Rise Against Hunger aims to provide the immediate critical need, food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include the 2016 [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian conflict]], [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudanese conflict]] and [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/empowering-communities/ Empowering Communities]===
In order to create long-term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. Rise Against Hunger works to increase agriculture production and incomes through programs that promote improved agricultural methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/get-involved/ Growing the Movement]===
Part of Rise Against Hunger’s mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. Rise Against Hunger works with volunteer groups from [http://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/local/hearing-the-call-ridgeview-baptist-fights-hunger/article_44250e2a-1cbd-11e7-b13c-db649d8b7886.html communities of faith], [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Kraft-Heinz-expands-CSR-to-hunger-sustainability-environment corporations], [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/milestones-virginia-beach--year-old-organizes-fun-run-food/article_17c83b47-0fd8-5c61-b326-1d82310b7202.html schools] and [http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20170320/local-rotary-clubs-pack-meals-for-rise-against-hunger civic clubs] to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger engages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030.

==Meal packaging program==

The assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by [http://www.heinz.com/sustainability/communities/heinz-micronutrient-campaign.aspx Kraft Heinz Company Foundation] that includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal varies between 29 and 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years.
Rise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much needed nutrition.

==Grant program==

Rise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.

'''''The Flattery Show''''' was the first [[English-language radio]] [[chat show]] aired in the south west of [[France]] and a flagship Sunday evening programme broadcast on [[Radio Coteaux]] in the [[Gascony]] region. The show was presented by Irish radio presenter John Slattery with American co-host Patricia McKinnes. It ran for twenty-one weeks and proved to be very popular with expatriates living in France.

==The show==

Slattery and McKinnes regularly began the show at 5pm and finished at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. ''The Flattery Show'' was a music-based programme that included light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the hosts. Listeners' views and comments were discussed and there were rotating segments such as "Song of The Week", "Ask a Frenchie" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics were picked from a big "Bag O' Topics".

==Invited guests==

The show ran interviews with regular and/or rotating guests, dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first people to be interviewed on the show were the English sisters Marcha King and Sian Cash, former proprietors of the landmark café "Bar Memory" in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] town of [[Castelnau-Magnoac]]. They recounted humorous stories of their years behind the bar at the French café. The interview proved enormously popular with English-speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of jesting and buffoonery that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

==Regular contributors==

The show relied heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that was then read out on air. Most of the regular contributors were local expatriates living in the Gascony region.

==The end==

The show ran for twenty-one weeks in the early months of 2011. When it ceased, Radio Coteaux's Sunday evening slot was filled by a new show called ''[[The Gascony Show]]'', also hosted by John Slattery.

==Recipient of the 2016 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize==
The Task Force for Global Health received the 2016 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize during a symposium titled "The Future of Humanitarian Action" held at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/task-force-for-global-health-wins-2m-conrad-n-hilton-humanitarian-prize-worlds-largest-humanitarian-award-170335/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Wins $2M Conrad N.

==History==
The organization was co-founded by global health pioneer and former CDC Director, [[William Foege|Dr. William Foege]] and two of his former CDC colleagues, Carol Walters and Bill Watson. It was founded in 1984 as The Task Force for Child Survival.&lt;ref name="Foege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foege |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-partners-in-fighting-disease/2012/11/22/f127b0e2-1f00-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html |title=Global partners in fighting disease |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was initially launched to foster collaboration among leading health and development agencies. Under the leadership of Dr. Foege, The Task Force brought together [[World Bank Group]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[United Nations Development Programme|The United Nations Development Programme]], [[WHO]], and [[UNICEF]], [[WHO]] to raise childhood immunization rates.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/task-force-global-health-receive-2016-2-million-prize-hilton-foundation/ |title=Task Force for Global Health to receive 2016 $2 million prize from Hilton Foundation |website=SaportaReport.com |date=2016-08-09 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, only 20 percent of children worldwide were receiving immunizations and 12,000 children, mostly in the world's poorest countries, were dying every day. By 1990, The Task Force had raised childhood immunization rates to 80 percent globally.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; Since then, The Task Force has used its strength and credibility in collaboration to positively affect a broad range of health issues affecting the world's poor.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; In 2015, The Task Force celebrated 30 years of contributions to global health at an event that included [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadership.saportareport.com/globalhealth/2015/10/15/the-task-force-for-global-health-celebrates-30-years-of-contributions-to-global-health/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Celebrates 30 Years &amp;#124; Global Health |website=Leadership.saportareport.com |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Task Force works with hundreds of partners to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and increase access to medicines and vaccines for [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[influenza]], and [[cholera]]. Beginning with the Mectizan Donation Program,&lt;ref name="Foege"/&gt; The Task Force is credited with working with the pharmaceutical industry to donate billions of dollars annually in essential medicines for the control and elimination of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref name="globalatlanta1"/&gt;

Collaboration, health equity, and social justice are the cornerstones of all Task Force programs.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; The organization is a major partner in the global effort to eliminate three neglected tropical diseases by 2025—blinding [[trachoma]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]—which collectively threaten hundreds of millions of people each year with blindness, disfigurement, and death.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt;

Information and laboratory technologies are vital tools in The Task Force's work to control and eliminate diseases and increase access to quality health care for people in developing countries.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpbnews.org/post/atlanta-considered-how-smartphones-and-science-could-help-eradicate-disease |title=Atlanta Considered: How Smartphones And Science Could Help Eradicate Disease &amp;#124; Georgia Public Broadcasting |website=Gpbnews.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a smartphone-based data collection system, The Task Force maps the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to determine where interventions should be implemented.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"/&gt; It uses portable molecular technology and tablet-based systems to detect and diagnose NTDs within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wabe.org/post/closer-look-mayor-kasim-reed-santa-claus-and-more |title=Closer Look: Mayor Kasim Reed; Santa Claus; And More &amp;#124; WABE 90.1 FM |website=News.wabe.org |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses diverse technologies to help developing countries manage their healthcare workforce in order to meet the health needs of their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2015/03/georgians-nation-stretch-health-resources/ |title=Georgians help a nation stretch its health resources |publisher=Georgia Health News |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, The Task Force's Public Health Informatics Institute was named a partner on a new Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded initiative called the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Program (CHAMPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champshealth.org/|title=CHAMPS|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to understand and ultimately address the causes of death for children under 5 in developing countries.

In 2016, the Task Force helped launch a program called Digital Bridge which is developing an electronic case reporting system to improve information exchange between the public health and healthcare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160827/MAGAZINE/308279979/commentary-stopping-zika-other-emerging-health-threats-requires|title=Commentary: Stopping Zika, other emerging health threats requires stronger surveillance systems|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and future==
In 2016, The Task Force reached an agreement to purchase a DeKalb County government building in downtown Decatur for a larger headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/global-health-organization-plans-expansion-dekalb/IJ3GYxKoKZg75q9EXc9L7I/|title=Task Force for Global Health may buy DeKalb government building|first=Mark|last=Niesse|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has begun examining how it might help address the growing epidemic of [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) in developing countries.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt;

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S. Sunga]] Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1453-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dpage.viewpage%26pageid%3D1638 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619091806/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1638 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[war crime]]s, [[torture]] and [[forced disappearance]]s.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/020/2001/en/|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers|access-date=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light.

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R.

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R.

''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v.

David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The following infractions may be prosecuted:
* Torture
* Terrorism
* Nuclear smuggling
* Naval piracy
* Airplane hijacking

===Germany===
{{Main|Völkerstrafgesetzbuch}}

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilderness''' or '''wildland''' is a [[natural environment]] on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. It may also be defined as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet—those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on  marine wilderness. Recent [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017187 maps of wilderness] suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being [http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30993-9 rapidly degraded by human activity]. Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.010 free from intense human activity]. 

Some governments establish them by law or administrative acts, usually in land tracts that have not been modified by human action in great measure. The main feature of them is that human motorized activity is significantly restricted. These actions seek not only to preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. [[Wilderness areas]] can be found in preserves, conservation preserves, National Forests, National Parks and even in urban areas along rivers, [[gulch]]es or otherwise undeveloped areas. These areas are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], [[biodiversity]], ecological studies, [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt; They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and provide habitat for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

The word ''wilderness'' derives from the notion of "wildness"—in other words, that which is not controlled by humans. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which [[Nature|natural processes]] operate without human interference.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[WILD Foundation]] states that [[wilderness areas]] have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-areas-are-biologically-intact/ Wilderness Areas are Biologically Intact]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-as-a-protected-area-classification/ Wilderness as a Protected Area Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia ([[Strict Nature Reserves]]) and Ib ([[Wilderness Areas]]). Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as [[Wildfire|fire]] suppression and the interruption of [[Bird migration|animal migration]] also affect the interior of wildernesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildland-network.org.uk/wn_what_wildland.htm|title=WHAT IS WILDLAND? - a review|accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in wealthier, industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by [[law]]. Many nations have designated wilderness, including the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]]. Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various [[Parliaments]] and [[Legislatures]] at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that "in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us."&lt;ref&gt;Vance G.

===Ancient times and Middle Ages===
Looked at through the lens of the [[visual arts]], nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] occurred in the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists in the tradition of [[Shan shui]] (lit. ''mountain-water-picture''), learned to depict mountains and rivers "from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature… as if seen through the eyes of a bird." In the 13th century, Shih Erh Chi recommended avoiding painting "scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia-art.net/chinese_tech_brush.html Chinese brush painting] Asia-art.net Retrieved on: 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of [[human history]], the greater part of the Earth's terrain was wilderness, and human attention was concentrated in settled areas. The first known laws to protect parts of nature date back to the Babylonian Empire and Chinese Empire. [[Ashoka]], the Great [[Mauryan]] King, defined the first laws in the world to protect [[flora and fauna]] in [[Edicts of Ashoka]] around 3rd Century B.C. In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] initiated one of the world’s first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to [[Hunting|hunt]] wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Similar measures were introduced in other European countries.

===19th century to present===
The idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the [[Western culture|Western world]] in the 19th century. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth’s]] poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Retrieved: 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century, in Germany, "Scientific Conservation," as it was called, advocated "the efficient utilization of [[natural resources]] through the application of [[science]] and [[technology]]." Concepts of forest management based on the German approach were applied in other parts of the world, but with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref name=Wilderness&gt;Akamani, K. (nd). [http://www.abetterearth.org/article.php/1346.html "The Wilderness Idea: A Critical Review."] A Better Earth.org. Retrieved: 1 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 19th century wilderness became viewed not as a place to fear but a place to enjoy and protect, hence came the [[conservation movement]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Rivers were rafted and mountains were climbed solely for the sake of recreation, not to determine their geographical context.

In 1861, following an intense lobbying by artists (painters), the French Waters and Forests Military Agency set an « artistic reserve » in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.

Global conservation became an issue at the time of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in [[Africa]] in the late 1940s. The British established great [[Nature reserves|wildlife preserves]] there. As before, this interest in conservation had an economic motive: in this case, [[Big-game hunter|big game hunting]]. Nevertheless, this led to growing recognition in the 1950s and the early 1960s of the need to protect large spaces for wildlife conservation worldwide. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF), founded in 1961, grew to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

Early conservationists advocated the creation of a legal mechanism by which boundaries could be set on human activities in order to preserve natural and unique lands for the enjoyment and use of future generations. This profound shift in wilderness thought reached a pinnacle in the US with the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964, which allowed for parts of [[U.S. National Forest]]s to be designated as "wilderness preserves". Similar acts, such as the 1975 [[Eastern Wilderness Act]], followed.

Nevertheless, initiatives for wilderness conservation continue to increase. There are a growing number of projects to [[Tropical rainforest conservation|protect tropical rainforests]] through conservation initiatives. There are also large-scale projects to conserve wilderness regions, such as Canada's [[Boreal Forest Conservation Framework]]. The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada's north.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Boreal Initiative [http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php Boreal Forest Conservation Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208012102/http://www.borealcanada.ca/framework-e.php |date=8 December 2007 }}. www.borealcanada.ca Retrieved on: 1 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[WILD Foundation]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Conservation International]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)]] and many others are active in such conservation efforts.

The 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All [[landscape]]s are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, [[air pollution]] from [[Los Angeles]] and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and [[Sequoia National Park]]. The national park has miles of "wilderness" but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought.

[[File:El Toro Wilderness.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[El Toro Wilderness]] within the [[Caribbean National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]]]]
The creation of [[National Park]]s, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of [[commerce]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[recreation]] combined with increases in [[human population]] have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of "wilderness" were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below).

The first National Park was [[Yellowstone]], which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, E. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/yehtml/yeabout.html Yellowstone, the First National Park] ''Library of Congress,'' Mapping the National Parks. Retrieved on: 2010-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Dedication declared Yellowstone a land "hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magic of Yellowstone|url=http://www.yellowstone-online.com/history/yhfour.html|work=Congressional Acts Pertaining to Yellowstone|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's second national park, the [[Royal National Park]], located just 32&amp;nbsp;km to the south of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], was established in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, ''[http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&amp;ParkKey=N0030&amp;Type=xo "Parks &amp; Reserves: Royal National Park"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820034120/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/parks.nsf/parkContent/N0030?OpenDocument&amp;ParkKey=N0030&amp;Type=Xo |date=20 August 2006 }}''. Accessed 6 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in [[Canada]], which created [[Banff National Park]] in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to "the great wild spaces" of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

By the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the "wilderness" (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's National Parks]] with the building of great hotels such as the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]].

Despite their similar name, national parks in [[England and Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]].

==Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States==
By the later 19th century it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the [[conservation movement]] in the [[United States]], partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as [[John Burroughs]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[John Muir]], and politicians such as [[U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]].
[[File:Cook Lake Bridger Wilderness.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Cook Lake in the Bridger Wilderness, [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]], [[Wyoming]], U.S.]]

The idea of protecting nature for nature's sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like [[Aldo Leopold]], calling for a "land ethic" and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to [[deep ecology]]; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland |publisher=Routledge|date=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different groups had emerged within the US environmental movement by the early 20th century: the conservationists and the preservationists. The initial consensus among conservationists was split into "utilitarian conservationists" later to be referred to as conservationists, and "aesthetic conservationists" or preservationists. The main representative for the former was [[Gifford Pinchot]], first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the ''proper use of nature,'' whereas the preservationists sought the ''protection of nature from use.''&lt;ref name="Wilderness" /&gt; Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether. The management of US public lands during the years 1960s and 70s reflected these dual visions, with conservationists dominating the Forest Service, and preservationists the Park Service&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Raymond A.|title=Introduction to Forest Science|date=1982|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-06438--6|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal Wilderness Designation==

=== International ===
The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and [https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541 Ib (Wilderness areas)]. For the global standard of wilderness (1b) protection, governance and management, read [https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541 Wilderness Protected Areas: Management Guidelines for IUCN Category 1b Protected Areas].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46541|title=Wilderness protected areas {{!}} IUCN Library System|website=portals.iucn.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been recent calls for the [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full World Heritage Convention to better protect wilderness] and to include the word wilderness in their selection criteria for Natural Heritage Sites

Forty-eight countries have wilderness areas established via legislative designation as IUCN protected area management Category 1b sites that do not overlap with any other IUCN designation. They are: Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Finland, French Guyana, Greenland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Northern Mariana Islands, Portugal, Seychelles, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tanzania, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. At publication, there are 2,992 marine and terrestrial wilderness areas registered with the IUCN as solely Category 1b sites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://protectedplanet.net/|title=The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=IUCN and UNEP-WCMC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-two other countries have wilderness areas. These wilderness areas are established via administrative designation or wilderness zones within protected areas. Whereas the above listing contains countries with wilderness exclusively designated as Category 1b sites, some of the below-listed countries contain protected areas with multiple management categories including Category 1b. They are: Argentina, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela, and Zambia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===France===
Since 1861, the French Waters and Forests Military Agency (Administration des Eaux et Forêts) put a strong protection on what was called the « artistic reserve » in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve.

Then in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;1995 &amp; 1998 National Forests Office internal instructions in application of the last paragraph of article L. 212-2 of the French Forest Act&lt;/ref&gt; Integral Biological Reserves (Réserves Biologiques Intégrales, RBI) are dedicated to man free ecosystem evolution, on the contrary of Managed Biological reserves (Réserves Biologiques Dirigées, RBD) where a specific management is applied to conserve vulnerable species or threatened habitats.

Integral Biological Reserves occurs in French State Forests or City Forests and are therefore managed by the [[National Forests Office (France)|National Forests Office]]. In such reserves, all harvests coupe are forbidden excepted exotic species elimination or track safety works to avoid fallen tree risk to visitors (already existing tracks in or on the edge of the reserve).

At the end of 2014,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onf.fr/onf/sommaire/developpement_durable/actions/20080707-150833-949463/@@index.html&lt;/ref&gt; there were 60 Integral Biological Reserves in French State Forests for a total area of 111 082 hectares and 10 in City Forests for a total of 2 835 hectares.

===Greece===
{{Main article|National parks of Greece}}
In Greece there are some parks called "ethniki drimoi" (εθνικοί δρυμοί, national forests) that are under protection of the Greek government. Such parks include: [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassos]] and [[Parnitha]] National Parks.

===Russia===
Due to Russia's size and in comparison non-dense population settlement, as well as of lack of infrastucture and the decades-long iron curtain the country is considered as one of the least explored areas and most natural places in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=August 1881|title=The Unexplored Parts of Europe and Asia|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/024312a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=24|issue=614|pages=312–313|doi=10.1038/024312a0|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.therichest.com/rich-list/12-of-the-least-explored-frontiers-on-earth/|title=12 Of The Least Explored Frontiers On Earth|date=2014-11-11|work=TheRichest|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/the-last-unexplored-places-on-earth/|title=The last unexplored places on Earth|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
There are seven wilderness areas in New Zealand as defined by the [[National Parks Act 1980 (New Zealand)|National Parks Act 1980]] and the [[Conservation Act 1987]] that fall well within the IUCN definition. Wilderness areas cannot have any human intervention and can only have indigenous species re-introduced into the area if it is compatible with conservation management strategies.

In [[New Zealand]] wilderness areas are remote blocks of land that have high natural character. The [[Conservation Act 1987]] prevents any access by vehicles and livestock, the construction of tracks and buildings, and all indigenous natural resources are protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1987/0065/latest/DLM104684.html#DLM104684|title=Conservation Act 1987 Part 4, Section 20|author=New Zealand Government|date=1987|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally over 40,000 ha in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/Conservation/ProtectedAreas/5/en|title=Specially protected areas|last=Malloy|first=Les|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main article|National Wilderness Preservation System}}
[[File:Image-Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge New Jersey03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|'''The Great Swamp''' of New Jersey]], donated for federal protection by concerned residents, was designated as the '''first wilderness refuge in the United States''' - ''winter scene'' photographed in March, 2008]]

In the United States, a Wilderness Area is an area of federal land set aside by an [[United States Congress|act of Congress]]. Human activities in wilderness areas are restricted to scientific study and non-mechanized recreation; horses are permitted but mechanized vehicles and equipment, such as cars and bicycles, are not.

The United States was the first country to officially designate land as "wilderness" through the [[Wilderness Act]] of 1964. The Wilderness Act was—and is still—an important part of wilderness designation because it created the legal definition of wilderness and founded the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as "an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammelled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilderness Act of 1964|url=http://wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=legisact|work=Wilderness.net|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilderness designation helps preserve the natural state of the land and protects flora and fauna by prohibiting development and providing for non-mechanized recreation only.

The first administratively protected wilderness area in the United States was the Gila National Forest. In 1922, [[Aldo Leopold]], then a ranking member of the U.S. Forest Service, proposed a new management strategy for the Gila National Forest. His proposal was adopted in 1924, and 750 thousand acres of the Gila National Forest became the [[Gila Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aldo Leopold|url=http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=feature0105|work=Prominent Figures in Wilderness History|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'[[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge|The Great Swamp in New Jersey]] was the first formally designated wilderness refuge in the United States. It was declared a wildlife refuge on 3 November 1960. In 1966 it was declared a [[National Natural Landmark]] and, in 1968, it was given wilderness status. Properties in the swamp had been acquired by a small group of residents of the area, who donated the assembled properties to the federal government as a park for perpetual protection. Today the refuge amounts to {{convert|7600|acre|km2}} that are within thirty miles of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

While wilderness designations were originally granted by an Act of Congress for Federal land that retained a "primeval character", meaning that it had not suffered from human habitation or development, the [[Eastern Wilderness Act]] of 1975 extended the protection of the NWPS to areas in the eastern States that were not initially considered for inclusion in the Wilderness Act. This act allowed lands that did not meet the constraints of size, roadlessness, or human impact to be designated as wilderness areas under the belief that they could be returned to a "primeval" state through preservation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncmountaintreasures.org/info/wilderness_act.html The Wilderness Act of 1964]".

Approximately {{convert|107,500,000|acre|km2}} are designated as wilderness in the United States. This accounts for 4.82% of the country's total land area; however, 54% of that amount is found in Alaska (recreation and development in Alaskan wilderness is often less restrictive), while only 2.58% of the lower continental United States is designated as wilderness. Following the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009]] there are 756 separate wilderness designations in the United States ranging in size from Florida's Pelican Island at {{convert|5|acre|m2}} to Alaska's Wrangell-Saint Elias at {{convert|9,078,675|acre|km2}}.

===Western Australia===
In Western Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Conservation and Land Management]] Policy Statement No 62, Identification and management of Wilderness and surrounding areas.&lt;/ref&gt; a Wilderness Area is an area that has a wilderness quality rating of 12 or greater and meets a minimum size threshold of 8,000 hectares in temperate areas or 20,000 hectares in arid and tropical areas. A wilderness area is gazetted under section 62(1)(a) of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 by the Minister on any land that is vested in the Conservation Commission of Western Australia.

==International Movement==
[[File:Monument Valley 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Monument Valley]] in [[Utah]], [[United States]].]]

At the forefront of the international wilderness movement has been The [[WILD Foundation]], its founder [[Ian Player]] and its network of sister and partner organizations around the globe. The pioneer [[World Wilderness Congress]] in 1977 introduced the wilderness concept as an issue of international importance, and began the process of defining the term in biological and social contexts. Today, this work is continued by many international groups who still look to the World Wilderness Congress as the international venue for wilderness and to The WILD Foundation network for wilderness tools and action. The [[WILD Foundation]] also publishes the standard references for wilderness professionals and others involved in the issues: ''Wilderness Management: Stewardship and Protection of Resources and Values'', the ''International Journal of Wilderness'', ''A Handbook on International Wilderness Law and Policy'' and ''Protecting Wild Nature on Native Lands'' are the backbone of information and management tools for international wilderness issues.

The [https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/wilderness Wilderness Specialist Group] within the [[World Commission on Protected Areas]] (WTF/WCPA) of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) plays a critical role in defining legal and management guidelines for wilderness at the international level and is also a clearing-house for information on wilderness issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/wilderness|title=Wilderness|date=2016-02-08|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IUCN Protected Areas Classification System defines wilderness as "A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, and/or sea retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition ([[strict nature reserve|Category 1b]])." The [[WILD Foundation]] founded the WTF/WCPA in 2002 and remains co-chair.

The most recent efforts to [https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017187 map wilderness] show that less than one quarter (~23%) of the world's wilderness area now remains, and that there have been [http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30993-9 catastrophic declines in wilderness] extent over the last two decades. Over 3 million square kilometers (10 percent) of wilderness was converted to human land-uses. The Amazon and Congo rain forests suffered the most loss. [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 Human pressure] is starting to extend into almost every corner of the planet. The loss of wilderness could have serious implications for biodiversity conservation.

A previous study, ''Wilderness: Earth's Last Wild Places,'' carried out by [[Conservation International]], 46% of the world's land mass is wilderness. For purposes of this report, "wilderness" was defined as an area that "has 70% or more of its original vegetation intact, covers at least {{convert|10,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} and must have fewer than five people per square kilometer."&lt;ref&gt;Conservation International (2002) [https://www.conservation.org/NewsRoom/pressreleases/Pages/120402-Two-Year-Study-Identifies-Earths-Most-Pristine-Regions.aspx Global Analysis Finds Nearly Half The Earth Is Still Wilderness]. Retrieved on 06 Nov 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[IUCN]]/[[UNEP]] report published in 2003, found that only 10.9% of the world's land mass is currently a Category 1 [[Protected Area]], that is, either a ''[[strict nature reserve]]'' (5.5%) or ''[[protected wilderness]]'' (5.4%).&lt;ref&gt;Chape, S., S.

Of course, there are large tracts of lands in [[National Parks]] and other protected areas that would also qualify as wilderness. However, many protected areas have some degree of human modification or activity, so a definitive estimate of true wilderness is difficult.

The [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] generated a ''human footprint'' using a number of indicators, the absence of which indicate wildness: human population density, human access via roads and rivers, human infrastructure for agriculture and settlements and the presence of industrial power (lights visible from space). The society estimates that 26% of the Earth's land mass falls into the category of "Last of the wild."

It should be noted that the percentage of land area designated "wilderness" does not necessarily reflect a measure of its [[biodiversity]].

==Critique==
[[File:Cedar Mtn Wilderness.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Cedar Mountain Wilderness]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States]].]]

The American concept of wilderness has been criticized by some nature writers. For example, [[William Cronon]] writes that what he calls a wilderness ethic or cult may "teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences", and that "wilderness tends to privilege some parts of nature at the expense of others", using as an example "the mighty canyon more inspiring than the humble marsh."&lt;ref name=Cronon&gt;[http://history.wisc.edu/cronon/Trouble_with_Wilderness_Main.html The Trouble with Wilderness] University of Wisconsin-Madison. Retrieved: 28 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly visible with the fact that nearly all U.S. National Parks preserve spectacular canyons and mountains, and it was not until the 1940s that a swamp became a national park—[[the Everglades]]. In the mid-20th century national parks started to protect [[biodiversity]], not simply attractive scenery.

Cronon also believes the passion to save wilderness "poses a serious threat to responsible [[environmentalism]]" and writes that it allows people to "give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead....to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness".&lt;ref name = "Cronon" /&gt;

[[Michael Pollan]] has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book ''Second Nature'', Pollan writes that "once a landscape is no longer 'virgin' it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable."&lt;ref&gt;Pollan, Michael (2003). ''Second Nature: A Gardener's Education,'' p. 188. Grove Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8021-4011-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another challenge to the conventional notion of wilderness comes from Robert Winkler in his book, ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness''. "On walks in the unpeopled parts of the suburbs," Winkler writes, "I’ve witnessed the same wild creatures, struggles for survival, and natural beauty that we associate with true wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Robert. (2003). ''Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness.'' National Geographic {{ISBN|978-0-7922-6168-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made, as in the [[Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers]] Act, to distinguish "wild" from various levels of human influence: in the Act, "wild rivers" are "not impounded", "usually not accessible except by trail", and their watersheds and shorelines are "essentially primitive".&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 1277, Act No. 283 as amended by Act 110, May 7, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another source of criticism is that the criteria for wilderness designation is vague and open to interpretation. For example, the Wilderness Act states that wilderness must be roadless. The definition given for roadless is "the absences of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Jeffrey O. |title=Struggle over Utah's San Rafael Swell: Wilderness, National Conservation Areas, and National Monuments |date=2007 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=0-8165-2669-9 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been added sub-definitions that have, in essence, made this standard unclear and open to interpretation.

Coming from a different direction, some criticism from the [[Deep Ecology]] movement argues against conflating "wilderness" with "wilderness reservations", viewing the latter term as an oxymoron that, by allowing the law as a human construct to define nature, unavoidably voids the very freedom and independence of human control that defines wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=1-57062-049-0 |pages=345, 339–355 |author=Thomas Birch |authorlink=The Incarceration of Wildness: Wilderness Areas as Prisons|editor=George Sessions}}&lt;/ref&gt; True wilderness requires the ability of life to undergo [[speciation]] with as little interference from humanity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology for the 21st Century |date=1995 |publisher=Shambhala |location=Boston |isbn=1-57062-049-0 |pages=323, 323–330 |author=George Sessions |authorlink=Introduction: Wilderness, the Wild, and Conservation Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]] and scholar on wilderness [[Layla Abdel-Rahim]] argues that it is necessary to understand the principles that govern the economies of mutual aid and diversification in wilderness from a non-anthropocentric perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Children’s Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness |date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-66110-2 |author=[[Layla AbdelRahim]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|thumb|A [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] [[world map]] of shorelines and national borders under the [[Robinson projection]]]]

The '''world''' is the planet [[Earth]] and all [[life]] upon it, including [[human civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-webster.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[history of the world]] is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilizations]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html ''American Heritage Dictionary'' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2003). ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. pg. 462. {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement." While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R|last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earth was often described as "the center of the world".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archivedate=2013-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[academia|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[fashion industry]].
* historically, the ''[[New World]]'' vs. the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonized in the wake of the [[age of discovery]]. Now mostly used in zoology and botany, as in [[New World monkey]].

==Philosophy==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]]. 

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[flat earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heidegger |first=Martin |title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology |location=Bloomington |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1982 |page=165 |isbn=0-253-17686-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

===Parmenides===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion (doxa)|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

===Plato===
In his [[Allegory of the Cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

===Hegel===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

===Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].
Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

===Wittgenstein===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

===Heidegger===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1982), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

===Freud===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

===Other===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

==Religion and mythology==

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]
[[Mythological cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality{{citation needed|date=October 2018}})&lt;ref&gt;Hemer, C. J. “Worldly.” Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988.&lt;/ref&gt; is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

===Buddhism===

In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

===Christianity===

In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world"—as [[Jesus]] said—and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "monkhood", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices."}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in Scripture with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. For contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the recognition that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm Contemptus mundi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been criticized as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm Parish Missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

====Eastern Christianity====

In Eastern Christian monasticism or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the [[Philokalia]] and the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[theoria|Vision of God]].

====Orbis Catholicus====

''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

===Islam===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".&lt;ref&gt;Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hinduism===
'''Hinduism''' is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life,{{refn|group=note|name="definition"}} widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from Jainism and Buddhism, and (since medieaval and modern times) Islam and Christianity. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,{{refn|group=note|See:

[[File:Net Population Growth in 2016.svg|thumb|400px|Distribution of global population increase in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/|title=Population by Country|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''World Population day''' is an annual event, observed on July 11 every year, which seeks to raise awareness of [[world population|global population]] issues. The event was established by the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in 1989. It was inspired by the public interest in Five Billion Day on July 11, 1987, the approximate date on which the world's population reached five billion people. World Population Day aims to increase people's awareness on various population issues such as the importance of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights.

The day was suggested by Dr KC Zachariah in which population reaches Five Billion when he worked as Sr Demographer at World Bank.

While press interest and general awareness in the global population surges only at the increments of whole billions of people, the world population increases annually by 100 million approximately every 14 months. The world population reached 7,400,000,000 on February 6, 2016; the world population had reached 7,500,000,000 at around 16:21 on April 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info|title=Worldometers real time world statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9168">{{World Rugby Rankings}}
The '''World Rugby Rankings''' (formerly the '''IRB Rankings''') is a [[ranking]] system for  men's national teams in [[rugby union]], managed by [[World Rugby]], the sport's governing body. The teams of World Rugby's member nations are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded on the basis of the results of World Rugby-recognized international matches. Rankings are based on a team's performance, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. The ranking system was introduced the month before the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], with the first new rankings issued on 8 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2003/0910/breaking64.html |title=England top IRB rankings, Ireland third |publisher=[[The Irish Times| Times]]|date=2003-09-09 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rank leaders==
&lt;div style=text-align:center;float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em&gt; '''World Rugby Ranking Leaders'''&lt;br&gt;{{IRB World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;

When the system was introduced [[England national rugby union team|England]] were the top team and maintained that position following victory in the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. [[All Blacks|New Zealand]] took the lead from 7 June 2004. After winning the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] final, South Africa became the third team to achieve first place. The first two fixtures of the [[2008 Tri Nations Series|2008 Tri Nations]] resulted in the top two teams switching places: the All Blacks regained the top spot after defeating South Africa in the Tri-Nations opener on 5 July 2008 [[Westpac Stadium|in Wellington]]; a week later the Springboks returned the favour [[Carisbrook|in Dunedin]], scoring their first win over the All Blacks in New Zealand since 1998, reclaiming the top spot, only for the All Blacks to defeat both Australia and South Africa in August 2008 to regain the top spot by a considerable margin. South Africa regained the lead in July 2009 after beating New Zealand in Bloemfontein and kept the lead until losing to France in November of that year, allowing the All Blacks to regain the top spot.

New Zealand have been the most consistently ranked #1 team since the introduction of IRB World Rankings, having held the #1 ranking for more than 85 percent of the time during this period. South Africa and England make up the remainder.

== Current calculation method==
All World Rugby member countries have been given a rating that is in the range of 0 to 100 with the top side achieving a rating of about 90 points. The point system is calculated using a 'Points Exchange' system, in which sides receive points from each other on the basis of the match result – whatever one side gains, the other loses. The exchanges are based on the match result, the ranking of each team, and the margin of victory, with an allowance for home advantage. As the system aims to depict current team strengths, past successes or losses will fade and be superseded by more recent results. Thus, it is thought that it will produce an accurate picture depicting the actual current strength and thus rank of the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/explain/index.html |title=Rankings Explanation |accessdate=2007-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005062318/http://www.irb.com/rankings/explain/index.html |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings are responsive to results and it is possible to climb to the top from the bottom (and vice versa) in fewer than 20 matches. As all matches are worth a net of 0 points for the two teams combined, there is no particular advantage to playing more matches. A rating stays the same until the team plays again. Although matches often result in points exchanges, 'predictable' results lead to very minor changes, and may result in no change to either side's rating.

===Rules===
The system ensures that it is representative of the teams' performance despite playing differing numbers of matches per annum, and the differing strength of opposition that teams have to face. The factors taken into account are as follows:
*Match result
*Match status
*Opposition strength
*Home advantage

====Match result====
For each match played points exchanges are awarded for the following five outcomes and was developed using results of international matches from 1871 to the present day: 
* a win or loss by more than 15 points
* a win or loss by up to 15 points
* a draw

====Match status====
Different matches have different importance to teams, and World Rugby has tried to respect this by using a weighting system, where the most significant matches are in the World Cup Finals. Points exchanges are doubled during the [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] Finals to recognise the unique importance of this event. All other full international matches are treated the same, to be as fair as possible to countries playing a different mix of friendly and competitive matches. Matches that do not have full international status do not count.

====Opposition strength====
A win against a very highly ranked opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, so the strength of the opposing team is a factor. Thus match results are more important than margins of victory in producing accurate rankings. This is because when a highly ranked team plays a lowly ranked team and manages to beat them by over 50 points, it does not necessarily indicate how either team will perform in the future.

==== Home advantage ====
When calculating points exchanges, the home side is handicapped by treating them as though they are three rating points better than their current rating. This results in the home side gaining fewer points for winning and losing more points for losing. Because of this, ideally, any advantage that a side may have by playing in front of their home crowd is cancelled out.

==== New and dormant nations====
All new member nations start with 30.00 points, which is provisional until they have completed ten [[Rugby union#Major international competitions|test matches]]. When countries merge, the new country inherits the higher rating of the two countries but when they split e.g., the 2010 breakup of the [[Arabian Gulf rugby union team]] into separate teams representing its current member countries, the new countries will inherit a rating at a fixed level below the rating of the original country.

Before 1 December 2012 new member nations were given 40.00 points.

Countries that have not played a [[Rugby union#Major international competitions|test]] for two years are removed from the ranking system and the list. If they become active again, they resume their previous rating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">The '''world to come''', '''age to come''', and '''heaven on Earth''' are [[eschatological]] phrases reflecting the belief that the [[World (theology)|current world]] or [[Dispensation (period)|current age]] is flawed or [[curse]]d{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or [[paradise]]. The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of [[heaven]], the [[afterlife]], and the [[Kingdom of God]] in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the [[Kingdom of God]] could be in the present (such as [[Realized eschatology]]) or the future.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Hindu eschatology==
[[Image:Kalki.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalki]] with his  white horse]]
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
In Hindu eschatology the current age is the [[Kali Yuga]], a period of decline. [[Kalki]] ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a [[golden age]] of [[Satya Yuga]].

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.&lt;ref name="Chandra"/&gt;

==Jewish eschatology==
[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|thumb|[[Resurrection of the dead]], fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue]]
[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|''HaOlam HaBa'']], or "the world to come", is an important part of [[Jewish eschatology]], although [[Judaism]] concentrates on the importance of ''HaOlam HaZeh'' ("this world").  The [[afterlife]] is known as ''Olam haBa'', ''[[Gan Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Gan Eden]]'' (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jews are told to live their lives on earth to the full, as their bodies will stay there but their souls live on. [http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a ''[[Ger toshav]]'' (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian eschatology==
[[Image:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', an 1887 painting by [[Victor Vasnetsov]]. The [[Lamb of God]] is visible at the top.]]
{{main|Christian eschatology}}
Under [[Christian]] [[eschatology]], the phrase is found in the [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use#1988 ecumenical version .28ELLC.29|Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version)]]: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-bible.com/Exegesis/creeds.htm |title=The Nicene Creed |publisher=Christian-bible.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|18:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:5|KJV}}. Other related expressions are "age to come" which is typically found in more recent translations, [[Kingdom of God]], [[Messianic Age]], [[Millennial Age]], [[The New Earth]] and [[New Jerusalem]], and [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] and possibly also [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].

==Zoroastrian eschatology==
In [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.

[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia]]
[[File:Ball's Pyramid2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.78|Most of Zealandia is underwater. [[Ball's Pyramid]], near [[Lord Howe Island]], is one place where it rises above sea level]]

Zealandia is largely made up of two nearly parallel ridges, separated by a [[Aulacogen|failed]] [[rift]], where the rift breakup of the continent stops and becomes a filled [[graben]]. The ridges rise above the [[seabed|sea floor]] to heights of {{convert|1000|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with few rocky [[island]]s rising above [[sea level]]. The ridges are continental rock, but are lower in elevation than normal continents because their crust is thinner than usual, approximately {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} thick, and consequently they do not float as high above the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].

About 25 million years ago, the southern part of Zealandia (on the [[Pacific Plate]]) began to shift relative to the northern part (on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]]). The resulting displacement by approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the [[Alpine Fault]] is evident in geological maps.&lt;ref name="UNCLOS map"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unclosnz.org.nz/acretion_map.html |title=Figure 4.

Compression across the boundary has uplifted the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], although due to rapid erosion their height reflects only a small fraction of the uplift. Farther north, subduction of the Pacific Plate has led to extensive volcanism, including the [[Coromandel Peninsula|Coromandel]] and [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]]s. Associated rifting and subsidence has produced the Hauraki Graben and more recently the Whakatane Graben and Wanganui Basin.

Volcanism on Zealandia has also taken place repeatedly in various parts of the continental fragment before, during and after it [[rift]]ed away from the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Although Zealandia has shifted approximately {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest with respect to the underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] from the time when it rifted from Antarctica, recurring intracontinental volcanism exhibits magma composition similar to that of volcanoes in previously adjacent parts of Antarctica and Australia.

This volcanism is widespread across Zealandia but generally of low volume apart from the huge mid to late [[Miocene]] [[shield volcano]]es that developed the [[Banks Peninsula|Banks]] and [[Otago Peninsula]]s. In addition, it took place continually in numerous limited regions all through the [[Late Cretaceous]] and the [[Cenozoic]]. However, its causes are still in dispute. During the [[Miocene]], the northern section of Zealandia ([[Lord Howe Rise]]) might have slid over a stationary [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], forming the [[Lord Howe Seamount Chain]].

Zealandia is occasionally divided by scientists into two regions, North Zealandia (or Western Province) and South Zealandia (or Eastern Province), the latter of which contains most of the Median [[Batholith]] crust. These two features are separated by the [[Alpine Fault]] and [[Kermadec Trench]] and by the wedge-shaped [[Hikurangi Plateau]], and are moving separately to each other.&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt;

=== Classification as a continent ===
The case for Zealandia being a continent in its own right was argued by Nick Mortimer and Hamish Campbell in their book ''Zealandia: Our continent revealed'' in 2014,&lt;ref name=MortimerCampbell2014 /&gt; citing geological and ecological evidence to support the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Yarwood, V. |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |series=Book Review |title=Zealandia: Our continent revealed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729235207/https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-our-continent-revealed/ |archive-date=29 July 2017 |magazine=New Zealand Geographic |date=November–December 2014 |access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a team of eleven geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a drowned continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment.&lt;ref name=mortimer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortimer |first1=Nick |last2=Campbell |first2=Hamish J. |title=Zealandia: Earth’s Hidden Continent |journal=GSA Today |volume=27 |year=2017 |url=https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |doi=10.1130/GSATG321A.1 |dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217064642/https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/3/article/GSATG321A.1.htm |archive-date=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely covered by news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Randall |title=Meet Zealandia: Earth's latest continent |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |agency=CNN |date=16 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217050332/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/travel/zealandia-new-continent-discovered/ |archivedate=17 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Elle |title=Zealandia – pieces finally falling together for continent we didn't know we had |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |agency=The Guardian |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226124213/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/zealandia-pieces-finally-falling-together-for-long-overlooked-continent |archive-date=26 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=East |first1=Michael |title=Scientists discover 'Zealandia' – a hidden continent off the coast of Australia |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |publisher=The Telegraph |date=16 February 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218202907/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/16/scientists-discover-eighth-continent-zealandia/ |archive-date=18 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeography ==
New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent, while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the [[Antarctic Flora]], including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], logs of a [[fossil]]ized [[forest]] closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] can be seen that grew on Zealandia about 180 million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |title=Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |archive-date=17 October 2008 |access-date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were buried by volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by [[silica]] to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea.

During glacial periods, more of Zealandia becomes a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]] fauna, but [[Saint Bathans mammal|the discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw]] from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last1=Campbell |first1=Hamish |author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=North Shore, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-14-302088-2 |pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political divisions ==
[[File:Zealandia EEZs.tif|thumb|right|[[Exclusive economic zone]] of New Zealand and continental shelf boundaries for much of Zealandia]]

The total land area (including [[internal waters|inland water bodies]]) of Zealandia is {{convert|286655|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Of this, [[New Zealand]] comprises the majority, at {{convert|267988|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, or 93%) which includes the mainland, nearby islands, and most outlying islands including the [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], [[Campbell Islands]], and [[Chatham Islands]] (but not the [[Kermadec Islands]] or [[Macquarie Island]] ([[Australia]]), which are part of the rift).

[[New Caledonia]] and the islands surrounding it comprise some {{convert|18576|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 7%) and the remainder is made up of various [[States and territories of Australia|territories]] of [[Australia]] including [[Lord Howe Island]] Group ([[New South Wales]])  at {{convert|56|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.02%), [[Norfolk Island]] at {{convert|35|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=x| (}} or 0.01%), as well as [[Elizabeth Reef|Elizabeth]] and [[Middleton Reef]]s ([[Coral Sea Islands]] Territory) with {{convert|0.25|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

== Population ==
The total human population of Zealandia today is about 5&amp;nbsp;million people.
