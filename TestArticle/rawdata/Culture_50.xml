{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}} 
The '''black and red ware culture''' (BRW) is a late [[Bronze Age India]]n and early [[Iron Age India]]n [[archaeological culture]] of the northern and central [[Indian subcontinent]], associated with the [[Vedic civilization]].

In the Western [[Ganges]] plain (western [[Uttar Pradesh]]) it is dated to c. 1450-1200 BCE, and is succeeded by the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]]; whereas in the Central and Eastern Ganges plain (eastern Uttar Pradesh, [[Bihar]], and [[Bengal]]) and Central India ([[Madhya Pradesh]]) the BRW appears during the same period but continues for longer, until c. 700-500 BCE, when it is succeeded by the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hTwuFUW5aEgC ''Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia''] (Routledge, 2005), p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western Ganges plain, the BRW was preceded by the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]]. The BRW sites were characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]] (cultivation of rice, barley, and legumes), and yielded some ornaments made of shell, copper, [[carnelian]], and [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA220 ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sites, particularly in [[Punjab, India|eastern Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]], BRW pottery is associated with Late [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] pottery, and according to some scholars like Tribhuan N. Roy, the BRW may have directly influenced the [[Painted Grey Ware]] and [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. 1993, Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond. In Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times, ed. [[Howard Spodek|H. Spodek]] and D.M. Srinivasan. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; BRW pottery is unknown west of the Indus Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. Mathura: A protohistoric Perspective in D.M. Srinivasan (ed.), Mathura, the Cultural Heritage, 1989, pp. 171-180. Delhi. cited in Chakrabarti 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  

Use of iron, although sparse at first, is relatively early, postdating the beginning of the Iron Age in [[Anatolia]] ([[Hittites]]) by only two or three centuries, and predating the [[Europe]]an ([[Celt]]s) Iron Age by another two to three hundred years. Recent findings in Northern India show Iron working in the 1800-1000 BCE period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewari |first1=Rakesh |title=The origins of iron working in India: new evidence from the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas |journal=Antiquity |date=2003 |volume=77 |issue=297 |pages=536–544 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00092590}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shaffer, the "nature and context of the iron objects involved [of the BRW culture] are very different from early iron objects found in Southwest Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer 1989, cited in Chakrabarti 1992:171&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''Bouffée déliriante''' is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] in [[West Africa]] and [[Haiti]] of a sudden outburst of [[aggression]], confusion and psychomotor excitement, possibly including visual or auditory [[hallucination]]s and [[paranoia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chabrol H | year = 2003 | title = Chronic hallucinatory psychosis, bouffée déliriante, and the classification of psychosis in French psychiatry | url = | journal = Curr Psychiatry Rep| volume =  5| issue = | pages =  187–91| pmid = 12773270 | doi=10.1007/s11920-003-0040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bouffée déliriante is a French term that was introduced in 1886 by [[Valentin Magnan]] meaning short-lived [[psychosis]]. He used it to describe transient psychotic or psychosis reactions. Bouffée déliriante reactions are sudden attacks of brief duration with paranoid delusions and often concomitant hallucinations, typically precipitated by an intense fear of magical persecution through sorcery or witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang, G. (2001, July) Cultural Factors in Psychiatric Disorders. Retrieved June 19, 2013 from {{cite web |url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/wolfgang.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208104913/http://www.mentalhealth.com/mag1/wolfgang.html |archivedate=2015-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[ICD-10]], Bouffée déliriante is classified as a subtype of either Acute polymorphic [[psychotic disorder]] without symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] (F23.0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD10 Version:2015|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F23.0|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD10 Version:2015|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F23.1|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Bouffée délirante" literally means a "delirious flash".

The '''Burung Petala Processions''' (literary "Celestial Bird Processions") ({{lang-ms|Perarakan Burung Petala}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]:ڤراراكن بوروڠ ڤتالا) referred to a series of imperial parade to commemorate the circumcision ceremony of the [[Kelantan]]ese nobility. During the grand cavalcade, the prince and his royal entourage were celebrated around [[Kota Bharu]] via a large bird-like processional cart, notably the [[Float (parade)|grand chariot]] of 1933 known as '''Burung Petala Indra''' and ''[[Litter (vehicle)|tandu]]'' '''Burung Petalawati''' of 1923. The processions were held three times between 1919 and 1933.

==Origin==
[[File:Burung Gagak Sura.jpg|thumb|Burung Gagak Sura from the neighbouring [[Pattani Kingdom]] in the 19th century, predecessor of the Petala Birds.]]

===Pre-Islamic era===
The celebrations rooted from the historical grand parades observed during the pre-Islamic era of the northern coast of [[Malay Peninsula]]. As noted from the old records from [[Chi Tu]], the Chinese ambassador of the kingdom would be paraded under a similar fashion upon their arrival to the city state.  This largely originated from the custom that holds every state delegations should be celebrated akin as the return of the gods from the heavenly abode. The kingdom managed to obtained strong diplomatic relationship with ancient China derived from the epic celebrations for its delegations.&lt;ref name="PPSK 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|PPSK|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gagak Sura===
As the coming of [[Islam]] transformed the [[Kra Isthmus|isthmian Malay]] society, so did the function and philosophy of the procession which is then inherited to commemorate Islamic elements and [[Five Pillars of Islam|belief system]]. The birds were mobilised for official use, including during the enthronement of the prince, arrival of state delegations and during royal circumcision celebrations. While not in use, the bird would be nestled in a special chamber, with a courtier delegated with a task of conducting rituals to guard her "spirit".&lt;ref name="Persatuan Pencinta Sejarah Kelantan 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Persatuan Pencinta Sejarah Kelantan|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procession was later recorded in great detail upon the arrival of the British colonial administrator in Kelantan from 1909.

There are several variants of the bird in [[Pattani]] and Kelantan, including ''Burung Gagak Suro'' (Raven), ''Karawek'' (Birds of Paradise), ''Merak Mas'' (Peacock), [[Garuda]] and ''Burung Singa'' (Lion Bird).&lt;ref name="Pattani 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Pattani|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janine Yasovant 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Janine Yasovant|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay customary practise===
In the traditional Malay custom, a child would usually be carried on the shoulder of his dad from his abode to the place where his circumcision will be held. But for the more affluent Malay families, the ceremony would be more lavish, the child would be transported on a processional carrier, in a form of boat or a small mosque-like structure by a group of men, a philosophical correspondence of a [[rite of passage]] from boys to men. More elaborate practise of the celebration would include a march of men with weapons, musical performance and even ceremonial foods being included in the parade.&lt;ref name="Izmer Ahmad 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Izmer Ahmad|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century Kelantan===
Based on the record by Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof, it was narrated that the sultan had a dream about the Burung Petala Wati, the traditional guardian of Kelantan. Following the account, he ordered the construction of the mystical [[Thunderbird (cryptozoology)|Thunderbird]] for his prince.&lt;ref name="Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof  2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Ghulam-Sarwar Yousof|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the origin of Petala Wati denotes a far more secular account, as it was believed that the construction of the ark was mainly to illustrate the grandeur of the Kelantanese monarch and to please the [[Resident (title)|British colonial resident]] at that time, who were intrigued by the local Malay culture, heritage and [[Malay folklore|folklore]].&lt;ref name="Persatuan Pencinta Sejarah Kelantan 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Persatuan Pencinta Sejarah Kelantan|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the chariot emulated many ornamental figures derived from ancient [[Malay mythology]], kingship and the tales from Malay [[hikayat]]s. Based on the narration by Paul J. Coatalen in his interview with a local Malay Bomoh ([[shaman]]) about a parallel Kelantanese imperial vessel, he asserts that the ceremonial vehicle is a symbol of Malay mysticism adopted based upon the legendary promise made between the ancestors of the Kelantan king with a loyal warrior known as Isma Dewa Pekerma Raja.&lt;ref name="PPSK 2017" /&gt;

While based on the record between Coatalen and Haji Mubin Sheppard in “Processional Birds Of Kelantan” and “The Giant bird”, he asserted that there was a strong correlation between the [[Royal barge]] of Pertala Sri Kelantan with the [[Hindu]] epics, deriving [[eagle|Helang]], [[Gull|Burung Camar Laut]], [[Garuda]] and [[Phoenix (mythology)|Jentayu]] as a source of identity and inspiration. This was heavily owed from the fact that the [[Malayisation|Malayalised]] Hindu literature was highly celebrated during the period and the tales of Hikayat Maharaja Wana, Ramayana, Isma Dewa Perkerma Raja were often transmitted into the form of [[Bangsawan|Malay theater]] and [[Wayang kulit]], thus become a norm by the Kelantanese Malay society. Based on Coatalen, despite the design and the name of Hindu mythologies were adopted in the bird art, it doesn't necessary bear any Hindu religious [[syncretism]], instead the adoption was solely for cosmetic factors, he added.&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965"&gt;{{harvnb|Sheppard|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1972"&gt;{{harvnb|Sheppard|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would take 3 months to built each of the Petala Birds. The last of the birds was built long after the end of the [[World War II]], solely constructed as a display upon the request of the [[Muzium Negara|National Museum of Malaysia]]. The [[Litter (vehicle)|tandu]] was named Pertala Indra Maha Sakti and completed in 1963, constructed by the son of one of the assistant craftsman that built the earlier royal birds, Mohamed Noor bin Daud (Weh Burong); he was assisted by Awang bin Sulong and under the supervision Ismail Bakti.&lt;ref name="Pyqa Nor 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Pyqa Nor|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resurrected bird was by far dwarfed in comparison of all her predecessors, nonetheless fine details in the woodcraft remains.&lt;ref name="PPSK 2017" /&gt; Being the sole surviving Kelantanese artist with such expertise, it was largely emulated based on the artisan's childhood memory of helping his father constructing the bird. As of 2017, the sculpture is stored in the Kelantan Heritage Trust in [[Kota Bharu]].

===Design===
[[File:Burung-burung petala.jpg|thumb|A comparison between structures, size and figures of 1933 Burung Petala Indra (left), Burung Petala Wati in 1922 (middle) and Pertala Indra Maha Sakti of 1963 (right). In contrast to the earlier birds for ceremonial purposes, Pertala Indra Maha Sakti was solely constructed for the display upon the request of the [[National Museum (Malaysia)|National Museum of Malaysia]].]]

====Petala Indra====
The Burung Petala Indra of 1933 stands 20 feet tall. It was constructed for Tengku Yunus, a 12-year-old, the third son of the crown prince, Raja Zainal Abidin. Reid, a photographer for The Straits Times Annual in Kelantan noted that several large trees in Kota Bharu have to be removed earlier, in order to maneuver the colossal monument during the celebration. A painted 10 foot square wooded pavilion was erected above colossal bird replica, holding with its [[Singgora]]-styled roof. A pair of ornamental [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] carved with naga motives are attached onto each [[bargeboard]] and the roof tiers. The pavilion can carry up to 6 passengers inside.&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965" /&gt; There were many prominent woodcarver involved in the project, including Encik Ismail, the head artisan for Petala Indra and Encik Long, a royal sculptor from the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Besut]].&lt;ref name="Pyqa Nor 2017" /&gt;

====Petalawati====
While the smaller pair of 1923 [[Litter (vehicle)|tandu]] Petala having a similar pavilion-styled platform with 3 tier [[hipped roof]] with a crest. The beak of the replica was painted in gold and her fangs were made from elephant tusk. The bird was seen biting a venomous snake known as Ular Naga Bora that coiled around the bird's neck while her eyes were made from precious stones.

The bird's main body was decorated by golden [[Tinsel]] wraps. The fur on her head and neck were tailored from various [[velvet]] and [[silk]]s, while the feathers on her wings and tail were casted from various glossy papers based on the hue of the rainbows. The bird shiny stood underneath the ray of sun.

===Inspiration===
There are two conflicting accounts for the identity of the bird, based on the characters in the assemble.

====Hikayat Isma Dewa====
Many believed that the processional cart was a personification of Sarung Dewa Purba Raksasa, a gigantic bird from the epic Raja Isma Dewa, a local [[Malay literature|Kelantanese Malay lore]]. This is supported by the incorporation of a [[Crown (headgear)|crowned]] white [[monkey]] that stood beneath the Burung Petala Wati of 1923, the white monkey itself was a character from Hikayat Isma Dewa, a companion of the heroic character. The function of the monkey was to persuade the young prince to be as brave as his favourite hero in the saga.&lt;ref name="PPSK 2017" /&gt;

====Hikayat Mahabratta====
Another alternative view stated that the birds were derived from [[Mahabharata]], with the identity and design of the gigantic bird was based on the [[Malayisation|Malayalised]] version of the sacred [[Garuda]]. The act of the bird eating the serpent is a philosophical symbolism of destroying the evil. Based on this understanding, instead of Isma Dewa, the main idol in this version was [[Vishnu]]. This notion was largely observed by Haji Mubin Sheppard.&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Izmer Ahmad 2008" /&gt;

==Prosession==
===The Grand Parade===
[[File:Burung Petala Indera III.jpg|thumb|Thousands of people were gathered to witnessed the procession.]]
They day of the [[parade]] was the highlight of the [[month]] long festival. The carnival lavishly commenced from the [[Palace|palatial gate]] of Kelantan and continued throughout the main avenues of [[Kota Bharu]] to an area known as Batu Peringatan in Padang Bank, passing through various government complex and the residence of other prominent members from the Kelantanese nobility. The grand parade was divided into 38 parts, with some of the performances were held on a moving stage.&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PPSK 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa bin Ibrahim 1989"&gt;{{harvnb|Mustafa bin Ibrahim|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bougas 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Bougas|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 300 members of the Malay regiment accompanying the chariot, it begins with a unit of speared men from the imperial court who wore black, followed by candlestick bearers wearing a red uniform and a unit of rifflemen that would fire [[celebratory gunfire|celebratory gunshots]] during the procession.

Behind the military contingent was a group of female palatial maids wearing a yellow [[sash|shoulder cloth]], holding a pedestrial tray with ritualistic yellow [[glutinous rice]] known as ''nasi semangat'' to strengthen the prince's spirit before the [[circumcision]]. The maidens were followed by a royal guards armed with weaponry of [[Keris]] and [[sword]]s, while at their back was a group of maiden carrying a ceremonial box, handheld fan, silver container, Royal betel box, [[Censer|incense burner]], silver water container and a plethora of other items from the imperial regalia.

[[File:Burung Petala Indera I.png|thumb|left|The revered bird, with the British officer can be seen sitting in the pavilion in his western attire.]]
Following the royal entourage was an open platform of 5 Malay orchestras, staged by a [[Menora (dance)|Menora]] and [[Mak Yong]] performance. While the closed platform behind was occupied by the court dancers, elegantly posed in their classical [[Asyik]] and [[Joget]] costumes. However, in contrast to the preceding Menora and Makyong performers, they do not openly dance during the gala. Behind the court dancers was a [[Wayang Kulit]] performance and a [[Silat]] troop.

The towering bird came after the performance. The climax of the imperial cavalcade, it ferried the prince together his two younger brothers with a senior religious clerics and the British resident at that time. The princes were seen to be donned under a richly woven ceremonial attire made from silk, they wore fine gold and jewelry with a keris nicely tucked around their waist. The chariot was mobilised by hundreds of men, all reciting the Islamic prayers and [[salawat|selawat]]. The men were all individually selected by their village headman from their respected [[kampung]] throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Sheppard 1965" /&gt;

The entourage ends with a platform for the [[percussion]] and the Great Kelantan drum, Known as "Rebana Besar".

Trailing behind the men was dozens of sons from the noble families of Kelantan and the older relatives of the prince, all were attending to usher the circumcision carnival.

===Developments after 1933===
The Burung Petala Indra of 1933 was the last of its kind staged in Kelantan. Following the consultation from the local Kelantanese [[ulema]], it was firmly advised that the element of [[Shirk (Islam)|deviation]] from the Islamic teaching was present in the parade.&lt;ref name="Persatuan Pencinta Sejarah Kelantan 2015" /&gt; Hence, following the verdict, all of the birds were destroyed by the authorities.

The tradition however, is still survived although is under the verge of extinction across the border in [[Pattani]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Janine Yasovant 2016" /&gt; It is celebrated by the [[Thai Malay]] community in the form of Burong Gagak Suro ({{Lang-th|บุหรงฆาเฆาะซูรอ}}; {{RTGS|''Buhrng ḳhaḳheaa su rx''}}),&lt;ref name="Pattani 2017" /&gt; albeit it is usually celebrated in a smaller scale compared to its historical predecessors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13854">The '''California Resale Royalty Act''' ([http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html Civil  Code section 986]) entitles [[artist]]s to a [[royalty payment]] upon the [[resale]] of their works of art under certain circumstances.

== Conditions for resale royalty payments ==
* The artist at the time of the sale is a United States citizen or has been a California resident for at least two years.
* The seller resides in California or the sale takes place in California.
* The work is an original painting, drawing, sculpture or original work of art in glass.
* The work is sold by the seller for more money than she or he paid.
* The work is sold for a gross price of more than $1,000 or is exchanged for one or more works of art or for a combination of cash, other   property, and one or more works of fine art with a fair market value of more than $1,000.
* The work is sold during the artist's lifetime or within 20 years of the artist's death.&lt;ref name="CAC"&gt;[http://www.cac.ca.gov/artsinfo/resaleroyalty.php California Arts Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Act does not apply if:
* The sale is the initial sale of the work and the legal title of the work at the time of such initial sale is vested in the artist.
* The resale of fine art is by an art dealer to a purchaser within 10 years after the initial sale by the artist to an art dealer, provided that all intervening sales are between art dealers.
* The sale consists of a work of stained glass artistry permanently attached to real property and it was sold as part of the sale of the real property to which it was attached.&lt;ref name="CAC"/&gt;

== Requirements under the Act for Qualifying Works ==
When the sale of a work meets the conditions outlined above, a seller must pay the artist 5% of the resale price. If the artist is deceased, the payment goes to the artist's estate or heirs. It is the seller's obligation to locate the artist within 90 days of the sale. If the artist or heirs cannot be located, the seller is to make payment to the [[California Arts Council]], who will hold the collected payments for up to 7 years for the artist. In the event that the Council is unable to locate a particular artist or the artist fails to claim the collected royalties in that time period, the funds collected are distributed to the city of Sacramento's Art in Public Places&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacmetroarts.org/art-in-public-places.html&lt;/ref&gt; program.&lt;ref name="code"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/986.html|title=California Civil Code  Section 986 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's right to receive the royalty cannot be waived in full; it can only be modified by written contract providing for a royalty payment in excess of the 5% of resale value that is required by the Act.&lt;ref name="code"/&gt;

== History of the Resale Right ==
California's Resale Royalty Act was signed into law in 1976. The resale right has its origins in the French law [[droit de suite]], first enacted in 1920, which provided French artists the right to receive a royalty from resales of their work.&lt;ref name="lmu.edu"&gt;"The Droite de Suite: Why American Fine Artists Should Have a Right to a Resale Royalty." Loyola of Los Angeles Entertainment Law Review. March 1, 1995. Vol. 15, Page 10.http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&amp;context=elr&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''droite de suite'' reflects both the idea that artists have certain moral rights in their works (such as the inalienable right to be associated with their works) and the economic concern that artists often are unable to benefit from the full value of their works, where they have low bargaining power in initial sales or where their works appreciate significantly in value after the first sale.&lt;ref name="NYSBA"&gt;"A Right Deferred:Resale Royalties for Visual Artists." Law Student Connection, February 17, 2012.http://nysbar.com/blogs/lawstudentconnection/2012/02/a_right_deferred_resale_royalt.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, over 60 countries across the world recognize some version of the resale right.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"&gt;"Resale Royalty Right." Copyright Office, Notice of Inquiry.Federal Register Vol. 77 No. 182, page 58177.[http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berne Convention ===
The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] of 1886 included a ''droite de suite'' provision in Article 14''ter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its 1948 revision. This article provided for a general recognition of a resale right among signatory countries, but included the stipulation that protection provided by such recognition “may be claimed in a country of the Union only if legislation in the country to which the author belongs so permits, and to the extent permitted by the country where this protection is claimed.”&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P188_36636|title=WIPO-Administered Treaties: Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Currently, California is the only state that recognizes the resale right. The Copyright Office conducted a study,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992, evaluating the nature of the resale right and the possibility of adopting a federal ''droite de suite''. The Copyright Office concluded in the report that there were not adequate economic or copyright policy justifications to warrant adopting ''droite de suite'' at the federal level. The report did indicate that should the EU harmonize its ''droit de suite'' laws and extend the resale right to all member states, Congress may at that point revisit the resale right issue.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/droit_de_suite.pdf|title=Study, page 149.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, legislation was proposed in both the Senate (S.2000)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the House (H.R.3688)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3688&lt;/ref&gt;  in December 2011 that would provide for a national resale royalty right. The Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011 (EVAA) would provide for a 7% royalty to be collected from sales of certain works of art where the sale price exceeded $10,000. Half of this payment would go to the artist or successor in copyright, and half would go towards an escrow account to support U.S. non-profit museums.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov2012"/&gt; Both pieces of legislation are currently in committee. In conjunction with the consideration of the legislation, in September 2012 Congress published a Notice of Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/77fr58175.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; requesting comments from the public on factual and policy matters relating to a possible federal resale royalty right.

== Legal challenges ==
===Constitutionality as applied to out-of-state sales===
The Resale Royalty Act came under legal scrutiny when, in October 2011, a group of artists and their heirs filed class action suits against auction houses [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]], and auction site [[eBay]] for failure of those brokers to pay royalties per the Resale Act.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;"Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties." New York Times. November 1, 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/arts/design/artists-file-suit-against-sothebys-christies-and-ebay.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1337627198-6z6dl6UtRYpD8XktLU1fpg&lt;/ref&gt; In a decision&lt;ref&gt;http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on May 17, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen dismissed the suits on the grounds that the Resale Royalty Act violated the [[Commerce Clause]] of the United States Constitution, and was therefore invalid as law. (''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby’s Inc.'')&lt;ref name="case"&gt;[http://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/RecentPubOp.nsf/bb61c530eab0911c882567cf005ac6f9/c1e5a8ee236d7ae988257a02007034b6/$FILE/8604.pdf ''Estate of Graham, et al, v. Sotheby's Inc.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commerce Clause has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as not only affirmatively granting to Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but also, by negative implication, prohibiting the states from unjustifiably discriminating against or burdening the flow of interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; A state regulation violates the Commerce clause where it “directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

Judge Nguyen found that where the Act regulates any transaction in which the seller resides in California, regardless of the location of the sale, buyer, or artist, the Resale Royalty Act “explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine art occurring wholly outside California.”&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; The Court cited the example of a California resident placing a painting by a New York artist for sale with Sotheby's in New York, where at the subsequent auction the painting is bought by a New York resident.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt; In this instance, the California law requires the New York company to withhold the amount of the royalty from the sale price, and either locate and pay the artist in New York or remit payment to the California Arts Council should the artist not be located. Further, the Act permits the New York artist to sue the New York Sotheby's under California law should the auction house fail to collect and remit the applicable royalty to the artist.&lt;ref name="case"/&gt;

In 2015, an eleven-judge [[en banc]] panel of the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed, holding that applying the Act to out-of-state sales made by a California resident was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Eileen |title=California Court Resale Royalty Unconstitutional |url=https://news.artnet.com/market/court-restricts-california-resale-law-294993 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"&gt;''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/05/05/12-56067.pdf Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v.  Christies, Inc, et al.]'', no. 12-56067 (9th Cir. May 5, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The court struck the clause "the seller resides in California or" from the Act, declining to rule on whether the Act could otherwise be applied to sales made within California.&lt;ref name=ARTNET2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="12-56067"/&gt; In 2016, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declined [[certiorari]], leaving the Ninth Circuit decision in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boucher |first1=Brian |title=Supreme Court Declines Artist Royalties Appeal |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/supreme-court-declines-artists-resale-royalty-appeal-406106 |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Artnet News |date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-280.htm Sam Francis Foundation, et al. v. Christies, Inc., et al.]'', United States Supreme Court, no. 15-280 (docket). Accessed August 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preemption===
In April 2016, another federal judge, [[Michael W. Fitzgerald]], held the entire Act to be preempted by section 301 of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meier |first1=Henry |title=Federal Ruling Puts State Artist Royalty Law in Jeopardy |url=http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/apr/12/federal-ruling-puts-state-artist-royalty-law-jeopa/ |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Business Journal |date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Robert Graham, et al. v.

The '''Candy Desk''' has been a [[Traditions of the United States Senate|tradition]] of the [[United States Senate]] since 1968, whereby a senator who sits at a particular desk near a busy entrance keeps a drawer full of candy for members of the body. &lt;!--[THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE STATES THAT ALL THE OCCUPANTS HAVE BEEN REPUBLICANS, CANNOT FIND A SOURCE FOR AN 'ORIGINAL' DESK ON THE DEM SIDE:] The same desk has not always been used; the Candy Desk was moved to its present position on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] side of [[United States Senate Chamber|the chamber]] after over three decades on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] side, where it was used by several senators.--&gt; The current occupant of the Candy Desk is Pennsylvania Senator [[Pat Toomey]].

In 1965, California's [[George Murphy]] joined the Senate, and kept candy in his desk to offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating is not allowed on the Senate floor. When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican senators maintained the custom. The nascent tradition did not become publicly known until the mid-1980s, when Washington Senator [[Slade Gorton]] disclosed it in announcing that he would be sitting at the Candy Desk.

Senators who have maintained the Candy Desk tradition include [[John McCain]], [[Harrison Schmitt]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who stocked it with confectionery from his home state of Pennsylvania, including from the [[Hershey Chocolate Company]]. After Santorum left the Senate in 2007, the Candy Desk was maintained by a number of senators for a short time each, before Pennsylvania Senator Toomey began his stay in 2015.

==History==
[[File:GeorgeMurphy.jpg|thumb|[[George Murphy]], a one-term senator from California, is considered the founder of the candy desk tradition.]]

[[George Murphy]] [[United States Senate elections, 1964|was elected]] as the [[List of United States Senators from California|Senator from California]] in 1964, to take office the following year.&lt;ref name="Senate" /&gt; Murphy, known as a song-and-dance man from musicals such as ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'', ''[[Broadway Melody of 1940]]'' and ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'', had a taste for sweets. A short time after joining the Senate, he started keeping candy in his desk; then, in 1968, he moved desks and ended up at the spot where the Candy Desk is now situated. Since more senators now passed his desk on a daily basis, he started offering the contents of his desk to his colleagues. Senators who were invited to partake in the sweets started calling Murphy's desk the "candy desk". Murphy was defeated in the [[United States Senate elections, 1970|1970 Senate elections]], but subsequent senators have carried on the tradition of supplying candy in their desk for the enjoyment of the Senate as a whole.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;

[[Paul Fannin]], [[Harrison Schmitt]], [[Roger Jepsen]], and [[Steve Symms]] all continued the new candy desk tradition, in that order, after Murphy's one term was over. Fannin, Schmitt, and Jepsen supplied only hard candy, but Symms was the first to stock sweets supplied by "candy and chocolate associations."&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt; During the tenures of these senators, the candy desk was not fixed to one particular spot. Senate seating charts show Schmitt, during his time with the candy desk, sat one seat to the right of its traditional spot for the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]], and then sat across the aisle from the traditional spot for the [[96th United States Congress|96th]].&lt;ref name = "1977 directory" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "1979 directory" /&gt;

None of the above was publicly known until 1985, when [[Slade Gorton]] put out a press release stating "He was now the occupant of this desk and would carry on the rich traditions started by Murphy."&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt; He also named the past senators who had continued the tradition.&lt;ref name="Durant" /&gt;

In 1997, the candy desk was referenced by [[Kit Bond]] during a debate over the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for fiscal year 1998. He compared the sizes of microchips to candy he had taken from the desk.&lt;ref name = "Congressional Record" /&gt;

The high point, in terms of well-known candy, came during the ten years [[Rick Santorum]] sat at the candy desk (1997–2007). Being a senator from [[Pennsylvania]], he filled the candy desk with [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]] candy and [[Just Born]] products (such as [[Mike and Ike]] and [[Hot Tamales]]).&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; During this time period, Hershey shipped roughly 100 pounds of chocolate and other candy four times a year for Santorum to fill the desk.&lt;ref name = "Straub" /&gt; When Santorum did not win re-election during the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2006|2006 U.S. Senate elections]], Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Hershey, said about the company's no longer being able to supply sweets for the candy desk, "We were pleased to be a small part of sweetening up congressional proceedings."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Issues arose after Santorum was defeated for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator [[Craig L. Thomas|Craig Thomas]] began his tenure at the candy desk. [[Wyoming]], the state he was representing, has no members of the [[National Confectioners Association]], and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate [[Government ethics|ethics]] rules "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source,"&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; which can become a problem if a large amount of candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as [[Florida]] [[orange juice]] or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[peanut]]s."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, "We're happy to provide candy if there are [association] members...It would be difficult for us to do now."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and [[chocolatier]]s to give small amounts of candy that were rotated in and out of the desk.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

After Thomas's death in 2007, it was looked after by [[George Voinovich]] and then [[Mel Martinez]].&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; Both had relatively short tenures. In 2009, [[George LeMieux]], Martinez's successor, began sitting at the desk&lt;ref name="Miami" /&gt; and was there until he left the Senate in 2011. [[Mark Kirk]] of Illinois occupied the desk from 2011 to 2015.

==Location==

The candy desk is not a specific desk in the Senate Chamber, but rather a specific seating within the chamber, and any desk that the senator seated in that position chooses to use becomes the candy desk.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; The desk's location has remained static since at least the [[97th United States Congress|97th Congress]] (1981–1983). It is next to the eastern door to the senate chamber.&lt;ref name = "Kirk" /&gt; Most senators enter the chamber through this door, which is adjacent to elevators leading to one of the stops on the [[United States Capitol subway system]]. The desk is the first desk on the right, or Republican, side, and is in the last row of desks.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; Traditionally, the candy desk is always on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber and is used by a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="Skiba" /&gt;  Since 2015 the desk has been occupied by Pennsylvania Senator [[Pat Toomey]].&lt;ref name = "Villalpando" /&gt;
&lt;!--[THE FOLLOWING SECTION APPEARS ONLY TO REPEAT INFORMATION ALREADY SUPPLIED IN THE LEDE AND OTHER SECTIONS:]
==Candy==
The tenant of the candy desk is charged with stocking it with candy from his or her home state, but funding has been an issue. Originally senators would ask for a specific candy and leave a few dollars to keep the desk stocked with their favorites, but as time continued, and the candy desk became a more solid [[Traditions of the United States Senate|tradition of the Senate]], [[lobby groups]] and organizations, specifically the [[National Confectioners Association]] and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association (before their merger in 2008), organized donations.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;--&gt;

==Other candy desks==
The Democrats have also had a candy desk since at least 1985.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; A [[rolltop desk]] located on the front wall, belonging to the [[United States Senate Democratic Conference Secretary]], is also filled with sweets. This tradition began "sometime later" than the better known candy desk;&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; [[Hershey Kisses]] were the most popular candy from this desk during the 1980s, followed by small caramels.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee" /&gt; Candy for this desk is paid for through a "candy fund" to which senators who would like to partake of the desk's contents contribute.&lt;ref name="Compass" /&gt; Until he left the Senate in 2015, [[Jay Rockefeller]] was responsible for collecting the money and purchasing the candy. This tradition is not widely known; in fact, it is so little-known that the [[Historian of the United States Senate]] does not know much about it.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

Other senators sometimes keep candy in their desks as well. Katherine Buck, a [[United States Senate Page]] at the time, wrote the following in 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One senator with a particularly strong hankering for chocolate is [[Jim Talent]] from Missouri. Once during a vote, he called people away from the candy desk to his own on the other side of the row. There were oohs and aahs until six people walked away with Russell Stover Low-Carb Chocolates. (I guess the Atkins craze had made its way to the Senate.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, clothing is, and has been, made from many materials. These materials range from grasses to furs, to much more elaborate and exotic materials. Some cultures, such as the various people of the Arctic Circle, have made their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures have supplemented and replaced leather and skins with cloth. Cloth is either woven or knitted, and can be made from a large variety of [[fibers]], which in turn can be [[natural fiber|natural]], [[cellulose fiber|cellulose]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]].

Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to environmental hazards and the distinction between clothing and other protective equipment is not always clear-cut; examples include [[space suit]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suit]], [[swimsuit]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper's protective clothing]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and [[protective clothing]] in general.

==Clothing materials==
Clothing is generally made of cloth. There are many different types of cloth, with different names and uses. Main differences between types of cloth include how the cloth was made (woven, knitted, felted, and how those techniques were implemented), what fiber it was made from, and what weight the cloth is. Different types of cloth are used for different types of clothing.

Some common natural clothing materials are:
* Fabric made of [[cotton]], [[flax]], [[wool]], [[ramie]], [[silk]]
* [[Denim]]
* [[Leather]]
* [[Down feather|Down]] for down-filled [[Anorak|parka]]s
* [[Fur clothing|Fur]] 
Some are made from synthetic fibers, which are man made and generally not [[biodegradable]]. These are made primarily from [[petrochemical]]s.
Common man-made materials include:
* [[Nylon]] was first produced in 1935. Nylon is a [[thermoplastic]] silky material. It became famous when used in women's [[stocking]]s ("nylons") in 1940. It was intended to be a synthetic replacement for [[silk]] and substituted for it in many different products after silk became scarce during [[World War II]]. 
* [[Polyester]]s include naturally occurring chemicals and [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]]s. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Polyesters may change shape after the application of heat and are combustible at high temperatures. They tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers. 
* [[Spandex]] (elastane) is known for its exceptional [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. It is stronger and more durable than [[rubber]], its major non-synthetic competitor. It was [[invention|invented]] in 1959 by Charles Lewis French Jr. and Taylor.

Less-common clothing materials include:
* [[Acetate (clothing material)|Acetate]]
* [[Cupro (clothing material)|Cupro]]
* [[Flannel]]
* [[Lyocell]]
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-Polyvinyl chloride
* [[Rayon]]
* Recycled or Recovered [[Cotton]]
* Recycled [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]
* [[Paper recycling|Recycled bob]]
* [[Tyvek]]
* Other [[Natural Fiber]]s, including [[bamboo]], [[jute]], and [[hemp]]

Reinforcing materials such as [[wood]], [[bone]], [[plastic]] and [[metal]] may be used in [[fastener]]s or to stiffen garments.

'''Conceptual history''' (also the '''history of concepts''' or, from German, '''''Begriffsgeschichte''''') is a branch of historical and cultural studies that deals with the historical [[semantics]] of terms. It sees the [[etymology]] and the change in meaning of terms as forming a crucial basis for contemporary cultural, conceptual and linguistic understanding. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as "liberty" or "reform." It argues that [[social history]] – indeed all historical reflection – must begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time, not merely as unchanging ideologies or processes.

Interest in conceptual history was given a particular boost in the 20th century through the publication of the ''Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie'', the ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe'' and the journal [[Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte]].

Conceptual history is an [[interdisciplinary]] methodology. Alongside the [[philosopher]] [[Joachim Ritter]], the [[historian]]s [[Otto Brunner]] and  [[Reinhart Koselleck]] and the [[sociologist]] [[Erich Rothacker]] are viewed as the leading scholars of the research area in the German-speaking world and internationally. [[Raymond Williams]] is the leading scholar in the English-speaking world. Examples of conceptual histories include a genealogy of the concept of globalization drawing on the approach of Williams written by Manfred B. Steger and Paul James:

{{cquote|Although keywords represent a critical mass of the vocabulary of any given era, the history of their meaning construction often remains obscure. ‘Globalization’ is no exception. While the meanings of other seminal ‘keywords’ such as ‘economics’, ‘culture’, or ‘modernity’ evolved rather slowly and built upon a relatively continuous base, ‘globalization’ has had a very short and discontinuous history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 418–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">A '''cultural footprint''' is the impact that a group or individual has on the cultural environment.

== Definition ==
“Cultural footprint”&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used in work launched by the association Diversum (“Mesurer et améliorer son empreinte culturelle : nouvelle thématique du développement durable” [“Measuring and Improving One’s Cultural Footprint: The New Topic in Sustainable Development”], Jérôme Gouadain’s contribution to the [https://www.observatoireplurilinguisme.eu/fr/les-actions/assises-berlin-juin-2009-fr-fr-6-1/88888966--sp-161/2207-programme-et-contributions 2nd European Conference on Plurilingualism], Berlin, 19 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was defined in June 2013, at the initiative of a group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society.

They explained it as “all of the externalities, both positive and negative, generated in the cultural environment by agents’ actions”. It is considered to be positive when it enriches [[cultural diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt; or fosters cultural intensity.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;[http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 24 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reference document published in 2017 specified that “all actors have the possibility of activating (i.e. exploring and utilizing) available cultural resources. At the same time, it is their responsibility to make a positive contribution” to that sub-stratum, to that creative atmosphere. This means that groups and individuals must “set requirements for themselves, engage based on their own singularities, and be culturally involved and invested”.

== Applications ==
“The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; is a document to which Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé and Nicole Rouvet contributed. It suggests several aspects of the cultural environment where economics might be able to make a contribution: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">The term '''cultural lag''' refers to the notion that [[culture]] takes time to catch up with technological innovations, and that [[social problems]] and conflicts are caused by this lag. Subsequently, cultural lag does not only apply to this idea only, but also relates to theory and explanation. It helps by identifying and explaining social problems to predict future problems.

As explained by James W. Woodward, when the material conditions change, changes are occasioned in the adaptive culture, but these changes in the adaptive culture do not synchronize exactly with the change in the material culture, this delay is the culture lag.&lt;ref name=Woodward&gt;Woodard, James W. "Critical Notes on the Culture Lag Concept." Social Forces 12.3 (Mar. 1934): 388-398. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by sociologist [[William F. Ogburn]] in his 1922 work ''Social change with respect to culture and original nature.''&lt;ref name=Ogburn&gt;Ogburn, William F. Social change: With respect to cultural and original nature. Oxford England: Delta Books, 1966. PsycINFO. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of cultural lag suggests that a period of maladjustment occurs when the non-material culture is struggling to adapt to new material conditions.&lt;ref name=Schaefer&gt;Schaefer, Richard T. ''Sociology: A Brief Introduction 8th Edition.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This resonates with ideas of [[technological determinism]]. That is it can presuppose that technology has independent effects on society at large. However it does not necessarily assign causality to technology. Rather cultural lag focuses examination on the period of adjustment to new technologies. 

According to Ogburn, cultural lag is a common societal phenomenon due to the tendency of [[material culture]] to evolve and change rapidly and voluminously while non-material culture tends to resist change and remain fixed for a far longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Ogburn, William F. "Cultural Lag as Theory." Sociology &amp; Social Research 41.3 (Jan. 1957): 167-174. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the opposing nature of these two aspects of culture, adaptation of new technology becomes rather difficult. This distinction between material and non-material culture is also a contribution of Ogburn's 1922 work on social change.&lt;ref name="Ogburn"/&gt; 

Cultural lag creates problems for a society in a multitude of ways. The issue of cultural lag tends to permeate any discussion in which the implementation of some new technology is a topic. For example, the advent of stem cell research has given rise to many new, potentially beneficial medical technologies; however these new technologies have also raised serious ethical questions about the use of stem cells in medicine. Cultural lag is seen as a critical ethical issue because failure to develop broad social consensus on appropriate applications of modern technology may lead to breakdowns in social solidarity and the rise of social conflict.&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;Marshall, Kimball P. "Has Technology Introduced New Ethical Problems?." Journal of Business Ethics 19.1 (n.d.): 81-90. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Langsdale Library, Baltimore, MD. 30 Sep. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==
[[File:The Railway Museum 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A railway museum in Japan displays antique locomotives.]]
Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8369">'''Cultural practice''' generally refers to the manifestation of a [[culture]] or [[sub-culture]], especially in regard to the traditional and customary practices of a particular ethnic or other cultural group.  In the broadest sense, this term can apply to any person manifesting any aspect of any culture at any time.  However, in practical usage it often refers to the traditional practices developed within specific [[ethnic]] cultures, especially those aspects of culture that have been practiced since ancient times.

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over "rights of cultural practice", which are protected in many jurisdictions for [[indigenous peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canada/justice/ethnocultural-groups/ecg-003-00.html|title=Cultural Practices in Conflict with Canadian Law|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ethnic minorities.  It is also a major component of the field of [[cultural studies]], and is a primary focus of international works such as the [[United Nations]] declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180532/http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|title=oneFish Community Knowledge Directory|date=27 September 2011|publisher=www.onefish.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927234707/http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all.  International bodies such as the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of [[globalization]] questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUD7nh8S74C&amp;dq=globalization%20indigenous%20cultural%20practice&amp;pg=PA109&amp;ots=tFWPvlmt2t&amp;sig=UVDszTZyqoLl0inD8cLaBqRjvhc&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=globalization+indigenous+cultural+practice&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=3|title=Globalization: Culture and identity|first=Roland|last=Robertson|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415236911|editor1=Roland Robertson|editor2=Kathleen E.

==Qualifications==

The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate.  The question arises in controversial subject areas such as [[genital mutilation]], indigenous [[hunting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/message.aspx?&amp;mst=404|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Intensive gathering|gathering]] practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WD-huzL13PgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=native%20gathering%20rights&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6-ctah600m&amp;sig=7ZFC04KaQAmiTbXeWsVmhC1W39k#PPA8,M1|title=The Role of Customary Law in Sustainable Development|first=Peter|last=Orebech|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question of licensing of [[Traditional medicine|traditional medical practitioners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine in Chinese-American Communities|first=Conrad|last=Wang|publisher=www.camsociety.org|date=Fall 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021235131/http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|archivedate=2000-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/583/1/173.pdf|title=Traditional Medicine in Africa|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2002|volume=583|issue=1|pages=173–176|doi=10.1177/000271620258300111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00192826|title=The changing geography of traditional medicine: Urban herbalism on the Witwatersrand, South Africa|first=Rolf P.

Many traditional cultures acknowledge members outside of their ethnicity as cultural practitioners, but only under special circumstances.  Generally, the knowledge or title must be passed in a traditional way, such as family knowledge shared through [[adoption]], or through a master of that practice choosing a particular student who shows qualities desired for that practice, and teaching that student in a hands-on manner, in which they are able to absorb the core values and belief systems of the culture.  The degree to which these non-ethnic practitioners are able to exercise "customary and traditional" rights, and the degree to which their practice is acknowledged as valid, is often a subject of considerable debate among indigenous and other ethnic communities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw/argument.html]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes with the legal systems under which these communities function.  The difference between bona fide non-native cultural practitioners and cultural piracy, or [[cultural appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903191209/http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|archivedate=2005-09-03|publisher=earthcall.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a major issue within the study of [[globalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejcl.org/75/art75-7.html|title=Biotechnology, Patent Law and Piracy|volume=7|issue=5|first=Jerzy |last=Koopman|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[modernization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= indigenous cultures|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213204315/http://caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archivedate=2014-02-13|publisher=Caslon Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of culture==
The evolution of traditional cultures is a subject of much discussion in legal, scholarly, and community forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Saht_indig_way.html|title=Earthdance: Chapter 20 - The Indigenous Way|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally accepted that all cultures are to some degree in a continual state of [[sociocultural evolution]].  However, major questions surround the legitimacy of newly evolved cultural expressions, especially when these are influenced by [[modernization]] or by the influence of other cultures.  Also, there is significant debate surrounding the source of evolution: for example, an indigenous community may accept the use of store-bought materials in the creation of traditional arts, but may reject requirements to apply for a permit for certain gathering purposes; the central difference being that one is an ''internal'' cultural evolution, while the other is ''externally'' driven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/8152/Westernization-Africa.html|title=Westernization - Africa - Bibliography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the society or legal body that surrounds the culture.

==Legal==
{{main|Legal culture}}
A ''legal culture'' is a system of laws and precedents peculiar to a nation, region, religion, or other organized group. A culture gap occurs when incompatible or opposing systems might be applied to the same situation or assumed by the parties. Legal constructs such as contracts and corporations are not uniform across cultures. In some cases, such a gap is intentionally sought by one party, as in [[forum shopping]] for a more favorable legal framework or in [[libel tourism]], by which speech protected in one jurisdiction may be actionable in another.

== Generational ==
{{main|Generation gap}}

A ''generation gap'' occurs when the experiences and attitudes of one [[generation]] differ significantly from those of another. The [[world war]]s contributed to generation gaps in several nations. The term first saw widespread use in contrasting the [[Baby Boomer]] generation with their parents. The "Youth culture" of adolescents and teenagers seeking to stake out their own identity and independence from their parents often results in a cultural divide. Younger generations have experienced different technologies, freedoms and standards of propriety.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Falk and Ursula A. Falk ''Youth culture and the generation gap'' Algora Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|0-87586-368-X}}, 9780875863689

Communication between and collaboration among scientific disciplines is sometimes hindered by use of different paradigms or competition between the desires to describe a simple explanatory framework and elucidate fine details. The framework of the questions to which each field lends itself may differ, leading to frustration and wasted effort.&lt;ref name=Pasieka2002&gt;{{citation | last = Pasieka | first =  A | year = 2002 | title = Physics meets biology: Bridging the culture gap | journal = Nature | volume = 419 | pages = 244–246 | doi = 10.1038/419244a | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6904/full/419244a.html | pmid = 12239534 | issue = 6904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational ==
The education culture is the different education people receive in their life. A culture gap occurs when people with different cultures sit together and take the same class. Different cultures behave differently towards the teacher both in class and after class. Differences can be noticed in assessment method and the direction method of the class.

Asian students focus on books and exercises more than European and American students, who are willing to raise questions in the classes. The cultural gap in education is due to the different education traditions in different places.

For example, Asian students receive exam-oriented education, but European and American students receive a very different, freer education and are both expected to challenge their teachers and strongly encouraged to challenge the teachers in class.

In both China and Japan, the education system normally usually uses exams to show a student's ability. In American and Britain, students grade instructors according to ability.

Both systems have advantages and disadvantages but form a cultural gap between people. Different ways of thinking and analyzing things makes students view things very differently.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Y.; Zhou, X. &amp; Huang, L."&gt;{{citation | last = Zhao, Zhou, Huang | first =  Y., X., L. | year = 2008 | title = Chinese Students' Knowledge and Thinking about America and China | journal = Social Studies | volume = 99 | pages = 13–22 | issue = 1 | issn = 0037-7996 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=88f2f99c-112a-4636-a6ab-409da7ee2657%40sessionmgr13&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture.

Their usage can be seen in cultural expressions, [[phraseologism]]s, [[jokes]], [[slogan]]s, [[literature]], [[religion]], [[folklore]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], etc.&lt;ref name="elies"&gt;[http://elies.rediris.es/Language_Design/LD11/LD11-05-Lucia.pdf Luque Nadal, L.

Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in [[translation studies]] and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.&lt;ref name="elies" /&gt;

== Phases of a Cultureme ==

Fernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654436579|title=The Mutual interaction of people and their built environment : a cross-cultural perspective|last=|first=|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|others=Rapoport, Amos., International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (9th : 1973 : Chicago)|year=|isbn=9789027979094|location=The Hague|pages=265–274|oclc=654436579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase One: Basic Culturemes ===

'''Basic culturemes''' are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural "realms," '''urban''' and '''rural''', and two domains: exterior and interior.  Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions.  Within either cultures, there are '''exteriors''' (what is observed from the outside) and '''interiors''' (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective).  The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural-interior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance,

&lt;blockquote href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;"in ''North America'' (United States and Canada): the larger size of many automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=11|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Phase Two: Primary Culturemes ===
'''Primary culturemes''' exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into '''environmental''' (cultural settings) and '''behavioral''' (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and "experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48375754|title=Nonverbal communication across disciplines|last=Fernando.|first=Poyatos,|date=2002|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=1556197535|location=Amsterdam|pages=12|oclc=48375754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase Three: Secondary Culturemes ===
Culturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc.  These are '''secondary culturemes'''. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Phase Four: Tertiary Culturemes ===
Phase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible.  The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Translation ==
Translating a cultureme can be challenging, as [[connotation]]s are sometimes very strong. For instance: the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''alcázar'' means "the castle", "palace" or "fortress", but, as it is of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, it recalls eight centuries of history ([[Al Andalus]]), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word "fortress" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the [[loan word]] [[Alcázar|alcazar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum24/secciones/tritonos-3-culturemas.htm Translation of culturemes for tourism] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaskot|first=Maciej Paweł|last2=Ganoshenko|first2=Iurii|date=2015-12-31|title=Culturemes and Non-Equivalent Lexis in Dictionaries|url=https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/cs-ec/article/view/cs.2015.009|journal=Cognitive Studies {{!}} Études cognitives|language=|volume=|issue=15|pages=115–124|doi=10.11649/cs.2015.009|issn=2392-2397|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturemes are translated in several ways:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li href="Category:Articles with Spanish-language external links"&gt;Literal translation: Language of the cultureme is rendered in another language in attempts to convey the same core meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functional equivalence: Translating meaning without the inclusion of its cultural association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Near-synonymy: A translation has a similar meaning to the cultureme without being identical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under-specification: A space-saving technique that give a short and manageable definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distortion: A translation that does not preserve the same meaning as the cultureme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explanation: A translator uses this technique in their efforts to get the audience to fully understand the meaning. This can involve lengthy and overly detailed descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Category change: In the instance that the cultureme is obsolete or no longer relevant, a modern-day equivalent is provided.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glossary: A given text provides a definition at the end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li href="International Standard Book Number"&gt;Over-specification: More information is given than required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No translation: Some culturemes are kept in their original language. This applies mainly to [[Latin script|Roman script]] languages, though other languages may have their culturemes [[Romanization|romanized]].&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Omission: The translator may omit what they judge to be peripheral in what is meant to be said.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicolae|first=Adina Oana|date=2015|title=Multicultural dialogue: translating culturemes|url=|journal=Discourse as a Form of Multiculturalism in Literature and Communication|language=|volume=3|pages=215–222|doi=|isbn=978-606-8624-21-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Culture: Norms, Ideas, and Materials ===

In translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its "cultureme" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=603–621|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;li&gt;'''Norms''' refer to the habits and traditions of a societal group. A culture with a foundation of politeness that uses [[honorific]] terms of address, such as in the [[Korean language|Korean]] language, has very intricate forms of pronouns that have nonequivalence in other languages, e.g. English. Different cultures and languages have different interpretations of politeness that affects how successful a cultureme is translated. Traditional holidays are norms in a culture. The Vietnamese New Year ''[[Tết]]'' is a cultureme of the Vietnamese language and culture. ''Tết'' signifies the start of the new year on the [[Lunar calendar]]. It is a day of being home with family and cheerful celebration. A literal translation of ''Tết'' to English would be "New Year." But, anyone who had no knowledge of the cultureme would think the traditions and practices of "New Year's" all the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;*'''Ideas''' refer to "scientific truths, religious beliefs, myths, legends, works of literature, superstitions, aphorisms, proverbs, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyung-Eun|last2=Shin|first2=Keun-Hye|last3=Kim|first3=Ki-Sun|date=2015-12-01|title=Research on limitations of indirect literary translation and aspects of cultural vocabulary translation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|journal=Neohelicon|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=614|doi=10.1007/s11059-015-0298-5|issn=0324-4652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These culturemes are deep rooted in shared, personal history that outsiders of a culture are unfamiliar with knowing. Culturemes pertaining to cultural ideas do not need explained in the present, their meanings and significance are cemented in the people's knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Materials''' refer to physical culture. Food, for instance, is a important example of tangible culture; it can illustrate dietary culture/lifestyle. Certain dishes are staples of the culture and can be a product of the local surroundings. The existence of a food or dish may have historical relevance to a culture. Translation in recipes that involve food cultureme can result in the wrong ingredients being introduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna.  Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006. [http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20(koenig).pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101012859/http://www.yale.edu/yjhple/volume_1/pdf/033%20%28koenig%29.pdf |date=2006-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West, while [[Muslim world|Islamic nations]] and much of the former [[Soviet Union]] are, regardless of location, grouped in the East.&lt;ref name=Mestrovic&gt;{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than [[Asia]] and some parts of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the [[Americas]] into the [[Western world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil - Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013145/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417075124/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], the [[Philippines]],

== Identity politics ==

=== Asian concepts ===
{{cleanup|reason=The first paragraph in this section uses English words, but does not manage to make coherent English sentences. The second paragraph is mostly one run-on sentence.|date=April 2018}}
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An image of the "Eastern world" defined as [[Asia]]]]
Although the concept of a united Asian people and not mean [[Asian people|Asian race]] is even more debatable due to the fact that most of the world link the identity of Asian only to the people of South, East and Southeast Asia and so regions like [[Western Asia]] that who even though see themselves as part of the Eastern world such as the [[Arab world|Arab nations]] of Western Asia, [[Israel]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], and the ethnic groups that come along with these countries do not identify as Asian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] — the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] — the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] — a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] — the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.

{{political anthropology}}
'''Sir Edmund Ronald Leach''' (7 November 1910 &amp;ndash; 6 January 1989) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[social Anthropology|social anthropologist]].

==Early years==

===Personal life===
Leach was born in [[Sidmouth]], [[Devon]], the youngest of three children and the son of William Edmund Leach and Mildred Brierley. His father owned and was manager of a sugar plantation in northern [[Argentina]]. In 1940 Leach married [[Celia Buckmaster|Celia Joyce]] who was then a painter and later published poetry and two novels. They had a daughter in 1941 and a son in 1946.

===Education and career===
Leach was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with a BA with honours in Engineering in 1932.

After leaving Cambridge University, Leach took a four-year contract in 1933 with [[Butterfield and Swire]] in China, serving in [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], Chungking (now [[Chongqing]]), Tsingtao (now [[Qingdao]]), and Peking (now [[Beijing]]). He found out after his contract expired that he did not like the business atmosphere and never again was going to sit on an office stool. He intended to return to England by way of Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway, but increasing political turmoil in Russia convinced him otherwise. While in Peking, Leach had a chance encounter with Kilton Stewart, a psychiatrist, former-Mormon missionary, and published author who invited him on a trip to the island of Botel Tobago off the coast of Formosa. And so, on his way home Leach spent several months among the [[Yami people|Yami]] of [[Orchid Island|Botel Tobago]], an island off the coast of [[Formosa]]. Here he took ethnographic notes and specifically focused his efforts on local boat design. This work resulted in a 1937 article in the anthropology journal ''Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2790297|title = 220.

He returned to England and studied social anthropology at the [[London School of Economics]] with [[Raymond Firth]] who introduced him to [[Bronisław Malinowski]]. He was an active member of Malinowski's "famous seminar".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBfBkGvRmowC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Edmund%20Leach%3A%20An%20Anthropological%20Life&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Edmund Leach: An Anthropological Life|isbn=9780521521024|last1=Tambiah|first1=Stanley Jeyaraja|last2=Tambiah|first2=Stanley J|date=2002-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Leach went to Iraq (Kurdistan) to study the Kurds, which resulted in ''Social and Economic Organization of the Rowanduz Kurds''.&lt;ref&gt;http://libarch.nmu.org.ua/handle/GenofondUA/22029&lt;/ref&gt; However, he abandoned this trip because of the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Crisis]]. He wrote: "I’ve got an enormous amount of ability at almost anything, yet so far I’ve made absolutely no use of it… I seem to be a highly organized piece of mental apparatus for which nobody else has any use" ([[Dictionary of National Biography|D.N.B.]] 258).

In 1939 he was going to study the [[Kachin Hills]] of Burma, but [[World War II]] intervened. Leach then joined the Burma Army, from the fall of 1939 to summer 1945, where he achieved the rank of Major.  During his time in Burma, Leach acquired superior knowledge of Northern Burma and its many hill tribes. In particular, he grew very familiar with the Kachin people, even serving as commander of the Kachin irregular forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBfBkGvRmowC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Edmund%20Leach%3A%20An%20Anthropological%20Life&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Edmund Leach: An Anthropological Life|isbn=9780521521024|last1=Tambiah|first1=Stanley Jeyaraja|last2=Tambiah|first2=Stanley J|date=2002-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the publication of the "Jinghpaw Kinship Terminology: An Experiment in Ethnographic Algebra" in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2844281|title = Jinghpaw Kinship Terminology|journal = The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume = 75|issue = 1/2|pages = 59|last1 = Leach|first1 = E. R|doi = 10.2307/2844281|year = 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he left the Army in 1946, he returned to the [[London School of Economics]] to complete his dissertation under the supervision of Raymond Firth. In spring of 1947 he received a Ph.D. in anthropology. His 732-page dissertation was based on his time in Burma and titled ''Cultural change, with special reference to the hill tribes of Burma and Assam''.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.579421&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/665/1/Leach_Cultural_change.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, at the request of Sir Charles Arden Clark, the then Governor of Sarawak (then under British Colonial rule) and a referral by Raymond Firth, the British Colonial Social Science Research Council invited Leach to conduct a major survey of the local peoples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.borneoresearchcouncil.org/BRB%20PDF%20scans/BRB_1989_21_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting 1948 report, ''Social Science Research in Sarawak'' (later published in 1950), was used as a guide for many well-known subsequent anthropological studies of region. In addition to the report, Leach produced five additional publications from this field work. Upong returning from his fieldwork in Borneo, Leach became a lecturer at LSE.

In 1951, Leach won the Curl Essay Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.therai.org.uk/awards/past-awards/curl-essay-prize-past-awards|title=Curl Essay Prize Past Awards|website=www.therai.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his essay ''The Structural Implications of Matrilateral Cross-Cousin Marriage,'' which drew on his extensive data on the Kachin to make important theoretical points as it related to kinship theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leach|first=E. R.|date=1951-01-01|title=The Structural Implications of Matrilateral Cross-Cousin Marriage|jstor=2844015|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=81|issue=1/2|pages=23–55|doi=10.2307/2844015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, he became a lecturer at [[Cambridge University]], and promoted to Reader in 1957.

Along with his wife, Celia, Leach spent a year from 1960 to 1961 at the Center for Advanced Study of Behavioral Studies in Palo Alto, California. Here he met Roman Jakobson, the Russian linguist, popularizer of Saussurean structural linguistics, and a major influence on the theoretical thinking of Levi-Strauss, leading to his structural anthropology.

In 1972 receiving a personal Chair. He was elected [[provost (education)|provost]] of [[King's College, Cambridge]] in 1966 and retired in 1979; President of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] (1971–1975); a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] (from 1972) and was [[British honours system#Knighthood|knighted]] in 1975.

==Academic contributions==

Leach spanned the gap between British structural-functionalism (exemplified by Radcliffe-Brown and Malinowski), and French structuralism (exemplified by Levi-Strauss). Despite being a central interpreter of Levi-Strauss' work, producing several introductory works on Levi-Strauss' theoretical perspective, Leach considered himself "at heart, still a 'functionalist'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k-G5p1UnsvsC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=edmund%20leach&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Claude Levi-Strauss|last=Leach|first=Edmund|date=1989-10-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226469683|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Lévi-Strauss'' was translated into six languages and ran three editions. His turn of phrase produced memorable quotes, such as this on Lévi-Strauss:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The outstanding characteristic of [Lévi-Strauss's writing], whether in French or English, is that it is difficult to understand; his sociological theories combine baffling complexity with overwhelming erudition. Some readers even suspect that they are being treated to a confidence trick".&lt;ref name="Leach1974"&gt;{{citation|title=Claude Levi-Strauss|year=1974|author=Leach, Edmund|page=3|edition=Revised|place=New York|publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leach's work on Lévi-Strauss is often relied on by other authors. For example, in [[Richard Wrangham]]'s (2009) book ''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]'', he relies on Leach in describing Lévi-Strauss's analysis of cooking in relation to human culture.&lt;ref name="Wrangham2009"&gt;{{citation|title=Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human|year=2009|author=Wrangham, Richard|authorlink=Richard Wrangham|place=New York|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01362-3|title-link=Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leach's first book was ''Political Systems of Highland Burma'' (1954); it challenged the theories of social structure and cultural change. Throughout, Leach was "fiercely critical of generalisations from one society to a narrative about 'politics' in so-called 'primitive societies'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Epistemology as Politics and the Double-Bind of Border Thinking: Lévi-Strauss, Deleuze and Guattari, Mignolo | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Portal: Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 1–20 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book was ''Pul Eliya, a Village in Ceylon'' (1961), where he directed his attention to [[kinship#Recognition of fluidity in kinship meanings and relations|theories of kinship]] as ideal systems. Leach's interest in kinship was first exemplified by his 1951 article (which won the Curl Essay Prize), and it was here that he first cites Levi-Strauss, disagreeing with several aspects of the latter's kinship theory outlined in ''[[The Elementary Structures of Kinship|Elementary Structures of Kinship]]''. Leach applied his analysis of kinship to his disagreement with Lévi-Strauss in ''Pul Eliya'', introducing Levi-Strauss's work into British social anthropology in doing so.

'''''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''''', 1st ed., 2012, is a comprehensive, multi-volume, English language encyclopedia of [[Hinduism]], comprising ''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'', a [[Sanskrit]] phrase, meaning "the eternal [[dharma|law]]", or the "eternal way", that is used to refer to Hinduism, [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|title=Hinduism is an intellectual system, not religion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423060143/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Hinduism-is-an-intellectual-system-not-religion/Article1-899317.aspx|archivedate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 7,184 page, 11-volume publication with full-color illustrations of temples, places, thinkers, rituals and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rupapublications.com/client/Book/Encyclopedia-of-Hinduism.aspx|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism Ed. Dr. Kapil Kapoor|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Rupa &amp; Co.]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is an inspiration and dream project of Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], President of [[Parmarth Niketan]] and India Heritage Research Foundation. Under preparation for 25 years, it has been edited by Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]] with contribution from over 2000 scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Sunday Tribune - Books | url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120219/spectrum/book1.htm | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopaedia provides conceptual perspective and a general understanding of the different facets of Hinduism. It does not confine itself to religion alone, and has in it entries on art, history, language, literature, philosophy, polity, sciences, and women's studies. The editorial introduction records:

:"This encyclopaedia has been prepared to give a fairly comprehensive idea of an ancient way of life, a culture that has roots going back thousands of years and has been called ‘Hinduism’ in the last two hundred years of English discourse. It is a book of knowledge about facts, theories, systems, practices, institutions, beliefs, texts, thinkers and values of, what in fact is, a continuity of one of the two living knowledge cultures of the world, the Vedic (Semitic being the other). Hindu society has been a ‘knowledge society’  in its proper sense for at least 5000 years: the word ‘Veda’ itself means ‘knowledge'."

On 3–4 April 2010, a preview and blessings ceremony for the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was held at Parmarth Niketan, attended by [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]], M.M. Swami Gurusharananand, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, [[Ramesh Oza|Sant Shri Rameshbhai Oza]], [[Ramdev|Swami Ramdev]], [[Morari Bapu|Sant Shri Morari Bapu]] and other religious leaders as well as top political leaders, including [[L. K. Advani|Shri L.K. Advani]] and then-Chief Minister of Uttarakhand [[Ramesh Pokhriyal|Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank]], and IHRF board members and trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parmarth.com/updates/april2010.pdf April 2010 Special Newsletter] Parmarth Niketan&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Edition of the ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was launched at the University of South Carolina on 26 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=6353#.VA7HJ2O6-Yg "USC to launch ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' Aug. 26"] University of South Carolina News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/multimedia/2013/08/130827_encyclopedia_hinduism_gal_sb.shtml 25 बरसों में संजोया हिन्दू धर्म का विश्वकोश] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/25-years-making-hindu-encyclopedia-complete 25 Years in Making, Hindu Encyclopedia Complete] Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' was presented to the President of India [[Pranab Mukherjee|Shri Pranab Mukherjee]] on 23 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=0 President of India receives a copy of ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''] Press Information Bureau, Government of India, President's Secretariat, Press Release 23-06-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inception ==
The idea was conceived by Swami [[Chidanand Saraswati]], president of [[Parmarth Niketan]] Ashram, at a Hindu-Jain Temple in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1987. Subsequently, in November of the same year, the India Heritage Research Foundation was formed to execute the idea of preparing an authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =A Landmark Publication - Shri L. K. Advani | url =http://blog.lkadvani.in/blog-in-english/a-landmark-publication | accessdate = 5 March 2013| publisher=[[L. K. Advani]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao, Professor Emeritus in Religious Studies at University of Virginia was appointed the Chief Editor.

== Development == 
Over the next five years, Swami Chidanand Saraswati and Dr. K. L. Seshagiri Rao assembled an international team of scholars. In 1998, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], Prime Minister of India at the time, spoke effusively in praise of the project:

:"Your undertaking is rightly called the 'Project of the Third Millennium.’ This is a monumental undertaking.  It is indeed a [[Jnana]] [[Yajna]].  Hence, all those who have offered their time, talent and scholarship as ahuti for the success of this [[Yajna]] deserve our heartiest applause and felicitations."

In early 2006, Dr. [[Kapil Kapoor]], Professor of English and Concurrent Professor of Sanskrit Studies who had retired as rector for [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]], Delhi the previous year, was appointed chief editor of the project.

== Foreword ==
The first volume of the encyclopedia contains a 44-page foreword by Dr. [[Karan Singh]]. In the opening paragraph, he writes:

:"Hinduism calls itself the Sanatana Dharma, the eternal faith, because it is based not upon the teachings of a single preceptor but on the collective wisdom and inspiration of great seers and sages from the very dawn of Indian civilization."

The closing comments of Dr. Singh's forward begin with the following note:

:"The long awaited publication of a massive eleven-volume ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'' is a major publishing event. Many years of scholarship, organization and devotion have gone into the preparation of what will be a landmark in the history of Hindu research."

== Reviews == 
Indrajit Hazra, writing for ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', said its "entries are crisp, provide background and foreground, and come with a bibliography." The review goes on to add:

:"The production is excellent, as is the quality of images that are scattered across the volumes. With entries that include the ''Dhammapada'' (the main text of Theravada Buddhism), the 'Chipko movement' (the organised environmental movement to resist the destruction of forests in India'), as well as the 'Saura Mandala' (solar system), clearly, this is an encyclopedia that doesn't define 'Hinduism' in any narrow, proselytising way."

Hazra concludes his review by calling the encyclopedia "a startlingly good treasure trunk for anyone interested in the history of ideas to dip into." Former Home Minister of India [[L.K. Advani]] called the work "a landmark publication."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2437">'''Forefathers' Day''' is a [[holiday]] celebrated in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], on December 22. It is a commemoration of the landing of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on December 21, 1620. It was introduced in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1769.

Forefathers Day' is celebrated every year by the [[Old Colony Club]], established in 1769 "to honor the forefathers". The celebration begins at 6:00 AM with a march by members to the top of Cole's Hill next to Massasoit's statue, followed by a reading of a proclamation honoring the forefathers and a ritual firing of the club's cannon. 
 
The Old Colony Club and the [[Mayflower Society]] both include a [[succotash]] dinner as part of their celebration. Sauquetash was recorded as a part of the first Thanksgiving.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Unlike later versions of succotash, in Plymouth succotash is served as a broth containing large pieces of fowl and meat that are sliced at the table.   

When the 22nd falls on a Sunday, the Old Colony Club celebrates Forefathers Day' on the following Monday. 

There is some good-hearted dispute between the Old Colony Club and the Mayflower Society. The simple fact of the celebration falling on separate days permits members of both societies to participate in both celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, James W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AL6-pCFBc28C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=Forefathers+Day+1769&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WRbHTOrvKMqYOo_99N8B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Forefathers%20Day%201769&amp;f=false ''Thanksgiving: The Biography of an American Holiday'']. Durham, NH: University of New Hampshire Press, 2009: 63&lt;/ref&gt; In adjusting the date to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the anniversary was erroneously established on December 22 instead of December 21.&lt;ref&gt;Marden, Orison Swett and Devitt, George Raywood.

'''Generation text''' is a term referring to those members of society who have grown up with [[cell phones]] from a young age. Furthermore, it can be applied to [[adolescent]]s and [[teenagers]] who feel that they are unable to function without a cell phone.

==Creation of the term==
The term ''generation text'' has been created by several people independently. Dr. [[Michael Osit]] published a book in 2008 called "Generation Text".
A second invention of the word occurred in 2009 at a [[Lights (musician)|Lights]] concert in Winnipeg, Canada by [[Ian Scott (Manitoba politician)|Ian Scott]]. While at the concert, Scott observed that many of the teenagers were either talking on their cell phones, [[text messaging]], or videoing concert footage using their phones. Also noticing that they appeared to be all of one specific generation, he coined the term "generation text".

'''Habis''' (from the [[Cynete]] language meaning [[fawn]]) is a legendary king of the Spanish region of [[Tartessos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hérnuñez|first1=Pollux|title=Mitos, héroes y monstruos de la España antigua|publisher=Amaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to legend, Habis's story began when his mother was stung by a bee. Her father, the king of Tartessos, hurried to heal her. As he knelt to soften her wound with his mouth, a passion came over both, thus procreating the baby. Due to the shame of having committed [[incest]], the king ordered the child to be abandoned on the prairies outside the kingdom. Eventually the boy was raised by the deer in there, acquiring deer features. He was later found and recognized as the true heir to the kingdom, and later accordingly named.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elfarodemalaga.es/index.php?id=portada&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green insect on hand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Spanish Fly", ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'' has been considered to have medicinal, [[aphrodisiac]], and other properties&lt;!--, though it contains an irritant chemical, [[cantharidin]], which is certainly toxic--&gt;.]]
'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects. [[Food]] is the most studied topic in ethnoentomology, followed by [[medicine]] and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posey |first1=Darrell Addison |title=Topics And Issues In Ethnoentomology With Some Suggestions For The  Development Of Hypothesis-Generation And Testing In Ethnobiology |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=99–120 |url=https://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801192909/http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crop Duster.jpg|thumb|upright|Fighting insects: an [[agricultural aircraft]] applies low-[[insecticide]] bait to kill [[western corn rootworm]]s.]]

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and costs==

===Insect ecosystem services===
[[File:Honeybee (Apis mellifera) pollinating Avocado cv.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]], here by a bee on an [[avocado]] crop, is an [[ecosystem service]].]]

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]].

{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting. ''Entomologie Heute 20: 3–25''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid water boatman eggs are sought out as a form of [[caviar]] by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]]. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Ramos-Elorduy de Concini, J. and J.M. Pino Moreno. (1988). The utilization of insects in the empirical medicine of ancient Mexicans. ''Journal of Ethnobiology, 8(2), 195–202.''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was applied in both [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) and in [[Ayurveda]]. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, [[centipede]] is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions,&lt;ref name="centipede"&gt;http://tcm.health-info.org/Herbology.Materia.Medica/wugong-properties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, ''[[Polyrhachis]] vicina'', is used as a cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1809450.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurveda uses insects such as [[Termite]] for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The [[Jatropha]] leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Nyishi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting"&gt;Srivastava, S.K., Babu, N., and H. Pandey. (2009). Traditional insect bioprospecting—As human food and medicine. ''Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge, 8(4):'' 485–494.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised.&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used [[Army ant]] soldiers as living [[Surgical suture|suture]]s.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The venom of the [[Red harvester ant]] was used to cure [[rheumatism]], [[arthritis]], and [[poliomyelitis]] via the immune reaction produced by its sting.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; Boiled ''[[Bombyx mori|silkworm]]'' pupae were taken to treat [[apoplexy]], aphasy, [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], convulsions, [[haemorrhage]]s, and frequent urination.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;

[[Honey bee]] products are used medicinally in [[apitherapy]] across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, despite the fact that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal.  They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is [[honey]].&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns,&lt;ref name="China"&gt;Feng, Y., Zhao, M., He, Z., Chen, Z., and L.

It is taken hot to treat [[common cold|colds]], [[cough]], throat infections, [[laryngitis]], [[tuberculosis]], and lung diseases.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; [[Apitoxin]] (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, [[polyneuritis]], and [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;  [[Propolis]], a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by [[menopausal]] women because of its high [[hormone]] content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; [[Royal jelly]] is used to treat [[anaemia]], [[gastrointestinal ulcer]]s, arteriosclerosis, [[hypotension|hypo]]- and [[hypertension]], and inhibition of sexual [[libido]].&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;  Finally [[Bee bread]], or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; One of the major [[peptide]]s in bee venom, [[Melittin]], has the potential to treat [[inflammation]] in sufferers of [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="N.A.

Insects play an important role in biological research.

Insects feature in folklore around the world. In China, farmers traditionally regulated their crop planting according to the [[Jingzhe|Awakening of the Insects]], when temperature shifts and monsoon rains bring insects out of hibernation.

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

{{main article|Insects in art}}

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' was written by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], in 1899–1900, as part of his opera, ''The Tale of Tsar of Saltan''.

"The Bug Nebula", also called "The Butterfly Nebula", is a more recent discovery. Known as [[NGC 6302]] is one of the brightest and most popular stars in the universe – popular in that its features draw the attention of a lot of researchers.  It happens to be located in the [[Scorpius]] constellation.  It is perfectly bipolar, and until recently, the central star was unobservable, clouded by gas, but estimated to be one of the hottest in the galaxy – 200,000 degrees Fahrenheit, perhaps 35 times hotter than our Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matsuura, M. |author2=Zijlstra, A.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.  Such reliefs might have indicated towns and villages that produce honey. Modern Mayan authorities say the figure also have a connection to modern cosmology. Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the "Second Sun." The relief might be indicative of another "insect deity", that of Xux Ex, the Mayan "wasp star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter |first=C.

[[Ovo (Cirque du Soleil)|Ovo]] is an insect-themed production by the world renowned Canadian entertainment company [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The show looks at the world of insects and its biodiversity where they go about their daily lives until a mysterious egg appears in their midst, as the insects become awestruck about this iconic object that represents the enigma and cycles of their lives. The costuming was a fusion of arthropod body types blended with superhero armour. Liz Vandal, the lead costume designer, has a special affinity for the world of the insect:&lt;ref name=Cirque/&gt;

{{quote|When I was just a kid I put rocks down around the yard near the fruit trees and I lifted them regularly to watch the insects who had taken up residence underneath them. I petted caterpillars and let butterflies into the house.

The term '''first-generation''' may refer either to a person who has immigrated to a new country and been [[naturalized]], or to the children of such an immigrant. The term '''second-generation''' consequently may refer to either the children or the grandchildren of such an immigrant. The terms are used interchangeably because of the ambiguity between them.

According to the [[Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]] a "First-generation" is
# "born in the U.S. -used of an American of immigrant parentage"
# "foreign-born -used of a naturalized citizen"

== First generation ==
The term '''first-generation''', as it pertains to a person's nationality or residency in a country, has two incompatible meanings:
*A [[jus soli|native-born]] citizen or resident of a country whose parents are foreign born, ''or'' a foreign-born citizen whose parents immigrated when that person was very young, that is, the first native-born generation.
*A [[foreign born]] citizen or resident who has immigrated to a new country of residence, that is, the first generation to immigrate.

This ambiguity is captured and corroborated in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s definition of "[[generation]]":

:''...designating a member of the first (or second, etc.) generation of a family to do something or live somewhere; spec. designating a '''naturalized immigrant or a descendant of immigrant parents''', esp. in the United States....'' (''OED'' definition of "generation," section 6b., the term "first generation" is used to refer to foreign-born residents (excluding those born abroad of American parents).&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nation's Foreign-Born Population Nears 37 Million |url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/foreignborn_population/cb10-159.html |work=Press Release |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=31 January 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no universal consensus on which of these meanings is always intended.

== 1.5 generation ==
The term '''1.5 generation''' or '''''1.5G''''' refers to individuals who [[immigration|immigrate]] to a new country before or during their early [[adolescence|teens]]. They earn the label the "''1.5 generation''" because they bring with them or maintain characteristics from their home country, meanwhile engaging in assimilation and socialization with their new country. Oftentimes, in the case of small children, a battle of linguistic comprehension occurs between their academic language and the language spoken at home.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, C. (2011). "The progressive past: How history can help us serve generation 1.5". Reference &amp; User Service Quarterly, 51(1). 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Their identity is, thus, a combination of new and old culture and tradition.  Sociologist Ruben Rumbaut was among the first to use the term to examine outcomes among those arriving in the United States before adolescence, but since then the term has expanded to include foreign students, as well as other unique individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Leslie Berenstein|title=Introducing the cultural mashup dictionary: Our first term, 1.5 generation|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/04/07/7099/introducing-the-cultural-mashup-dictionary-our-fir/|work=Article|publisher=Southern California Public Radio|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the age of immigration, the community where they settle, extent of education in their native country, and other factors, 1.5 generation individuals identify with their countries of origin to varying degrees. However, their identification is affected by their experiences growing up in the new country. 1.5G individuals are often bilingual and find it easier to assimilate into local culture and society than people who immigrate as adults.
Many 1.5 generation individuals also, become bi-cultural, combining both cultures - culture from the country of origin with the culture of the new country.

== Second generation ==
The term "'''second-generation'''" extends the concept of ''first-generation'' by one generation. As such, the term exhibits the same type of ambiguity as "first-generation," as well as additional ones.

Like "first-generation immigrant," the term "second-generation" can refer to a member of either:
*The second generation of a family to inhabit, but the first natively born in, a country, ''or''
*The second generation born in a country

In the United States, among demographers and other social scientists, [[Second-generation immigrants in the United States|"second generation"]] refers to the U.S.-born children of foreign-born parents.&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau"/&gt;

The term ''second-generation immigrant'' attracts criticism due to it being an [[oxymoron]]. Namely, critics say, a "second-generation immigrant" is not an immigrant, since being "second-generation" means that the person is born in the country and the person's ''parents'' are the immigrants in question. Generation labeling immigrants is further complicated by the fact that immigrant generations may not correspond to the genealogical generations of a family. For instance, if a family of two parents and their two adult children immigrate to a new country, members in both generations of this family may be considered "first generation" by the former definition, as both parents and children were foreign-born, adult, immigrants. Likewise, if the two parents had a third child later on, this child would be of a different immigrant generation from that of its siblings. For every generation, the factor of mixed-generation marriages further convolutes the issue, as a person may have immigrants at several different levels of his or her ancestry.

These ambiguities notwithstanding, generation labeling is frequently used in parlance, news articles [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070918.OECD18/TPStory/National], and reference articles without deliberate clarification of [[birthplace]] or [[naturalization]]. It may or may not be possible to determine, from context, which meaning is intended.

== 2.5 generation ==
When demographers and other social scientists in the United States use the term "second generation," they usually refer to people with one foreign-born parent. Likewise, Statistics Canada defines second generation persons as those individuals who were born in Canada and had at least one parent born outside
Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-010-x/99-010-x2011003_2-eng.cfm | title = Generation status: Canadian-born children of immigrants | last =Statistics Canada | date =2013 | publisher = Minister of Industry, Government of Canada | access-date = 2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have begun to question whether those with one native-born parent and those with no native-born parents should be lumped together, with evidence suggesting that there are significant differences in identities and various outcomes between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan|first=S.

== 1.75 and 1.25 generations ==
[[Rubén G. Rumbaut]] has coined the terminology "1.75 generation" and "1.25 generation" immigrants, for children who are closer to birth or full adulthood when they immigrate.&lt;ref name="rumbaut"&gt;Rumbaut, Rubén. ''Ages, Life Stages, and Generational Cohorts: Decomposing the Immigrant First and Second Generations in the United States. p. 1167’’ http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1887924 Retrieved December 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who arrive in their early childhood (ages 0 to 5) are referred to as 1.75 generation immigrants since their experiences are closer to a true 2nd-generation immigrant who was born in the country they live in: they retain virtually no memory of their country of birth, were too young to go to school to learn to read or write in the parental language in the home country, typically learn the language of the country they immigrate to without an accent and are almost entirely socialized there. Children who arrive in their adolescent years (ages 13–17) are referred to as 1.25 generation immigrants because their experiences are closer to the first generation of immigrants adults than to the native born second generation.&lt;ref name="rumbaut" /&gt;

Most immigrant youth tends to have higher academic accomplishment at all levels, at times even having greater levels of [[post-secondary education]] than their parents and grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marks|first=Amy K.|last2=Ejesi|first2=Kida|last3=[[Cynthia García Coll|García Coll]]|first3=Cynthia|date=2014-06-01|title=Understanding the U.S. Immigrant Paradox in Childhood and Adolescence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdep.12071/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=59–64|doi=10.1111/cdep.12071|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to explain this phenomenon, there are several factors that are noticeable:
# Immigrant children usually have more in the way of family obligation than children not born of immigrants, so they are more likely feel pressure to study seriously at school and gain the ability to provide for their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geel|first=Mitch van|last2=Vedder|first2=Paul|date=2009-10-27|title=The Role of Family Obligations and School Adjustment in Explaining the Immigrant Paradox|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-009-9468-y|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/s10964-009-9468-y|issn=0047-2891|pmc=3018245|pmid=19859793}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Optimism—the idea that if they put in the work that they'll achieve [[social mobility]] in the host nation—is also an important factor that motivates immigrant generations to work hard and succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Nancy E.|last2=Torres|first2=Kathryn|date=2010-03-01|title=Negotiating the American Dream: The Paradox of Aspirations and Achievement among Latino Students and Engagement between their Families and Schools|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01635.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|pages=95–112|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01635.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Most immigrant generations learn their mother tongue alongside the local [[national language]](s) of their host country.

'''Jake the Alligator Man''' is an alleged half-man, half-[[alligator]] creature on display in apparently [[Mummy|mummified]] condition at Marsh's Free Museum, a [[tourist trap]] located at 409 South Pacific Avenue in [[Long Beach, Washington]].

Johnny Reb is usually pictured in gray wool uniform with the typical [[kepi]]-style [[forage cap]] made of wool [[broadcloth]] with a rounded, flat top, cotton lining, and leather visor. He is often shown with his weapons and with the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Confederate flag|Confederate flag]].

{{About|childbirth|other uses|Lying in (disambiguation)}}
'''Lying-in''' is the term given to the European forms of [[postpartum confinement]], the traditional practice involving long [[bed rest]] after giving birth. The term and the practice it describes are old-fashioned or [[archaism|archaic]], but it used to be considered an essential component of the [[postpartum period]], even if there were no medical complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7129/pg7129-images.html The Prospective Mother: A Handbook for Women During Pregnancy], [[J. Morris Slemons]] 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1932 publication refers to lying-in as ranging from two weeks to two months.&lt;ref name="Nusche"&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/167/6/675 Lying in by Jan Nusche] quoting ''The Bride's Book — A Perpetual Guide for the Montreal Bride'', published in 1932&lt;/ref&gt;  It also does not suggest "Getting Up" (getting out of bed post-birth) for at least nine days and ideally for 20 days.&lt;ref name="Nusche"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenstad, Janelle Day, ''Lying-in Like a Countess: The Lisle Letters, the Cecil Family, and A Chaste Maid in Cheapside'', Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies - Volume 34, Number 2, Spring 2004, pp. 373-403&lt;/ref&gt; Care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law), or, for those who could afford it, by a temporary worker called the [[monthly nurse]]. These weeks ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. When lying-in was a more common term, it was used in the names of several [[maternity hospital]]s, for example the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] in London.

Women received congratulatory visits from friends and family during the period, and among many traditional customs around the world the ''[[desco da parto]]'' was a special form of painted tray presented to the mother in [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]].  The many scenes painted on these trays show female visitors bringing presents, received by the mother in bed, while other women tend to the baby.  No fixed term of lying-in is recommended in Renaissance manuals on family life (unlike in some other cultures), but it appears from documentary records that the mother was rarely present at the [[baptism]], in Italian cities usually held within a week of the birth at the local [[parish church]], normally a few minutes' walk from any house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/renaissance-childbirth/ "Renaissance childbirth"], [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In art, the immensely popular scene of the ''[[Nativity of Christ in art|Birth of Jesus]]'' technically shows the Virgin Mary, who reclines on a couch in most medieval examples, lying-in, but in famously un-ideal conditions.  More ideal images of lying-in in well-off households are represented in the subjects, also popular, of the ''[[Birth of the Virgin]]'' and ''[[Birth of John the Baptist]]''.  These are generally given contemporary settings, and differ little from other images that are purely secular, especially those on ''desci da parto''.

mainzed is based on different long-term cooperations between various institutions in Mainz. The research and development institution for digital humanities of the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz, ''Digitale Akademie'', was founded in 2009 and is connected to the Institute of Historical Regional Studies at the University of Mainz, the Leibniz Institute of European History and the universities of Mainz. Since 1997, the Romano-Germanic Central Museum Mainz and the i3mainz – Institute for Spatial Information and Surveying Technology have operated the ''Competence Centre for Spatial Information Technology in the Humanities'' at the Mainz University of Applied Sciences. In autumn 2013, the informal ''Network DHMainz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forum DHMainz: Kompetenz-Marktplatz für digitale Geisteswissenschaften {{!}} i3mainz|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/pressemitteilungen/ForumDHMainz2014|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created with the help of the Mainz Research Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homepage of Mainz Research Alliance |periodical= |publisher= |url=https://www.wissenschaftsallianz-mainz.de/en/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-05-22 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language= |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network was responsible for the preparation of the Digital Humanities Day 2014 in Mainz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Humanities Tag 2014 – Programm {{!}}|periodical=|publisher=Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz|url=https://www.digitale-bibliotheksdienste.uni-mainz.de/kurse-und-veranstaltungen/digital-humanities-tag-2014-methoden-technologien-horizonte-impulse-aus-der-praxis/programm/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-01-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where first drafts were made for the continuation of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mainz.de/studium-und-lehre/Dateien/JGU_LuST_05.pdf Magazin zu Lehre und Studium Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz], S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mainzed jahresbericht 2015/2016 |periodical= |publisher= |url=http://mainzed.org/jahresbericht/2015/ |deadurl= |format= |accessdate=2018-01-11 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |last= |date= |year= |month= |day= |language=German |pages= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monoculturalism''' is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/monoculturalism Monoculturalism], online Oxford dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Y. Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it may also involve the process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of [[cultural diversity]], is the opposite of [[multiculturalism]].
 
Rather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country's national culture via the exclusion of external influences. [[Japan]], [[China]], [[South Korea]], and [[North Korea]] are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. For instance, some European countries such as [[Finland]] are still effectively monocultural because of the people's shared culture and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|reason=There's no citation marked for this claim.|date=October 2017}}

== Ethnocentric monoculturalism ==
The idea of monoculturalism can be expanded to that of [[ethnocentrism]]. Ethnocentrism being the idea that one's ethnic background is superior to that of others. A feeling of superiority is one that can project mono-cultural ideals in an attempt to justify intrinsic ways of thinking. In nations with a majority of the population being native, ethnocentrism is blindly put upon those of other cultural backings. The idea of ethnocentrism being combined with monoculturalism yields many examples from history. Most obvious is the Holocaust, but further from that is any instance of genocide or simple racism. In defining genocide you can find the correlation it has with monoculturalism, and how it can be a resultant of mono-cultural, as well as, ethnocentric thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sue|first=Derald Wing|title=Whiteness and Ethnocentric Monoculturalism: Making the "Invisible" Visible|journal=American Psychologist|volume=November 2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instances ==

=== In genocide ===

In many of the [[genocide]]s practiced throughout history, some of them were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutu's and Tutsi's from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kenneth R. "Scourge of Racism: Genocide in Rwanda". ''Journal of Black Studies''. Vol. 39, No. 3 (Jan., 2009), pp. 471-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar example to that of the Rwandan Genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from England, in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn't involve many of Burma's Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them.&lt;ref&gt;"Tracking Genocide: Persecution of the Karen in Burma". ''Texas international law journal''. Volume: 48 Issue: 1 Page: 63 10/01/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the [[Karen people|Karen]], have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar [[world view]]s, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale.&lt;ref&gt;Marsella, Anthony (2005). [http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MarsellaHegemonicGlobalizationAustralianMosaic.pdf ""Hegemonic" Globalization and Cultural Diversity: The Risks of Global Monoculturalism"] (PDF). ''Australian Mosaic''. Issue 11 Number 13: 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.

== What ''type'' of thing is literature? ==
Literature can be described as all of the following:

* [[Communication]] &amp;ndash; activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
** [[Written communication]] (writing) &amp;ndash; representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Daniels, "The Study of Writing Systems", in ''The World's Writing Systems'', ed. Bright and Daniels, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subdivision of [[culture]] &amp;ndash; shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-arts the arts].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the humanities:

'''[[Humanities]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[speculative philosophy|speculative]], as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[Science|natural sciences]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What types of thing are the humanities? ==

The humanities can be described as all of the following:
* a branch of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is a field of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* study of the [[human condition]] &amp;ndash; unique and inescapable features of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.
** [[Theatre]] ([[Outline of theatre|outline]]) &amp;ndash; collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place.
** [[Music]] ([[Outline of music|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form the medium of which is sound and silence.
** [[Opera]] ([[List of opera topics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Stagecraft]] ([[Outline of stagecraft|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).
* [[Linguistics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of linguistics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of natural languages.
* [[Psychology]] &amp;nbsp; research of psychological pathology and therapeutic treatments separate from, but complementary to, [[Psychiatry|psychiatric medicine]]

* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.

'''Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art''' has become a lot more diverse as women artists start to rise in China. Many contemporary Chinese women artists have employed the use of female bodies as the subject of their artworks. From the ancient and imperial period of China until early the 19th century, women's body images in Chinese art were predominantly portrayed through male artists' lenses. As a result, female bodies were often misrepresented. With the arrival of [[modernism]] in Chinese contemporary art, women now have more influences in the field of [[visual arts]]. Chinese women artists employ unconventional artistic expressions in order to speak about their experiences of being a female and an artist in a patriarchal society. Although the Chinese visual art field has been more inclusive in the recent decades, women artists’ representation in major art [[exhibition]]s is still significantly less than male artists. Therefore, artists and curators have made a joint effort to devote certain art exhibitions to just Chinese women artists.

== Historical Context ==
=== Ancient and Imperial Period ===
[[File:Chinese - Landscape with Figures - Walters 35101O.jpg|thumb]]
Traditionally, female bodies were only valued as carriers for the family bloodline. In traditional paintings, nude women were a taboo for the artists. As a result, the portrayal of women's bodies was formulaic, always with slim figures, usually leaning on another object or have a slightly bent posture to further emphasize their delicate bodies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary|first=Fong|date=Summer 1996|title=Images of Women in Traditional Chinese Painting|jstor=1358525|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=17|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female images would also demonstrate ideal qualities of women at that time. Aside from feminine beauty and charm, she should also possess the virtues of subordinating herself in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Nigris|first=Ornella|date=March 2016|title=Traditional imagery of women as seen through female visual art: Hung Liu|url=|journal=International Communication of Chinese Culture|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women in these ancient paintings all wore long silk skirts that came down to the ankles. They could only show the part of their body above their chest. Their appearance, combined with their slender body figures, showed the submissive and demure qualities, which was desirable for male audiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1970s-1980s ===
A drastic change in ideal femininity occurred in 1966 and 1967 when the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Modern China|last=Andres|first=Julia|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520238145|location=|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural Revolution, led by [[Mao Zedong]], denounced the traditional image of women's inferiority and calls for a women's liberation in the new China. Propaganda tools, such as performance art, films, and posters, strongly supported this movement and effectively constructed and broadcast a new female identity. Feminine beauty was no longer characterized by delicate figures, but instead by masculinized images of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhuying|date=2015|title=Female Masculinity and the Image of Women in the Chinese Cultural Revolution|url=|journal=The International Academic Forum|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Iron girls" represented the permissible appearances of women in the 1970s. They should not wear anything that showed their female curves. Moreover, women were encouraged to dress like men and go to work like men did, given that Mao called for a "gender erasure" in order to make "Chinese women in new China."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pei|first=Yuxin|date=2006|title=Iron Girls, Strong Women, Beautiful Women Writers and Super Girls: A Discourse Analysis of the Gender Performance of Women in Contemporary China|url=|journal=Lilith: A Feminist History Journal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to "Iron Girls," "Strong Women" images were popularized through mass media, such as [[cartoon]]s and local newspapers. Their appearance was defined by masculinized traits: tanned skin tone, sturdy figures, and blue and black work uniforms. Feminine features, like smooth skin and hands, were seen as something to be ashamed of because they were expected to be contributing to the nation's economy like men did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Contemporary Portrayal of Women Bodies ==

=== Installation ===

==== "Trauma" ====
In her installation series, "Trauma", [[Hung Liu]] portrays a bound-foot woman. [[Foot binding]] was practiced among Chinese women from the Song dynasty up until the early 20th century. Women would wrap their feet tightly in order to keep them small, which was characterized as a feminine beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body|last=Pitts-Taylor|first=Victoria|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780313341458|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Liu's installation pieces, she repeatedly shows an emotionless woman with her naked feet. As a result of the foot binding cultural, these women had deformed feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Elaine H.|date=|title="Bad Women": Asian American Visual Artists Hanh Thi Pham, Hung Liu, and Yong Soon Min|jstor=3178131|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=22|pages=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paintings ===

==== Feng Jiali's Oil Paintings ====
Feng Jiali is famous for her [[oil painting]] of explicit images of [[female]] bodies. A series of her paintings depict young, school-aged [[Chinese people|Chinese]] girls, usually skimpily dressed in the bath or laying in bed. The girls in her paintings almost always look directly at the viewers, some innocent-looking, some with a confrontational gaze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwee Leng Teo|first=Phyllis|date=January 2010|title=Alternative Agency in Representation by Contemporary Chinese Women Artists|url=|journal=Asian Culture and History|volume=2|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another series of her works involves photographs of her [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] body. By revealing her own pregnant body fearlessly in front of the camera, she challenges the traditional views of pregnant body as something private and a mean to continue the family line, favoring boys over girls, and following the [[one-child policy]]. Because pregnant [[Nude (art)|nude]] is normally not defined as the ideal beauty found in female bodies, Feng’s photo collage expresses another aspect of being a woman. She desired to express the hardships and anxieties of being pregnant, which contradicts with the conventional, sacred portrayal of childbirth by many male artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853244969|title=New modern Chinese women and gender politics : the centennial of the end of the Qing Dynasty|last=Chen|first=Ya-chen|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2014|isbn=9780415841382|location=New York|pages=115|oclc=853244969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Banana Leaves Series" ====
Cai Jin, another contemporary oil painter, also challenges the traditional taboos of nudity in ancient Chinese art history. Unlike Feng Jiali, however, Cai articulates female bodies in a semi-abstract way by using organic elements in her paintings. A series of her paintings depict women's bodies shaped like banana tree leaves. Unlike many conventional portrayals of the female body that serves in the interest of male audiences, Cai painted the bodies like decomposed flesh, which is then metamorphosed into dripping, red, [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditionally, plants, especially flowers, are associated with femininity. However, Cai made a modern twist on this subject and made it into a somewhat unpleasant-looking and distorted image, rejecting the stereotypical delicate women and flowers association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like how Feng declared that pregnant bodies can be art too, Cai had made an assertion that although women's bodies aren't always going to be maintained in a perfect way, they can still become a form of art.

=== Performance Arts ===

==== "Opening of the Great Wall" ====

In ''Opening of the Great Wall'', He Chengyao presented her own naked body in a public space in 2001 and took a series of photographs of herself. The photographs documented her walking confidently with her upper body being nude. She held her bright red bra on her right hand and tied her sweater around the waist. She had a deadpan expression on her face and a confident posture as she walks toward the camera. The photo was taken on the [[Great Wall of China]], which is one of the most popular scenic spots in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Difference : Chinese Contemporary Art in the Global Context|last=Birgit|first=Hopfener|publisher=Verlag und Datenbank fur Geisteswissenschaften|year=2012|isbn=9783897397170|location=Weimar, Germany|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Your Body" by Xiang Jing at The Saatchi Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Your Body'' (2005, fiberglass &amp; paint, 270×160×150cm) at The Saatchi Gallery, The Revolution Continues: New Art from China, 2008]]
Despite the fact that she was surrounded by many curious tourists, He still maintained a confident look. She had also spontaneously joined in an [[Installation art|installation]] by a male artist, [[HA Schult|H.A. Schult]], which was exhibited on the Great Wall at the same time. Whether intended or not, she had made her appearance as a Chinese women artist in the mainstream of male art production. Furthermore, although her piece took place in 2001, women's nudity in public spaces was still considered taboo at the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czechónska|first=Magdalena|date=2012|title=Body Linguistic Visibility and Retrieved Bodies of the 20th and 21st Century in Chinese Women's Literature and Art|url=|journal=The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=25|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Broadcast Exercise" ====

He Chengyao completed this [[performance art]] piece in 2004 at the Shanghai Doland Museum of Modern Art, which combined the themes of body and identity. As the title of the piece suggested, He Chengyao performed a series of exercises in front of a large group of audiences, while her naked body was tightly wrapped with tape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her movement caused the tape to be ripped apart one by one. She also wrapped her self with the sticky side of the tape out, which made her body parts stuck together and making it increasingly harder to perform the exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sculpture ===

==== "Your Body" ====
[[Xiang Jing (artist)|Xiang Jing]] is a Beijing-based sculptor. She is best known for her depiction of realistic nude women sculptures. One of her sculptures, "Your Body", portrays a nude and bald woman slumping in a chair with her legs spread open. There's a prominent scar on the right side of her abdomen. She has sagging breasts, belly fat rolls, and blank expression on her face. None of these qualities fall under the expectation of the ideal female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xhingyu|date=October 2009|title=Xiang Jing: Shanghai Art Museum|url=|journal=Sculpture|volume=28|pages=78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of Contemporary Women Artists in Exhibitions ==
Though efforts have been made in order to make the visual art field more inclusive, women's artworks have still been underrepresented in major [[exhibition]]s. In the late 1980s, when the first major Chinese Art exhibition took place, only five women, out of sixty-seven artists and participants, were included in the show. While artists from mainland China, [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]], were being recognized for their diverse identities, women artists' participation in this first Chinese exhibition were not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, in the traveling exhibition, ''Transience: Chinese Experimental Art at the End of Twentieth Century'' in 1998, only three women artists presented their artworks. The curator of this exhibition, Wu Hung, intended to provide a platform for experimental Chinese art to take place. However, it appears that women's innovative artistic expressions were still being excluded and didn't gain as many recognition as male Chinese artists have had.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The issue of unequal representation among male and female Chinese artists did receive some attention from the public. As a result, curators and artists have made a joint effort to devote certain exhibition and publications solely for female artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Century Women'', National Gallery of China, Beijing (1998) ===

''Century Women'' was one of the first exhibitions dedicated to Chinese women artists. It intended to raise awareness on female experiences, roles, subject matters, and most importantly, art practices through the perspective of women living in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to providing a platform to showcase artworks made by Chinese women, it also exhibited photos and documents showing women's art production in China. More than seventy artists participated in this exhibition and presented over five hundred pieces of artworks&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''Her Presence in Colors VIII: International Women Artists Exhibition,'' National Gallery of China, Beijing (2008) ===

This exhibition was held concurrently around the world, such as China, [[Singapore]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]], to spread pan-Asian feminist artworks. Specifically, the show in [[New York City|New York]], ''Against the Tide (1998),'' featured five female artists who were born in China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Cai Jin, who also participated in this show, presented her Banana Plant series in the show, which is a suggestive form of presenting female nude bodies in a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/arts/art-in-review-534161.html|title=Art in Review|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">'''Puppy pregnancy syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] illness in humans brought on by [[mass hysteria]].

The syndrome is thought to be localized to villages in several states of [[India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], and [[Chhattisgarh]], and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Medicine challenges Indian superstition | newspaper = Deutsche Welle World | date = December 31, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|first=Shaikh Azizur |last=Rahman|url=http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

People suffering from this condition believe that shortly after being bitten by a dog, puppies are conceived within their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt; This is said to be especially likely if [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|the dog is sexually excited]] at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name="Scientific"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bering | first = Jesse | title = Puppy Pregnancy Syndrome: Men Who Think They Are Pregnant with Dogs | publisher = Scientific American | date = November 15, 2011  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/bering-in-mind/2011/11/15/puppy-pregnancy-syndrome-men-who-are-pregnant-with-dogs/ | accessdate = March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are said to bark like dogs, and have reported being able to see the puppies inside them when looking at water, or hear them growling in their abdomen.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;{{cite news | last = Achin | first = Kurt | title = Bizarre Medical Myth Persists In Rural India | newspaper =Voice of America | date = March 26, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/bizarre-medical-myth-persists-in-rural-india-143818636/179310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the victims will eventually die – especially men, who will give birth to their puppies through the penis.&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

[[Witch doctors]] offer oral cures, which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient".&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-[[rabies]] medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt; This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

Some psychiatrists believe that the syndrome meets the criteria for a [[Culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound disorder]].&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

In [[cultural anthropology]], '''reciprocity''' refers to the [[Non-market economics|non-market exchange]] of goods or labour ranging from direct [[barter]] (immediate exchange)  to forms of [[gift economy|gift exchange]] where a return is eventually expected (delayed exchange) as in the exchange of birthday gifts. It is thus distinct from the true gift, where no return is expected.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry|first=Jonathan|title=The Gift, the Indian Gift and the 'Indian Gift'|journal=Man|year=1986|volume=21|issue=3|pages=466–8|doi=10.2307/2803096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity is said to be the basis of most non-market exchange. David Graeber argues, "as currently used, 'reciprocity' can mean almost anything. It is very close to meaningless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the exchange is immediate, as in [[barter]], it does not create a social relationship. When the exchange is delayed, it creates both a relationship as well as an obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms of reciprocity can establish hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also have a political effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as in the [[Moka exchange|gift exchanges (Moka)]] between [[Big man (anthropology)|Big Men]] in Melanesia. Some forms of reciprocity are thus closely related to [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sahlins | first = Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Sahlins | title = Stone Age Economics | publisher = Aldine-Atherton | location = Chicago | year = 1972 | isbn = 0-202-01099-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall Sahlins]], a well-known American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity (generalized, balanced and negative) in the book ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972).&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt; Reciprocity was also the general principal used by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to explain the ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949), in one of the most influential works on kinship theory in the post-war period.

== The history of the "norm of reciprocity" in European economic thought ==

Annette Weiner argued that the "[[norm of reciprocity]]" is deeply implicated in the development of Western economic theory. Both [[John Locke]] and [[Adam Smith]] used the idea of reciprocity to justify a free market without state intervention. Reciprocity was used, on the one hand, to legitimize the idea of a self-regulating market; and to argue how individual vice was transformed into social good on the other. Western economic theorists starting with the eighteenth century Scots economists Sir James Steuart and Smith differentiated pre-modern natural (or self-subsistent) economies from civilized economies marked by a division of labour that necessitated exchange. Like early sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], they viewed natural economies as characterized by [[mechanical solidarity]] (like so many peas in a pod) whereas the civilized division of labour made producers mutually dependent upon one another resulting in [[organic solidarity]]. These oppositions solidified by the late nineteenth century in the evolutionary idea of primitive communism marked by mechanical solidarity as the antithesis and alter ego of Western "''[[Homo economicus]]''". It is this armchair anthropology opposition that originally informed modern anthropological debate when Malinowski sought to overturn the opposition and argue that archaic societies are equally regulated by the norm of reciprocity and maximizing behaviour.&lt;ref name=Weiner&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Annette|title=Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–33}}

The concept was key to the debate between early anthropologists [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] and [[Marcel Mauss]] on the meaning of "[[Kula ring|Kula exchange]]" in the [[Trobriand Islands]] off Papua New Guinea during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malinowski|first=Bronislaw|title=Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagos of Melanesian New Guinea|year=1922|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malinowski used Kula exchange to demonstrate the apparently random gift-giving was in fact a key political process by which non-state political leadership spanning a vast archipelago was established. Gift-giving, he argued, was not altruistic (as it supposedly is in our society) but politically motivated for individual gain. Marcel Mauss theorized the impetus for a return as "the spirit of the gift," an idea that has provoked a long debate in [[economic anthropology]] on what motivated the reciprocal exchange.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt; Claude Lévi-Strauss, drawing on Mauss, argued there were three spheres of exchange governed by reciprocity: language (exchange of words), kinship (exchange of women), and economics (exchange of things). He thus claimed all human relationships are based on the norm of reciprocity.&lt;ref name="Graeber 2011 91"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been disputed by anthropologists Jonathan Parry,&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt; [[Inalienable possessions|Annette Weiner]],&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; and [[David Graeber]]&lt;ref name="Graeber 2011 91"/&gt; amongst others.

== Basic types ==

===The domestic mode of production===
Marshall Sahlins has emphasized that non-market exchange is constrained by social relationships. That is, exchange in non-market societies is less about acquiring the [[means of production]] (whether land or tools) and more about the [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] of finished goods throughout a community. These social relationships are largely [[kinship]] based. His discussion of types of reciprocity is located within what he calls the "domestic mode of production." His typology of reciprocity thus refers to "cultures lacking a political state, and it applies only insofar as economy and social relations have not been modified by the historic penetration of states."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|186–8}} Paul Sillitoe has extended the analysis of reciprocity in these conditions, arguing that the type of reciprocity found will depend upon which sphere of production is being examined. The production of subsistence goods is under the control of domestic units and hence marked by generalized reciprocity. Wealth objects – by their nature from outside – are competitively exchanged to acquire status, but no one is able to control their production and hence centralize power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sillitoe|first=Paul|title=Why Spheres of exchange|journal=Ethnology|year=2006|volume=45|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.2307/4617561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sahlins' typology====

In these circumstances, reciprocal exchange can be divided in two types: dyadic back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling ([[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]]). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a ''within'' group relationship, whereas reciprocity is a ''between'' relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|188}} While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, it is also the basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.

Reciprocity, in contrast, is a dyadic exchange covering a range of possibilities, depending on individual interests. These interests will vary according to the social distance of the parties.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|191}} A range of kinds of reciprocity can thus be sketched out, according to Sahlins:

* ''Generalized reciprocity'' refers to putatively altruistic transactions, the "true gift" marked by "weak reciprocity" due to the vagueness of the obligation to reciprocate. The material side of the transaction (the exchange of equally valuable goods) is repressed by the social side and the reckoning of debts is avoided. The time for the return gift is indefinite and not qualified in quantity or quality. A failure to reciprocate does not result in the giver ceasing to give.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|193–4}}
* ''Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity'' refers to direct exchange of customary equivalents without any delay, and hence includes some forms of 'gift-exchange,' as well as purchases with 'primitive money.'  The exchange is less social, and is dominated by the material exchange and individual interests.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|194–5}}
* ''Negative reciprocity'' is the attempt to get "something for nothing with impunity." It may be described as 'haggling,' 'barter,' or 'theft.' It is the most impersonal form of exchange, with interested parties seeking to maximize their gains.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|195}}

====Reciprocity and kinship distance====

This typology of reciprocal exchange was developed by Sahlins in relation to the domestic mode of production (i.e. 'stone age economics') and hence should be contrasted with the 19th century armchair conceptions of 'primitive communism.' Within this same domestic mode of production, the degree of social distance – kinship in particular – affects the kind of reciprocity. Since kinship is the major way in which these societies are organized, nonkin (strangers) are viewed negatively. A general model of reciprocity must recognize that the closeness of the kin tie will vary according to the type of [[kinship]] system. In so far as kinship also determines residence, kinship closeness may also translate into spatial closeness. Hence one finds generalized reciprocity within the household-kinship group, balanced reciprocity within a spatial community, and negative reciprocity with outsiders (i.e. outside the community). The kind of reciprocity reflects the moral nature of the social relationship, hence morality is not universal, but dependent on social distance. Sahlins' model thus views reciprocity as socially, morally and economically structured and "the structure is that of kinship-tribal groups" not a universalizing moral ethic.&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|196–201}}

==== Reciprocity and kinship rank ====
With rank comes privileges. However, in traditional societies "social inequality is more the organization of economic equality. Often, in fact, high rank is only secured or sustained by o'ercrowing generosity."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|205}} Rank is usually generational, with elders having seniority, but still held by the bounds of close kinship. Generalized reciprocity by such elders may be a "starting mechanism" for more general hierarchy, by placing many in the giver's debt. This leads to the question, "when does reciprocity give way to redistribution."&lt;ref name="Sahlins 1972"/&gt;{{rp|209}} Sahlins argues that chiefly redistribution is not different in principle and nothing but a highly organized form of kinship-rank reciprocity.

===Reciprocity in market-based societies===

David Graeber argues, in contrast, that balanced gift exchange and market exchange have more in common than normally assumed. Since both are balanced, the social relationship created through the sense of debt and obligation is constantly in danger of being ended by the return gift/exchange. He thinks it better to contrast

* "''open''" and "''closed''" reciprocity. Open reciprocity "keeps no accounts because it implies a relation of permanent mutual commitment." This open reciprocity is closed off precisely when it is balanced. Thought of in this way, we can see the relationship as a matter of degree, more or less open or closed. Closed reciprocity of gifts is most like market exchange. It is competitive, individualistic and may border on barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=219–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reciprocity and marital alliance ==
{{main|Alliance theory}}

The '''alliance theory''' (or '''general theory of exchanges''') is the name given to the [[structuralism|structural]] method of studying [[kinship]] relations. It finds its origins in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'' (1949). According to Levi-Strauss, the [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards [[exogamy]] where certain categories of kin are forbidden to marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside of their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. In a process akin to the division of labour which makes exchange necessary, one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, and starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the negative prescriptions of the prohibition have positive counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], ''Les structures élémentaires de la parenté'', Paris, Mouton, 1967, 2ème édition, p.60''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds [[affinity (law)|affinity]], just as economic exchange due to the division of labour resulted in [[organic solidarity]]. This global phenomena takes the form of a "circulation of women" which links together the various social groups in one whole: society. Lévi-Strauss emphasizes this a system of generalized exchange based on indirect reciprocity. A generalized system does not involve a direct or balanced dyadic exchange and hence presupposes an expansion of trust.&lt;ref name="Parry 1986 467"/&gt;

In analysis of works of fiction, '''revisionism''' denotes the retelling of a conventional or established narrative with significant variations which deliberately "revise" the view shown in the original work.  For example, the film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' may be regarded as a revisionist [[Western (genre)|western]] because it portrays [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] sympathetically instead of as the [[Barbarian|savages]] of traditional westerns. 
Many original works of [[fantasy]] appear to retell [[fairy tale]]s in a revisionist manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Revisionist Fantasy", p. 810. {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of "Arthurian literature" includes innumerable variations from themes of the classic tales of [[King Arthur]]. It is debatable whether any particular examples set out to create a revised view.

Gervais worked initially in the music industry, attempting a career as a pop star in the 1980s as the singer of the [[new wave music|new wave]] act [[Seona Dancing]] and working as the manager of the then-unknown band [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before turning to comedy. Gervais appeared on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' on Channel 4 between 1998 and 2000. In 2000, he was given a [[Channel 4]] talk show, ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]'', and then achieved greater mainstream fame a year later with his BBC television series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. It was followed by ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' in 2005. He co-wrote and co-directed both series with [[Stephen Merchant]]. In addition to writing and directing the shows, he played the lead roles of [[David Brent]] in ''The Office'' and [[Andy Millman]] in ''Extras''. He reprised his role as Brent in the comedy film ''[[Life on the Road]]''. 

Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s. He has performed five multi-national stand-up comedy tours, and wrote the ''[[Flanimals]]'' book series. Gervais, Merchant and [[Karl Pilkington]] created the [[podcast]], ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'', which has spawned various spin-offs starring Pilkington and produced by Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1703591,00.html|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=John|last=Plunkett|date=6 February 2006|accessdate=27 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Music===
In 1983, during his final year as a student at UCL (University College London), Gervais and college friend [[Bill Macrae]] formed the [[New wave music|new wave]] pop [[Musical ensemble|duo]], [[Seona Dancing]]. They were signed by [[London Records]], which released two of their singles—"[[More to Lose]]" and "[[Bitter Heart (song)|Bitter Heart]]". The songs failed to chart inside the UK top 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being successful in the UK, Seona Dancing did manage to score a hit in the [[Philippines]] with "More to Lose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/26/ricky_gervais_pop_band/|title=Ricky Gervais' career as an 80's glam-pop star|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as the manager for [[Suede (band)|Suede]] before they became successful in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a321491/brett-anderson-praises-ex-manager-ricky-gervais.html#~p2t6TtO7XcwBvE|title=Brent Anderson Praises Ex-manager Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais performed a live tour as [[David Brent]] along with a band under the name "Foregone Conclusion". Gervais and the band performed songs written under the Brent character including songs such as "Equality Street" and "[[Free Love Freeway]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/73215 |title=Ricky Gervais plays debut David Brent show with former Razorlight star in London |work=[[NME]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais also produced a series of YouTube videos under the title 'Learn Guitar with David Brent', featuring acoustic guitar versions of nine songs.

In 2016, as part of the ''Life on Road'' film promotion, Gervais published the ''David Brent Songbook'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01HBPUIC6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 |title=David Brent Songbook eBook: David Brent: Amazon.co.uk: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing 15 songs. These were also recorded for the album ''Life on the Road'', under the name of David Brent and Foregone Conclusion.

===Radio===
Gervais worked as an [[event management|assistant events manager]] for the [[University of London Union]] (ULU), then moved from ULU to a job as head of speech at the alternative radio station [[XFM|Xfm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/comedy/2010/12/ricky-gervais-ince-office|title=Ricky Gervais: They Call Me Entertainment|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needing an assistant, Gervais interviewed the first person whose ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' he saw. It belonged to [[Stephen Merchant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/arts/television/14gervais.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Three Mates Laughing (Well, Two Are) |work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2015|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 Gervais was made [[Layoff|redundant]] when the station was taken over by the [[Capital Radio]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|title=XFM &amp; The Podfather: Ricky Gervais Week|work=City of Film|first=Graham|last=McMorrow|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121193147/http://www.cityoffilms.com/reel-news/the-podfather-ricky-gervais/|archivedate=21 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he was also a regular contributor to [[Mary Anne Hobbs]]' Radio 1 show, performing vox pop interviews in unlikely locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Worthington |first=Tim |date=2012 |title=Fun At One: The Story Of Comedy At BBC Radio 1 |url= |location= |publisher=Lulu Press |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first series of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', Gervais and Merchant returned to [[Xfm]] in November 2001 for a Saturday radio show. This was when the pair first worked with [[Karl Pilkington]], who produced the shows and later collaborated with them on their series of [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/5930/ricky-gervais-and-stephen-merchant-return-to-xfm|title=Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Return to Xfm|work=Gigwise |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Gervais began hosting the weekly radio show ''Ricky Gervais Is Deadly Sirius'' on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Ricky Gervais on New SiriusXM Talk Show: They ‘Made Me an Offer I Couldn’t Refuse’|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/ricky-gervais-siriusxm-comedy-talk-show-1202593641/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=21 October 2017|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Podcast====
{{See also|The Ricky Gervais Show|List of The Ricky Gervais Show episodes}}
On 5 December 2005, ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'' began offering free weekly [[podcast]]s, including ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' featuring Gervais, Merchant, and [[Karl Pilkington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4479230.stm|title=Gervais radio show to be podcast |date= 28 November 2005|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout January and February 2006 the podcast was consistently ranked the number-one podcast in the world; it appeared in the 2007 [[Guinness World Record]] for the world's most-downloaded podcast, having gained an average of 261,670 downloads per episode during its first month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/06/radio.newmedia|title=Gervais podcast in the record books|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more series—each with six podcasts—were released between February and September 2006.

In late 2006, three more free podcasts were released. Together called "The Podfather Trilogy", they debuted individually at Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Podfather-Trilogy-Season-Gervais/dp/B002SPXUZC|title=The Podfather Trilogy|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three were known by Ricky and Steve as "The Fourth Season". In October 2007 another free full-length podcast was released through iTunes; this podcast was originally given out for free during a performance of Gervais' ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'' stand-up tour in London. On 25 November 2007 Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released another free full-length podcast, which lasted just over an hour.

In August 2008, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded their fifth season of [[audiobook]]s, totaling 4 chapters, which were released on 16 September 2008. These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 "Guides" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law &amp; Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.

===Television===

====Early television appearances====

Gervais has contributed to the [[BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavare]] Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais

====''The Office''====
{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}
''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from [[Ash Atalla]], who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss'. Thus [[David Brent]] was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment [[Paul Jackson (producer)|Paul Jackson]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], who then passed it on to Head of Comedy [[Jon Plowman]], who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais
|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six-episode series of ''The Office'' aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ph/entertainment/people/ricky-gervais/AA3l0x9|title=Ricky Gervais| publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word-of-mouth, repeats, and DVDs helped spread the word, building up momentum and anticipation for the second series, also comprising six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html|title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success of ''The Office''{{'s}} second series, Gervais was named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful person in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|title=Gervais crowned 'king of comedy'|date=6 January 2003|publisher=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRevTA3J?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2631307.stm|archivedate=13 September 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''The Office'' won the [[Golden Globe]]s for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for Gervais, who said in a 2015 BBC interview that the award was the gateway to America for him.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Husam sam Asi|title=What does Ricky Gervais really think of the Golden Globes? - Interview|date=16 January 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbPlRseDPU|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Office]]'' brand has since been remade for audiences in [[:sv:Kontoret|Sweden]], [[Le Bureau|France]], [[Stromberg (TV series)|Germany]], [[La Job|Quebec]], [[Os Aspones|Brazil]] and the [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|publisher=Splitsider.com|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Merchant are producers of the American version, and they also co-wrote the episode "[[The Convict]]" for the show's third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4687784.stm|title=Gervais writing US Office episode|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais has said that the episode "[[Episode Four (The Office, Series One)|Training]]" is his favourite, where Brent plays his guitar and sings.

====''Extras''====
{{Main|Extras (TV series)}}
[[Extras (TV series)|''Extras'']] had its debut on the BBC on 21 July 2005; directed by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the sitcom ran for twelve episodes and starred Gervais as Andy Millman, a [[Extra (actor)|background artist]]. Millman is more self-aware and intentionally humorous than Gervais' ''The Office'' character David Brent. Guest stars on the first series of ''Extras'' include [[Ross Kemp]], [[Les Dennis]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Francesca Martinez]]. A second series began on 14 September 2006 in the UK and featured appearances by [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Diana Rigg|Dame Diana Rigg]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Keith Chegwin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Ronnie Corbett]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Patricia Potter]], [[Sophia Myles]], [[Moira Stuart]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/28/lastnightstvextras |title=Extras attacked celebrity - with a little help from George Michael, David Tennant et al|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JonathanRossRickyGervais.jpg|thumb|Gervais (right) with [[Jonathan Ross]] at [[Live 8]] in July 2005]]
A Christmas special of ''Extras'' aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by [[George Michael]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], Jonathan Ross and [[David Tennant]].

Gervais was influenced by ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', in making ''Extras'', particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936|title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever |work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Gervais won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] for his portrayal of Andy Millman in the second series of ''Extras''. As Gervais was not present at the awards ceremony, the trophy was accepted on his behalf by [[Steve Carell]], the actor who starred as regional manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] – the counterpart to Gervais' David Brent – on [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation of ''The Office'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/lat-accep-carel_johsi3nc20090817152500-photo.html |title=Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell accept Ricky Gervais' Emmy |publisher=LA Times |date=5 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with ''Extras'', "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of ''The Office'', but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry ([[Shaun Williamson]]) and Darren ([[Stephen Merchant]]), and the apparent parody of this style with ''When The Whistle Blows'', and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely [[stereotype]]d gay couple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky|title=Extras work needed, Ricky?|first=Chris |last=Tryhorn|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Ricky Gervais Show (animated series)|The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' is an animated TV show that debuted on US cable network [[HBO]] on 19 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/gervais-series-hbo-1013291/|title=Ricky Gervais Gets Animated for New HBO Series|last=Stanhope|first=Kate |date=22 December 2009|work=[[TV Guide]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026214901/http://www.tvguide.com/news/gervais-series-hbo-1013291/ | archivedate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/tca-press-tour.html|title=TCA press tour: Ricky Gervais finds comedy gold in a round-headed minion|last=Press|first=Joy |date=14 January 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the first series began airing on 23 April 2010 on [[Channel 4]]. The show was developed using original podcast recordings from ''[[The Ricky Gervais Show]]'' starring Gervais, [[Stephen Merchant]], and [[Karl Pilkington]]. After receiving a loyal and enthusiastic following in the US, cable channel [[HBO]] recommissioned the show for a second series, which aired in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/24/ricky-gervais-show-hbo | title=Ricky Gervais Show gets second HBO series | date=24 March 2010 |work=The Guardian | location=London | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a third series which started airing in April 2012.

{{Main|Life's Too Short (TV series)}}

''[[Life's Too Short (TV series)|Life's Too Short]]'' began airing on [[BBC Two]] on 10 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sykes|first=Jaine|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/06/lifes-too-short-1.shtml|title=Life's Too Short |publisher=BBC Blog|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2TtqePh3xw|title=Tweet That! – Life's Too Short|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=17 October 2011|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais and Stephen Merchant would write this [[observational comedy|observational]] sitcom from an idea by [[Warwick Davis]]. It is described by Gervais as being about "the life of a showbiz [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]" and as "a cross between ''Extras'' and ''The Office''". The show stars actor Davis playing a fictionalized version of himself, as well as Gervais and Merchant.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/24/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short|title=Ricky Gervais plans Life's Too Short film|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Ben|last=Child|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium cable channel [[HBO]], who co-produced the series with the BBC, had the US rights and began airing the series on 19 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Ricky-Gervais-Steven-Merchant-Warwick-Davis-Tease-Life-Too-Short-36112.html|title=Ricky Gervais, Steven Merchant, And Warwick Davis Tease Life's Too Short|publisher=Cinemablend.com|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a326379/ricky-gervais-lifes-too-short-heads-for-hbo.html |title=Ricky Gervais 'Life's Too Short' heads for HBO – US TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''An Idiot Abroad''====
{{Main|An Idiot Abroad}}
''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'' is a travel documentary produced by Gervais and Merchant where a reluctant Pilkington travels around the world, while his reactions to people and places is recorded. Occasionally, Gervais and Merchant call him to surprise him with a new place to visit or a task to do. Pilkington reports back to them and mostly complains about the situation he is in. Gervais said there is no planning, a camera crew follows his friend around recording many hours of film which Gervais edits down to about an hour each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11326209|title=Ricky Gervais says show with Karl Pilkington is real|publisher=BBC|accessdate =6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date two series and a Christmas special have aired, series one involves Pilkington visiting the Seven Wonders of the World, in the second show he chooses to complete tasks from a bucket list provided by Gervais and in the special Warwick Davis joins Pilkington on a journey following Marco Polo's route from Italy to China.

====''Derek''====
{{Main|Derek (TV series)}}
In November 2011, Gervais filmed in London a 35-minute pilot episode for a potential [[comedy-drama]] series called ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]'', which aired on [[Channel 4]] on 12 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plumplard.com |date=August 2004 |url=http://rickygervais.com/thissideofthetruthe.php |title=Ricky Gervais...

British comedian [[Kerry Godliman]] plays Derek's best friend Hannah and David Earl plays Kev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/derek/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 |title=Derek |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais said that the series is about "kindness [being] more important than anything else". He added "It's about the forgotten – everyone's forgotten. It's all these arbitrary people who didn't know each other, and they're in there now because they're in the last years of their life. And it's about the people who help them, who themselves are losers and have their own problems. It's about a bunch of people with nothing, but making the most of it, and they're together." He chose to set the sitcom in a retirement home after he watched ''[[Secret Millionaire]]'' – "It was always these people with huge problems who were helping other people. I thought about having Derek help old people because no one cares about old people in this country... I think it's perfect for now."&lt;ref name=independentderek&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Gerard|title='Mock the disabled?

===Stand-up comedy===
Gervais began his stand-up career in the late 1990s; his first successful show took place at the [[Cafe Royal]], as part of the [[2001 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Titled ''Rubbernecker'', the show also featured [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stephen Merchant]].

Gervais later toured the UK in 2003 with his stand-up show ''[[Animals (comedy)|Animals]]''. The ''[[Politics (comedy)|Politics]]'' tour followed a year later. Both of these shows were recorded for release on DVD and television broadcast. The third part of the themed live trilogy, ''[[Fame (comedy)|Fame]]'', took place in 2007. It started in [[Glasgow]] in January and ended in [[Sheffield]] in April. [[Blackpool]] reported selling out of tickets within 45 minutes of them going on sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/12/13/4816/what_a_sell-out|title=What a sell-out, Huge demand for Gervais tour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsnight Review]]'''s panel saw ''Animals'' during its [[UCL Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury]] run and covered it in January 2003. They were not favourable, with ''[[Private Eye]]'' editor [[Ian Hislop]] saying it was "cobbled together...banal...a bit flat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=BBC News, 13&amp;nbsp;January 2003 | date=13 January 2003 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Gervais closed each show by calling Hislop an "ugly little pug-faced cunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a179513/ten-things-you-never-knew-about-ricky-gervais.html|title=Ten Things You Never Knew About Ricky Gervais|publisher=Digital Spy|first=Alex |last=Fletcher|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/2654105.stm|title=Newsnight Review discussed Ricky Gervais one man show Animals at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fame'' was the subject of some controversy in January 2007 when Gervais told a story, ostensibly about how people will do anything to become famous, referring to [[Ipswich serial murders|the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gervais apologetic over 'killing' joke|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/gervais_apologetic_over_killing_joke_1_112739|website=Ipswich Star|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gervais announced that his next stand up show will be called ''Humanity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-01-17/ricky-gervais-returning-to-stand-up-comedy-i-think-it-will-be-my-angriest-yet|title=Ricky Gervais returning to stand-up comedy: "I think it will be my angriest yet"|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, he said he was too busy to do his tour due to producing two films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-08/ricky-gervais-why-my-humanity-live-stand-up-tour-is-on-hold-for-now|title=Ricky Gervais Why My Humanity Live Stand Uo Tour is On Hold for Now|work=Radio Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Gervais was back doing stand up in London, starting with some low key warm-ups with cast members from ''[[Derek (TV series)|Derek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-03-29/ricky-gervais-is-performing-stand-up-gigs-in-london-this-may|title=Ricky Gervais is performing stand up gigs in London this May|work=Radiotimes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "Finally, I'm going to do some stand-up. The first in about six years if you don't count hosting the [[Golden Globes]]."

He continued his ''Humanity'' show throughout 2017 and into 2018; appearing at [[SF Sketchfest]] as part of the tour, which devoted a night in honor of the comedian, alongside comedic legend and mentor [[Christopher Guest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricky Gervais to appear at SF Sketchfest before taking on ‘Humanity’|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/performance/article/Ricky-Gervais-to-appear-at-SF-Sketchfest-before-12473686.php|website=SF Chronicle|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next tour and [[Netflix]] special was announced in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2018/04/20/39738/ricky_gervais_announces_his_first_supernature_gigs|title=Ricky Gervais announces his first SuperNature gigs : News 2018 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|first=Powder Blue Internet Business|last=Solutions|website=www.chortle.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====
One of the first animations Gervais voiced was the character of Penguin in [[Robbie the Reindeer]]'s ''Legend of the Lost Tribe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/n2kph/robbie-the-reindeer-in-legend-of-the-lost-tribe|title=Robbie the Reindeer in Legend of the Lost Tribe|work=Radio Times|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gervais guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]". He is the only British comic to write and star in a ''Simpsons'' episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified the extent of his input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed and Confused]]'' magazine (January 2006): "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a ''Simpsons'' script. I'm going to get the credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort". Asked in a separate interview about how his idea for the episode (in which Homer swaps Marge on a game show) came about, Gervais replied: "I've always been fascinated with reality game shows but I think it was my girlfriend's idea. We watch ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' at the moment, we watch ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here...]]'' we watch all those reality TV shows&amp;nbsp;– ''The Office'' came out of those docu-soaps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukula.com/TorontoArticle.aspx?SectionID=3&amp;ObjectID=1665&amp;CityID=3|title= Interview at UKULA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gervais, a longstanding ''Simpsons'' fan, presented a segment to mark the show's 20th anniversary on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on 16 June 2007.

[[Louis C.K.]] had Gervais play Dr. Ben, his doctor on two episodes of his series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stateless society''' is a [[society]] that is not [[government|governed]] by a [[state (polity)|state]], or, especially in common [[American English]], has no government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; In stateless societies, there is little [[centralization|concentration]] of [[authority]]; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in [[political power|power]] and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Stephen |title= The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2219-0 |page= 198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLAWMGqKMb4C&amp;pg=PA198 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Béteille |first= André |authorlink= André Béteille |chapter= Inequality and Equality |editor-last= Ingold |editor-first= Tim |title= Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-415-28604-6 |pages= 1042–1043 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;pg=PA1042 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a [[sovereign state]]. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield [[failed state|little or no actual power]]. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been [[cultural assimilation|integrated into the state-based societies around them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faulks |first= Keith |title= Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2709-6 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fjCczhvWj0C&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political philosophies, particularly [[anarchism]], consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

==Prehistoric peoples==
In [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[history]], a stateless society denotes a less complex human [[community]] without a state, such as a [[tribe]], a [[clan]], a [[band society]] or a [[chiefdom]]. The main criterion of "complexity" used is the extent to which a [[division of labor]] has occurred such that many people are permanently ''specialized'' in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] and [[laws]]. An additional criterion is [[population size]]. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human [[prehistory]] the state did not exist.

{{Quotation|For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the Paleolithic [i.e. the stone age], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 BC it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three millennia the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157.|Robert L. Carneiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert L. |last= Carneiro |chapter= Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion |page= 219 |editor1-first= Ronald |editor1-last= Cohen |editor2-first= Elman R. |editor2-last= Service |title= Origins of the State: The Anthropology of Political Evolution |location= Philadelphia |publisher= Institute for the Study of Human Issues |year= 1978 |lastauthoramp= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced [[agriculture]]. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: [[Lawrence Krader]] for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krader |title= Formation of the State |location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher= Prentice-Hallm |year= 1968 |at= ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity [[per capita]] which at least makes possible a ''permanent'' [[surplus product]] (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Henri J.M. |editor1-last= Claessen |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Skalnik |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henri+J.M.+Claessen#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20J.M.%20Claessen&amp;f=false |title= The Early State |location= The Hague |publisher= Mouton |year= 1978 |via= Google Books|isbn= 9789027979049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]] has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized [[Harappan civilization]], which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the [[Indus]] region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Gregory L. |last= Possehl |chapter= Sociocultural Complexity Without the State: The Indus civilization |editor1-first= Gary M. |editor1-last= Feinman |editor2-first= Joyce |editor2-last= Marcus |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Archaic States |location= Santa Fe |publisher= School of American Research Press |year= 1998 |pages= 261–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the [[stone age]] which have been discovered, such as [[Çatal Höyük]] and [[Jericho]], no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Chris |editor-last= Scarre |title= The Human Past |edition= 2nd |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |year= 2009 |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first=  John F. |title= The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-520-24678-2 |pages= 4–5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA4 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncontacted peoples]] may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.

==As a political ideal==
Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.

A central tenet of [[anarchism]] is the advocacy of society without states.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2005 |page= 14 |quote= Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheehan |first= Sean |title= Anarchism |location= London |publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2004 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of society sought for varies significantly between [[anarchist schools of thought]], ranging from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;{{cite book |last= Slevin |first= Carl |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics |editor1-first= Iain |editor1-last= McLean |editor2-first= Alistair |editor2-last= McMillan |lastauthoramp= yes |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxism]], [[Marx's theory of the state]] considers that in a [[post-capitalist]] society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and [[Withering away of the state|wither away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm |first= Frederick |last= Engels |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |year= 1880 |chapter= Part III: Historical Materialism |quote= State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master—free. |via= Marx/Engels Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of [[stateless communism]], a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.

==Social and economic organization==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have found that [[social stratification]] is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowdy |first= John |year= 2006 |chapter= Hunter-Gatherers and the Mythology of the Market |editor1-link= Richard Borshay Lee |editor1-first= Richard B. |editor1-last= Lee |editor2-first= Richard H. |editor2-last= Daly |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers |page= 391 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-60919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize [[subsistence agriculture]] at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chase |first1= Diane Z. |last2= Chase |first2= Arlen F. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Mesoamerican Elites: An Archaeological Assessment |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-8061-3542-7 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwxl5jjQ-dUC&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleming, Thomas|title=The Politics of Human Nature|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-693-0|pages=165–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saK1sFtSXuEC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Steven Shaviro 05A.jpg|thumb|Steven Shaviro (2007)]]
'''Steven Shaviro''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|ɪr|oʊ}}; born April 3, 1954) is an American academic, [[philosopher]] and [[cultural critic]] whose areas of interest include [[film theory]], [[time]], [[science fiction]], [[panpsychism]], [[capitalism]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[subjectivity]]. He earned a PhD from Yale in 1981. 

==Work==
His most widely read book is ''Doom Patrols'', a "theoretical fiction" that outlines the state of [[postmodernism]] during the early 1990s, using poetic language, personal anecdotes, and creative prose. He has also written extensively about [[music videos]] as an artform.

Additionally, Shaviro has written a book about film theory, ''The Cinematic Body'', which examines the dominance of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in contemporary academic film theory. According to Shaviro, the use of [[psychoanalysis]] has mirrored the actions of a [[cult]], with its own religious texts (essays by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan).

Shaviro's book ''Connected, Or, What It Means to Live in the Network Society'', appeared in 2003. A later book, ''Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics'' was published in May 2009.

The '''Three Great Tenjin Shrines''' (日本三大天神) are a group of three [[Shinto]] shrines dedicated to [[Tenjin (kami)|Tenjin]], the deified form of the scholar-courtier [[Sugawara no Michizane]]. They are traditionally enumerated as:

*[[Dazaifu Tenman-gū]], [[Dazaifu, Fukuoka]] Prefecture
*[[Hōfu Tenman-gū]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]
*[[Kitano Tenman-gū]], [[Kyoto]]

The concept of the '''Three Kingdoms of Korea''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=삼국시대}}) refers to the three kingdoms of [[Baekje]] (백제), [[Silla]] (신라) and [[Goguryeo]] (고구려). [[Goguryeo]] was later known as Goryeo (고려), from which the modern name ''[[Korea]]'' is derived. The Three Kingdoms period was defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD (but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of Korean peninsula and relatively big states like [[Okjeo]], [[Buyeo]], and [[Dongye]] in its northern part and Manchuria).

The three kingdoms occupied the entire [[Korean Peninsula]] and most of [[Manchuria]], located in present-day [[China]] and [[Russia]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The kingdoms of Baekje and Silla dominated the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and [[Tamna]], whereas Goguryeo controlled the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Manchuria]] and the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths and originated from [[Buyeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The National Folk Museum of Korea (South Korea)|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature: Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture Vol. III|date=2014|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788928900848|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsR3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century, allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Silla]] unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history, forming a united Korean national identity for the first time. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the [[Tang dynasty]] established a short-lived [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East|military government]] to administer parts of the Korean peninsula. However, as a result of the [[Silla–Tang Wars]] (≈670–676), Silla forces expelled the Protectorate armies from the peninsula in 676. The following period is known as the Unified Silla or Later Silla (668–935).

Subsequently, [[Dae Joyeong]], a former Goguryeo general, founded [[Balhae]] in the former territory of Goguryeo after defeating the [[Tang dynasty]] at the [[Battle of Tianmenling]].

The predecessor period, before the development of the full-fledged kingdoms, is sometimes called [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms period]].

Main primary sources for this period include ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' and ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' in Korea, and the "Eastern Barbarians" section (東夷傳) from the ''Book of Wei'' (魏書) of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in China.

==Names==
Beginning in the 7th century, the name "[[Samhan]]" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The "Han" in the names of the [[Korean Empire]], ''Daehan Jeguk'', and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), ''Daehan Minguk'' or ''Hanguk'', are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이기환 |title=[이기환의 흔적의 역사]국호논쟁의 전말…대한민국이냐 고려공화국이냐 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&amp;code=960100&amp;www |website=경향신문 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun"&gt;{{cite web |last1=이덕일 |title=[이덕일 사랑] 대~한민국 |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=조선닷컴 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Samguk Sagi]] and [[Samguk Yusa]], [[Silla]] implemented a national policy, "Samhan Unification" ({{hangul|삼한일통}}), to integrate refugees and migrants from [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]]. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in [[Cheongju]] with an inscription: "The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded."&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; During the [[Later Silla]] period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, [[Choe Chiwon]] equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; By the [[Goryeo]] period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, [[Wang Geon]] declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt; Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the [[Joseon]] period and was widely referenced in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt;

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |title=고현묘지명(高玄墓誌銘) |url=http://gsm.nricp.go.kr/_third/user/frame.jsp?View=search&amp;No=4&amp;ksmno=7190 |website=한국금석문 종합영상정보시스템 |publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name="kwon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deok-young |first1=Kwon |title=An inquiry into the name of Three Kingdom(三國) inscribed on the epitaph of T’ang(唐) period |journal=The Journal of Korean Ancient History |date=2014 |volume=75 |pages=105–137 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02486618 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |issn=1226-6213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goguryeo was alternately called [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals "Mahan leaders" ({{Korean|마한추장|馬韓酋長|labels=no}}) in 645.&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; In 651, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan.&lt;ref name="kyunghyang" /&gt; Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea "Samhan", especially Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="kwon" /&gt; For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon ({{Korean|고현|高玄|labels=no}}), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a "Liaodong Samhan man" ({{Korean|요동 삼한인|遼東 三韓人|labels=no}}).&lt;ref name="National" /&gt; The [[History of Liao]] equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="chosun" /&gt;

The name "Three Kingdoms" was used in the titles of the Korean histories ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' (12th&amp;nbsp;century) and ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'' (13th&amp;nbsp;century), and should not be confused with the Chinese [[Three Kingdoms]].

==Background==
[[File:7th century painting of Koreans.png|thumb|left|7th century Tang dynasty painting of envoys from the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla]]
The Three Kingdoms was founded after the fall of [[Wiman Joseon]], and gradually conquered and absorbed various other small states and confederacies. After the fall of Gojoseon, the [[Han dynasty]] established four [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] in present
[[Liaoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/5880-2-5623.pdf |title=The Puyeo-Koguryeo Ye-maek the Sushen-Yilou Tungus, and the Xianbei Yan |author=Hong, Wontack |pages=1–7 |journal=East Asian History: A Korean Perspective |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three fell quickly to the [[Samhan]], and the last was destroyed by Goguryeo in 313.

The nascent precursors of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]] expanded within the web of statelets during the [[Proto Three Kingdoms]] Period, and [[Goguryeo]] conquered neighboring state like [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]] in [[Manchuria]] and chiefdoms in [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]] which occupied the northeastern Korean peninsula. The three polities made the transition from walled-town state to full-fledged state-level societies between 1st – 3rd century AD.

All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. Their original religions appear to have been [[shamanism|shamanistic]], but they were increasingly influenced by Chinese culture, particularly [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. In the 4th century, [[Buddhism]] was introduced to the peninsula and spread rapidly, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms.

==Goguryeo==

[[File:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Goguryeo tomb mural]]
[[Goguryeo]] emerged on the north and south banks of the [[Yalu River|Yalu (Amrok)]] River, in the wake of [[Gojoseon]]'s fall. The first mention of Goguryeo in Chinese records dates from 75 BC in reference to a commandery established by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]], although even earlier mentions of "Guri" (구리) may be of the same state. Evidence indicates Goguryeo was the most advanced, and likely the first established, of the three kingdoms.

Goguryeo, eventually the largest of the three kingdoms, had several capitals in alternation: two capitals in the upper Yalu area, and later Nangrang (''[[Lelang]]'' in Chinese) which is now part of [[Pyongyang]]. At the beginning, the state was located on the border with [[China]]; it gradually expanded into Manchuria and destroyed the Chinese [[Lelang commandery]] in 313. The cultural influence of the Chinese continued as Buddhism was adopted as the official religion in 372.

Goguryeo controlled not only Koreans but also Chinese and Tungusic tribes in Manchuria and [[North Korea]]. After the establishment of the [[Sui Dynasty]] and later the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China, the estate continued to aggress China and Korean Silla and Baekje until conquered by allied Silla–Tang forces in 668. Most of its territory was absorbed by Tang Dynasty China and the territory of former Baekje was absorbed by Korean Silla.

==Baekje==

Baekje absorbed or conquered other Mahan chiefdoms and, at its peak in the 4th century, controlled most of the western Korean peninsula. Buddhism was introduced to Baekje in 384 from Goguryeo, which Baekje welcomed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Baekje exerted its political influence on [[Tamna]], a kingdom that ruled [[Jejudo]]. Baekje maintained a close relationship with and extracted tribute from Tamna. Baekje's religious and artistic culture influenced [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]].

Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto and declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Chai-Shin|title=The New History of Korean Civilization|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462055593|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYKNdiDCGLAC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 5th century, under attack from Goguryeo, the capital of Baekje was moved south to Ungjin (present-day [[Gongju]]) and later further south to [[Sabi (Korea)|Sabi]] (present-day [[Buyeo County|Buyeo]]).

==Silla==
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], 7th century]]
{{main|Silla}}
According to Korean records, in 57 BC, Seorabeol (or Saro, later [[Silla]]) in the southeast of the peninsula unified and expanded the confederation of city-states known as [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]]. Although ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records that Silla was the earliest-founded of the three kingdoms, other written and archaeological records indicate that Silla was likely the last of the three to establish a centralized government.

Silla was the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Jinwung|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253000248|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Korea: Outline of a Civilisation|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004300057|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renamed from Saro to Silla in 503, the kingdom annexed the [[Gaya confederacy]] (which in turn had absorbed [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] earlier) in the first half of the 6th century. Goguryeo and Baekje responded by forming an alliance. To cope with invasions from Goguryeo and Baekje, Silla deepened its relations with the Tang Dynasty, with her newly gained access to the Yellow Sea making direct contact with the Tang possible. After the conquest of Goguryeo and Baekje with her Tang allies, the Silla kingdom drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula and occupied the lands south of Pyongyang.

The capital of Silla was Seorabeol (now [[Gyeongju]]; "Seorabeol", "서라벌", is hypothesized to have been the ancient Korean term for "capital"). [[Buddhism]] became the official religion in 528. The remaining material culture from the kingdom of Silla including unique gold metalwork shows influence from the northern nomadic steppes, differentiating it from the culture of Goguryeo and Baekje where Chinese influence was more pronounced.

==Other states==
Other smaller states or regions existed in Korea before and during this period:
*[[Gaya confederacy]], until annexed by Silla
*[[Dongye]], [[Okjeo]], and [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]], all three conquered by Goguryeo
*[[Usan-guk|Usan]] ([[Ulleung-do]]) tributary of Silla
*[[Tamna]] ([[Jeju-do]]) tributary of Baekje
[[File:Korea-Gaya Warrior.jpg|thumb|right|A Gaya soldier.]]

==Fate==
Allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], Silla conquered Goguryeo in 668, after having already conquered Gaya in 562 and Baekje in 660, thus ushering in the North-South states period with [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]] to the south and [[Balhae]] to the north, when [[Dae Jo-young]], a former Goguryeo military officer, revolted against Tang Chinese rule and began reconquering former Goguryeo territories.

==Archaeological perspectives==
[[File:Pressapochista15.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An unusual drinking vessel excavated from a Gaya mounded burial.]] 
Archaeologists use [[Archaeological theory|theoretical]] guidelines derived from [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], analogy, and [[ethnohistory]] to the concept of what defines a [[Sociocultural evolution|state-level society]]. This is different from the concept of state (''guk'' or [[Chinese language|Sino]] ko: 國, walled-town state, etc.) in the discipline of Korean History. In anthropological [[archaeology]] the presence of urban centres (especially capitals), monumental architecture, craft specialization and standardization of production, ostentatious burials, [[Writing system|writing or recording systems]], [[bureaucracy]], demonstrated political control of geographical areas that are usually larger in area than a single river valley, etc. make up some of these correlates that define states.&lt;ref name=Rhee&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rhee, S.N.  |author2=Choi, M.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Emergence of complex society in Korea|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=6|pages=51–95|doi=10.1007/BF00997585|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the archaeology sites dating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, hundreds of cemeteries with thousands of [[burial]]s have been excavated. The vast majority of archaeological evidence of the Three Kingdoms Period of Korea consists of burials, but since the 1990s there has been a great increase in the archaeological excavations of ancient industrial production sites, roads, palace grounds and [[elite]] precincts, ceremonial sites, commoner households, and fortresses due to the boom in [[salvage archaeology]] in South Korea.

Some individual correlates of complex societies are found in the chiefdoms of Korea that date back to c. 700 BC (e.g. see [[Igeum-dong]], [[Songguk-ri]]).&lt;ref name=Rhee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bale, Martin T.  |author2=Ko, Min-jung  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006|title= Craft Production and Social Change in Mumun Pottery Period Korea|journal=Asian Perspectives|volume=45|issue=2|pages=159–187|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/asian_perspectives/v045/45.2bale.pdf |doi=10.1353/asi.2006.0019|hdl=10125/17250  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best evidence from the archaeological record in Korea indicates that states formed between 300 BC and 300/400 AD.&lt;ref name=Kang1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kang2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L.

The correlates of state-level societies did not develop as a package, but rather in spurts and starts and at various points in time. It was some time between 100–400 AD that individual correlates of state societies had developed to a sufficient number and scale that state-level societies can be confidently identified using archaeological data.

===Burials===

Lee Sung-joo analyzed variability in many of the [[elite]] cemeteries of the territories of Silla and Gaya polities and found that as late as the 2nd century there was intra-cemetery variation in the distribution of prestige [[grave goods]], but there was an absence of hierarchical differences on a regional scale between cemeteries. Near the end of the 2nd century AD, interior space in elite burials increased in size, and wooden chamber burial construction techniques were increasingly used by elites. In the 3rd century, a pattern developed in which single elite cemeteries that were the highest in status compared to all the other cemeteries were built. Such cemeteries were established at high elevations along ridgelines and on hilltops. Furthermore, the uppermost elite were buried in large-scale tombs established at the highest point of a given cemetery.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Cemeteries with 'uppermost elite' mounded burials such as Okseong-ri, Yangdong-ri, Daeseong-dong, and Bokcheon-dong display this pattern.
[[File:Korea-Goguryeo-Roof.tiles-01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Roof tiles excavated from Goguryeo archaeological sites in the Han River valley, from [[National Museum of Korea]].]]

===Factory-scale production of pottery and roof-tiles===

Lee Sung-joo proposed that, in addition to the development of regional political hierarchies as seen through analysis of burials, variation in types of pottery production gradually disappeared and full-time specialization was the only recognizable kind of pottery production from the end of the 4th century A.D. At the same time the production centers for pottery became highly centralized and vessels became [[standardized]].&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

[[Centralisation]] and elite control of production is demonstrated by the results of the archaeological excavations at Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ni in [[Gyeongju]]. These sites are part of what was an interconnected and sprawling ancient industrial complex on the northeast outskirts of the Silla capital. Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ri are an example of the large-scale of specialized [[factory]]-style production in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla Periods. The site was excavated in the late 1990s, and archaeologists found the remains of many production features such as [[pottery]] [[kiln]]s, roof-tile kilns, [[charcoal]] kilns, as well as the remains of buildings and [[workshop]]s associated with production.

===Capital cities, elite precincts, and monumental architecture===

Since the establishment of Goguryeo, its early history is well attested archaeologically: The first and second [[Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom|capital cities]], [[Wunü Mountain|Jolbon]] and [[Gungnae Fortress|Gungnae]] city, located in and around today's [[Ji'an, Jilin]]. In 2004, the site was designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. Since 1976, continuing archaeological excavations concentrated in the southeastern part of modern [[Gyeongju]] have revealed parts of the so-called ''Silla Wanggyeong'' (Silla royal capital). A number of excavations over the years have revealed [[Buddhist temple|temples]] such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], Bunhwangsa, Heungryunsa, and 30 other sites. Signs of Baekje's capitals have also been excavated at the Mongchon Fortress and the [[Pungnap Toseong|Pungnap Fortress]] in [[Seoul]].

[[Image:RRTA Optima Trolley side.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Optima Bus Corporation|Optima]] tourist trolley operated by [[Red Rose Transit Authority|RRTA]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].]]

A '''tourist trolley''', also called a '''road trolley''', is a rubber-tired [[bus]] designed to resemble an old-style [[tram|streetcar or tram]]. The vehicles are usually fueled by [[diesel fuel|diesel]], or sometimes [[compressed natural gas]].

The name refers to the [[American English]] usage of the word ''trolley'' to mean an electric streetcar. As these vehicles are not actually [[Trolley car|trolleys]], and to avoid confusion with [[trolley bus]]es,  the [[American Public Transportation Association]] (APTA) refers to them as "trolley-replica buses".&lt;ref name="APTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm  |title=Bus and Trolleybus Definitions |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074721/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/bus/definitions.cfm |archivedate = 2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Tourist trolleys are used by both [[Municipality|municipal]] and private operators.  Municipal operators may mix tourist trolleys in with the regular service bus fleet to add more visitor interest or attract attention to new routes. In many cities tourist trolleys are used as circulators.&lt;ref&gt;A circulator operates a simplified route limited to popular destinations on a fixed schedule with a reduced or free fare.  See ref [1] for definition.&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist trolleys are also run by private operators to carry [[Tourism|tourist]]s to popular destinations.

In [[San Francisco]], tourist trolleys mimic the city's famous [[San Francisco cable car system|cable cars]].

Tourist trolleys sometimes operate in places which also have streetcars. For example, tourist trolleys operate in [[Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitphilly.com/tours/philadelphia/philadelphia-trolley-works-76-carriage-company/|title=Philadelphia Trolley Works (&amp;#8216;76 Carriage Company) — visitphilly.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also has [[SEPTA Subway–Surface Trolley Lines|actual trolley service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/maps/trolley/city.html|title=SEPTA - Route 10, 11, 13, 15, 34 &amp; 36 Trolley Line Map|website=www.septa.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
[[File:Water marble nail method3.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dragging]]
[[File:Water marble nail method2.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dropping]]
There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|woodcraft or woodlore|Woodcraft retail stores, catalogs and magazine |Woodcraft Supply}}

The term '''woodcraft''' — or '''woodlore''' — denotes skills and experience in matters relating to living and thriving in the [[woodland|woods]]—such as [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and [[camping]]—whether on a short- or long-term basis. Traditionally, woodcraft pertains to [[subsistence]] lifestyles, with implications of [[hunting-gathering]]. In more recent times, and in [[developed countries]], it relates more to either outdoor [[recreation|recreationalism]] or [[survivalism]]. 

Whether traditional or modern, ''woodcraft'' may be roughly equated to the phrase "'''living off the land'''".

==Techniques==
A partial list of recreational woodcraft techniques might include knowledge of [[wildlife]] behavior, identifying and utilizing wild plants and animals (especially for food), [[Cooking on a campfire|camp cooking]], [[orienteering]] (including [[hiking]] skills and use of a [[map]] and [[compass]]), [[Making fire|fire making]] (including procurement of [[Wood fuel|firewood]]), selecting and preparing a [[campsite]], [[Lashing knot|lashing]] and [[knot]] techniques, the use of [[tent]]s and [[wilderness first aid]].  

==Contexts and significance==
The [[Scouting]] movement has adopted woodcraft techniques as a core skill set known as [[scoutcraft]].

In the United States, woodcraft techniques in a military context are taught as part of [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) training.

Traditional woodcraft has particular importance in [[American folklore]], especially that relating to the early [[Frontier#United States|American frontier]].

In the UK, the [[Woodcraft Folk]] are an organisation founded on the principles of woodcraft.

'''Writing''' is a medium of human [[communication]] that represents [[language]] and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or [[spoken language]]. Writing is not a language, but a [[tool]] used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called ''text'', and the recipient of text is called a ''reader''. Motivations for writing include [[publication]], [[storytelling]], correspondence, [[record keeping]] and [[diary]]. Writing has been instrumental in keeping [[history]], maintaining [[culture]], dissemination of knowledge through the [[Mass media|media]] and the formation of [[legal systems]].

As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in [[Mesopotamia]] outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}} In both [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.

== Means for recording information ==
[[H.G. Wells]] argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Short History of the World |first=H.

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main article|Writing system}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alphabet]]ic writing is a frequent category in [[human communication]]. ]]
The major [[writing system]]s—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: [[logographic]], [[Syllable|syllabic]], [[alphabetic]], [[featural]], and [[ideographic]] (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, [[pictographic]], is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.

====Logographies====
A [[logogram]] is a written character which represents a word or [[morpheme]]. A vast number of logograms are needed to write [[Chinese characters]], [[cuneiform]], and [[Mayan script|Mayan]], where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese "radicals", hieroglyphic "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for "fin", pronounced "ka", was also used to represent the syllable "ka" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a ''radical'' with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a ''phonetic''. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.

The main logographic system in use today is [[Chinese characters]], used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of [[languages of China|China]], [[languages of Japan|Japan]], and sometimes in [[Korean language|Korean]] despite the fact that in [[South Korea|South]] and [[North Korea]], the phonetic [[Hangul]] system is mainly used.

====Syllabaries====
A [[syllabary]] is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable "ka" may look nothing like the syllable "ki", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the [[Linear B]] script for [[Mycenaean Greek]]; [[Cherokee]]; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], an English-based [[creole language]] of [[Surinam]]; and the [[Vai language|Vai]] script of [[Liberia]]. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]], though technically an [[abugida]], has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.

====Alphabets====
{{See also|History of the alphabet}}

An [[alphabet]] is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

As languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

=====Abjads=====
In most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called ''[[abjad]]s'', derived from the Arabic word for "alphabet".

=====Abugidas=====
In most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called ''[[abugida]]s''. Some abugidas, such as [[Ethiopic]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree]], are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called "syllabics". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.

Sometimes the term "alphabet" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] is often considered to be the first alphabet.

====Featural scripts====
A featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters "b" and "p"; however, labial "m" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking "q" and "d" are not labial. In Korean [[hangul]], however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.

Another featural script is [[SignWriting]], the most popular writing system for many [[sign languages]], where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented [[secular icon|iconically]]. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tengwar]].

====Historical significance of writing systems====
[[Image:Olin-Warner-LoC-tympanum-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] representing Writing, above exterior of main entrance doors, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington DC, 1896.]]

Historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.

Writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.

===Tools and materials===
{{See also|writing implements}}
The many tools and writing materials used throughout history include [[stone tablet]]s, [[clay tablet]]s, bamboo slats, [[papyrus]], [[wax tablet]]s, [[vellum]], [[parchment]], [[paper]], [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], [[stylus]]es, [[quill]]s, [[ink brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[pen]]s, and many styles of [[lithography]]. The Incas used knotted cords known as [[quipu]] (or khipu) for keeping records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html|title=The Khipu Database Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typewriter]] and various forms of [[word processor]]s have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
{{Main article|Proto-writing|History of writing}}

===Neolithic writing===
[[File:Tărtăria Amulet.png|thumb|250px|Amulet of the [[Tărtăria tablets]], the earliest found example of the [[Old European script]] and of human writing in the world generally, dating to 5500–5300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, Harald (2002). ''Geschichte der Schrift'', C.H. Beck, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that was in [[Romania]] and neighbouring regions.]]

By definition, the modern practice of [[history]] begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of [[prehistory]]. The [[Dispilio Tablet]] (Greece), [[Jiahu symbols]] (China) and [[Tărtăria tablets]] (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the [[6th millennium BC]], are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.

===Mesopotamia===
While neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}}

[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Globular envelope with a cluster of accountancy tokens, Uruk period, from [[Susa]]. [[Louvre Museum]]]]

Archaeologist [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat]] determined the link between previously uncategorized clay "tokens", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, [[Mesopotamian]] [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=2000| pages=48–57| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of [[pictographs]]. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.

===Elamite scripts===
Over the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.
[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly [[logogram|logographic]].

[[Linear Elamite]] is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably [[:de:Walther Hinz|Walther Hinz]] and [[:it:Piero Meriggi|Piero Meriggi]].

The [[Elamite cuneiform]] script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.

====Cretan and Greek scripts====
{{Further information|Cretan hieroglyphs|Linear A|Linear B}}

[[Cretan hieroglyphs]] are found on artifacts of [[Crete]] (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). [[Linear B]], the writing system of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."/&gt; has been deciphered while [[Linear A]] has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."&gt;{{harvnb|Olivier|1986|pp=377f.}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name group="A"&gt;Beginning date refers to first attestations, the assumed origins of all scripts lie further back in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the [[Aegean Islands]] ([[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Cythera (island)|Kythera]], [[Milos|Melos]], [[Santorini|Thera]]), and the [[Greek mainland]] ([[Laconia]]) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete ([[Knossos]]), and mainland ([[Pylos]], [[Mycenae]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tiryns]]) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.

===China===
{{Further information|Oracle bone script|Bronzeware script}}

The earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of [[Jiahu symbols|isolated tortoise-shell carvings]] dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|196px|thumbnail|right|[[Narmer Palette]], with the two serpopards representing unification of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], [[3000 B.C.|3000 B. C.]]]]
The earliest known [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are the [[Narmer Palette]], dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was [[logogram|logographic]] with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|alphabet]].

Writing was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.

The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwasser, Orly. "How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs", Biblical Archaeology Review, Mar/Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the "Mistress of turquoise". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on [[hieroglyph]]ic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.

===Indus Valley===
{{Main article|Indus script}}

Indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (which spanned modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]]) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early [[Harappa]] after 3500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David (1999). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm 'Earliest writing' found]" BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left,&lt;ref&gt;(Lal 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes follows a [[boustrophedonic]] style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600,&lt;ref&gt;(Wells 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic&lt;ref&gt;(Bryant 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an [[agglutinative]] language underlies the script.

===Central Asia===
In 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in [[Central Asia]] that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near [[Ashgabat]], the capital of [[Turkmenistan]], revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient writing found in Turkmenistan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1330705.stm |quote=A previously unknown civilisation was using writing in Central Asia 4,000 years ago, hundreds of years before Chinese writing developed, archaeologists have discovered.

===Phoenician writing system and descendants===
The [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script, in which [[Proto-Canaanite]] is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from [[Hieratic]], [[Cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]], who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The [[Cumae alphabet]], a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Rune]]s. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used to write [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic script]]s are descended.

The [[Tifinagh]] script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.

===Mesoamerica===
A stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the [[Cascajal Block]], was discovered in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing by approximately 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Western Hemisphere. |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Briggs |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |first=Maria del Carmen |last=Rodríguez Martínez |display-authors=etal |year=2006 |volume=313 |issue=5793 |pages=1610–1614 |doi=10.1126/science.1131492 |pmid=16973873 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico.

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112|bibcode=2006Sci...311.1281S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.

===South America===
The [[Incas]] had no known script. Their [[quipu]] system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Dacia===
Three stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist [[Nicolae Vlassa]], in the mid-20th century (1961) in [[Tărtăria]] (present-day [[Alba County]], [[Transylvania]]), [[Romania]], ancient land of [[Dacia]], inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the [[Getae]]s and [[Thracians]].
One of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], as well as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and [[Iberian scripts|Iberian]].
The origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence [[in situ]], the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the [[Cluj]] museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.

==Modern importance==
In the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as [[technology]] has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. [[Literacy]] has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the [[writing center]] and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their [[socioeconomic status]].

Other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the [[World Literacy Foundation]] and [[International Literacy Foundation]], as well as a general push for increased global communication.
