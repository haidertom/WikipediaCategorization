'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Albania]] the right to access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution and by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014 and providing for a sound legal framework regulating access to public information.&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/rudina-hoxha-editor-follow-business-albania |title="A problem is its efficient implementation"  |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website=Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date= 25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some significant progress toward securing the right to information over the last years, notable weakness remains in the functioning of the system and in the implementation of the law. Access is still a challenge in a country with a strong culture of secrecy and confidentiality.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |title=Implementing Right to Information. A Case study of Albania |url=http://www.right2info.org/resources/publications/publications/wb_implementing-rti_albania_2012 |publisher= The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / the World Bank |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Albania provides both constitutional and legal guarantees of the right to information. Efforts to establish a constitutional and legal framework securing citizens' right to access public information date back to the early 1990s during Albania's transition from a Communist country to a multi-party democratic system.&lt;ref name=WB/&gt;

The Constitution, effective since 1998, enshrined this right in Article 23 and provides for the right of every person to access information held by state bodies and to attend public meetings.&lt;ref name=OSCE&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Banisar |date=April 2006 |title= Comments and Legal Regulations on Access to Information and State Secrets in Albania |url=https://www.osce.org/fom/18934?download=true  |publisher= OSCE. The Representative on Freedom of the Media |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the parliament passed the Law 8503, the ''Right to Information about Official Documents law'', becoming the first country in the region to adopt a legislation on freedom of information.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Currently, access to information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information approved in 2014, which is an upgrade of previous laws and regulations.&lt;ref name="BIRN"&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 2006 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  
|publisher= Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albania has also committed itself to realize the right to access public information through several  international agreements. In 2002, Albania ratified the Convention on access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters ([[Aarhus Convention]]) which requires the adoption of laws on access to environmental information. Moreover, as a member of the [[Council of Europe]], Albania has committed to comply with a 2002 recommendation on access to official document.&lt;ref name="OSCE" /&gt;

==Legal Framework==

The new Right to Information Law of Albania has been assessed by many experts as one of the most important steps towards transparency and accountability, bringing Albanian legislation closer with the best international standards.&lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://idfi.ge/en/new%E2%80%93freedom%E2%80%93of%E2%80%93ifnromation%E2%80%93legislation%E2%80%93albania  |title=New Right to Information Law in Albania |last= |first= |date= 7 November 2014 |website=Idfi.ge |publisher= Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI) |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-foia-law-could-usher-era-of-transparency-in-albania   |title=Albania Rights Groups Hail New New FOI Law |last= |first= |date= 1 October 2014 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law provided greater access for the public to official documents, and sets forth a system of penalties for public officials who refused to disclose information.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The new legislation includes also an array of new concepts, such as the possibility of reclassifying secret documents, the release of partial information and the use of [[Information and communications technology|ICTs]] to make information held py public bodies available and accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; The law also establishes the obligation to appoint coordinators for access to information by every public authority charged with the task of supervising the authority’s responses to information requests and created the institution of a Commissioner for the Right to Information and Protection of Personal Data charged with supervising and monitoring compliance with the law and appeals bodies and procedures in cases of refusal or partial disclosure.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Under the new law the Commissioner has the faculty to use disciplinary sanctions against those violating the requirements established in the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The sanction system for failure to respect the right to information has been strengthened with the introduction of heavy administrative sanctions for officials violating the law.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

Furthermore, the new has broadened the scope of the definition of the term “public information” defined as any data registered in any form and format, maintained by a public authority as well as the definition of the term “public authority” which now encompasses commercial companies where the state hold the majority of shares, as well as any legal entity exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; Proactivity of publication for certain categories of information has been introduced.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

The law establishes that requests for information of public interest can be made orally or in writing.&lt;ref name="BIRN" /&gt; The provision of information is free of charge: the law only enables public bodies to charge the costs for photocopying; no charge can be applied to electronic delivery.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to give an answer within 10 days from the submission of the request (under the previous legal framework it was 40).&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt; In case the request is rejected, the applicant has the right to appeal to the Commissioner and then to the courts.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

Exceptions to the right to information are established by the law, including for reasons of national security and international and intergovernmental relations.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the improvements introduced by the new legal framework, the effectiveness of its implementation still remains to be seen. According to the journalist Rudina Hoxha, one of the problem is that the two institutions that should monitor the application of the law, meaning the Information and Data Protection Commissioner and the Ombudsman, have in fact a counseling character and even though by the law they are entitled to apply sanctions, this happens very rarely.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;

According to a 2016 report by the NGO ''Mjaft Movement'', Albanian public institutions comply with their obligations to provided public information under FOI requests only in 42% of the cases. To test and monitor the application of the new law, the organisation submitted 230 requests for information to different public bodies, including central institutions, local ones, justice institutions and public universities. Out of 230 requests, only 98 replies were obtained. Only 80 of these answers disclosed the required information. The remaining 18 were cases of incomplete information provision.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albanian-institutions-difficulties-in-doing-transparency-07-11-2016   |title=Albanian institutions fail a transparency test |last= |first= |date= 12 July 2016 |website=BalkanInsight.com |publisher=BalkanInsight |access-date=25 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found out that Albanian municipalities were the most problematic and opaque institutions in terms of applying the FOI law. The main problem concerned non-compliance with the obligation to appoint the coordinator on the right to information and great lack of transparency on budget and financial issues.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life.

In the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]], the Law on Access to Official Documents was enacted in 2010. The law repealed and superseded various other legislation and administrative orders that were previously in force.&lt;ref name=K2.0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/kosovar-journalists-need-demand-implementation-access-information-rights |title=Kosovar journalists need to demand implementation of their access to information rights|last=Sheremeti |first=Furtuna |date=31 January 2017 |website=Kosovotwopointzero.com |publisher=Kosovo 2.0 |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution. Several secondary acts aims at realizing the right and implement the 2010 Law. However, full implementation is lacking, the courts are slow to respond to appeals due to persistent backlogs in the judicial system.&lt;ref name=FH2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/kosovo |title=Kosovo. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date= 2015 |website=FreedomHouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the appeals process work, the institutions appear willing to ignore the rulings of the court when it comes to transparency and access to public information.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in 2016, the law on access to public documents is undergoing a procedure of amendment together with other laws to which it should be harmonized.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

==Legal framework==
In Kosovo [[Access to public information in Europe|access to public information]] is a right guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution which establishes that every person is entitled of the right of access to public information and that documents held by public institutions and organs of state authorities are public, except for information that can be concealed by law for reasons due to privacy, business trade secrets or public security.&lt;ref name=kryeministri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Besim M. Kajtazi |date=2013 |title= Legislation Summary on the Right of Access to Public Documents |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/II.__SUMMARY_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_ACCESS_TO_PUBLIC_DOCUMENTS.pdf |publisher=the Republic of Kosovo. The Office of the Prime Minister |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the right of access to official documents is guaranteed by many international agreements and declarations, such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] and Protocols which are directly applicable in the Republic of Kosovo and have priority in case of conflict of applicable laws.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

There are also special laws regulating the application of the right of access to public information, such as the Law on Administrative procedure and the Law on Civil Service of the Republic of Kosovo.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

Specifically, to implement the constitutional right of every person to have access, upon request, to documents of public interest held by public authorities, in 2010 the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo approved the '''Law no. 03/L-215 on Access to Public Documents (LAPD).''' The LAPD Law applies to all documents maintained, drafted and received by public institutions and is based on ten principles:
* everyone has the right of access to information;
* access is the rule, secret is the exception;
* the law applies to all public bodies;
* the request should be simple, fast and free for the requester;
* officials have the duty to support the applicants in their search for information;
* the refusal should be justified;
* public interest is more important than secret;
* the right to appeal is guaranteed in case of negative reply;
* public authorities should proactively publish basic information;
* the right to information should be guaranteed by an independent body.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

===Procedures for exercising the right of access to information===
Requesting and obtaining public information is free of charge. A fee may only be charged to applicants for copies of the document requested and have to be reasonable and aiming at only covering the actual costs of reproduction and document delivery.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt; Exceptions to the right of access to public information can be applied and are defined by law.

According to the relevant law, access to public information may be restricted only for the purpose of protecting the public legitimate interests of life or other legitimate private interests, such as the right to privacy and for public security reasons.&lt;ref name="kryeministri" /&gt;  Other reasons for exceptions include: defence and international relations; detection and investigation of criminal activities, disciplinary investigations, atc.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

The request can be made in writing or orally.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

Public institutions have to respond to citizens' requests within seven days with their decision to fully or partially grant the access. The deadline for review may be exceptionally extended to 15 days.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

The respect of the right of access to public information is guaranteed by the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson Institution]], an independent body supporting citizens to realize the right of access to documents that have been denied, according to the Law on Ombudsperson.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

In case of rejection of the applicant's request, and non-response by the relevant authority within the deadline, the applicant can start an appeal procedure in front of the Ombudsperson Institutions or the competent courts, in accordance with applicable law.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

The implementation of the laws on access to public information is problematic.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report, in practice the right of access to public information is “undermined by the authorities’ fragmented and unclear approach”.&lt;ref name=CE2016&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=9 November 2016 |title= Commission staff working Document Kosovo* 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_kosovo.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, according to the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)]]  the realization of the right is hindered by a secretive mentality and culture of many public authorities in the country.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drejtesianekosove.com/repository/docs/report_on_access_to_public_documents_2013-2014_824655.pdf |title=Report on Access to Public Documents 2013-2014 |last= |first= |date=June 2014 |website= |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, According to the news portal [[Kosovo 2.0]], institutions tend to disclose information on less important issues and when lower level institutions, such as municipalities, are involved.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Other flaws in the application of the law consists in its misinterpretation, for instance in distinguishing between what to consider private and what a public interest, and the application of ''ad hoc'' administrative measures by certain institutions. According to Kosovo 2.0, even when the law is very clear in specifying procedures, certain institutions have created their own procedures which are not always in line with the law, resulting in barriers for interested applicants. For instance, there are numerous institutions requiring the payment of 1 euro when filling a freedom of information request, which is in contradiction with the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Another problem concerns the officials who are responsible for receiving and processing freedom of information requests. According to Kosovo 2.0 in many cases they are not properly trained to effectively execute the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

In Kosovo, the majority of requests for accessing public information are submitted by journalists, activists and civil society organizations, and very few by citizens that are not fully aware of their right of access to public information.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to a survey carried out in 2012, the level of knowledge about the content of the law on access to public information among citizens was extremely deficient, as well as their interest in making requests for access to public documents.&lt;ref name=FOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://levizjafol.org/folnew/kosovo-with-a-low-level-of-implementation-of-the-law-on-access-to-public-documents/?lang=en   |title=Kosovo with a low level of implementation of the law on access to public documents |last= |first= |date= 28 September 2012 |website=Levizjafol.org |publisher=Lëvizja FOL Movement |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test and monitor the implementation of the law, BIRN has submitted a series of requests for information to the majority of public institutions, at all levels, in Kosovo. From June 2013 to May 2014, it submitted a total of 125 official requests: of the requests submitted, 68 were denied, 50 approved and 7 partially denied, meaning that requested documents were received in only 40 per cent of cases. This result is considered as “rather poor” by the organisation.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; During the same monitoring period, one of the major problems observed by BIRN concerned access to courts information, in particular indictments.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; Another common problem highlighted by the organization is that, in practice and despite the law’s provisions, the institution that does not have the information requested usually rejects the requests, rather than forwarding it to another  institution that may have it as required by the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; According to another test, implemented between October 2013 to April 2016, only 25 per cent of BIRN’s requests were approved and 38 were rejected.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

The legal [[age of consent]] for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across Asia, from age 12 to 21 years of age. The specific activity engaged in or the gender of its participants can also be affected by the law. Below is a discussion of the various laws dealing with this subject. The highlighted age refers to an age at or above which an individual can engage in unfettered sexual relations with another who is also at or above that age. Other variables, such as homosexual relations or close in age exceptions, may exist, and are noted when relevant, for example in Indonesia.

The below is a list of all jurisdictions in Asia as listed in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia]].

Under s.124 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap.200),&lt;ref name=s/&gt; a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

Hence, a woman who has sexual activity with a boy or a girl under 16 will be prosecuted under this section.

The previous position regarding homosexual couples is contained in s.118C which provides that a man who commits or suffers to commit buggery with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/200/s118c.html |title=Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) s.118C |publisher=HKLII |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this section was struck down as unconstitutional in ''[[Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk/lrs/common/search/search_result_detail_frame.jsp?DIS=54227&amp;QS=%2B&amp;TP=JU&amp;currpage=T |title=CACV No. 317 of 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the age of consent between two males have been effectively equalized with that between a male and a female, which is 16.

Prior to 2012 there was a presumption that a male minor under 14 could not consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances. The law was changed after a 13-year-old boy attacked a 5-year-old girl at a [[Chai Wan]] hospital ward; the prosecution was unable to convict him of rape, instead only able to do so for indecent assault. In 2015 an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were arrested after they were found having sex with an 11-year-old girl. Under the new laws they have the possibility of having the maximum sentence of life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Clifford and Lana Lam.

=== Legal action on Marital Rape ===
 Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 disallows any such sexual relationships and puts such crimes within marriages as an aggravated offense. A Public Interest Litigation filled by Independent Thought, an organization working on child rights law, was heard in the Supreme Court of India for declaring the exception allowing marital rape within prohibited child marriages as unconstitutional: ''Independent Thought vs. Union of India [W.P(civil) 382 of 2013]''. In the judgment, delivered on October 11, the Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta read down Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to hold that sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife if she is below 18 years of age would amount to rape.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]], an old British-era law, bans "carnal intercourse against the order of nature". It was used to prosecute people for having anal or oral sex, although prosecutions are rare. The law was constitutionally challenged at the [[Delhi High Court]] in 2009 for violating the human rights of sexual minorities. But, after the Delhi High Court declared some parts of the law unconstitutional on the issue, the age of consent for consensual homosexual sex was set at 18.&lt;ref name="homo_sex"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-high-court-legalises-gay-sex/484039/ |title=Delhi HC invokes Nehru, legalises gay sex |newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]   |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==
According to the Indonesian Penal Code article 287, the age of consent in [[Indonesia]] is 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana|last=Kejaksaan Negeri|publisher=Kejaksaan Negeri|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 14 or younger in Indonesia are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape or the equivalent local law.

Even though the age of consent is 15 years old, the offender can only be charged and prosecuted if a legal complaint is lodged to the law enforcement. Exception to this law is when the age of the victim is under 12 years old, or under certain circumstances such as bodily injury or incest.

However, under the Child Protection Act, the age of consent could be raised to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law of The Republic Of Indonesia Number 35 Year 2014 Concerning Amendment To Law Number 23 Year 2002 Regarding Child Protection|last=Kejaksaan Negeri|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used is that sexual acts with a child could result in bodily and mental injury, while the definition of a child is anyone who is under 18 years old.

==Israel==
According to the Israeli Penal Code of 1977 the age of consent in [[Israel]] is 16 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, for any form of sexual relations involving penetration (unless the person above 16 is the one being penetrated - in that case the age of consent is 14). In all cases that don't involve penetration, the age of consent is 14 (for both heterosexual and homosexual activities ). A special case arises when a person aged 14 or 15 had sexual relations with an older partner; in this case the older partner would be exempt of criminal liability if three conditions are met: the age difference between the partners was less than three years, the younger partner gave consent and the act was done out of "regular friendly relations" and without the abuse of power.

==Syria==
Any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in [[Syria]]

The age of consent in [[Syria]] is 18, per ''Article 491''.

''Article 491'':

1. Every person who has sexual intercourse with a minor under 15 years of age shall be liable to a term of nine years' imprisonment at hard labour.

2. The said term shall be not less than 15 years if the child is under 12 years of age.

==Taiwan==
The age of consent in [[Taiwan]] is 16 regardless of sex. The sentence is reduced or exempted if the offender is under 19. If the offender is under 18, it's an [[Antragsdelikt|offense indictable only upon a complaint]].&lt;ref&gt;ROC Criminal Law, Article 227, 227–1 229–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tajikistan==
The age of consent in [[Tajikistan]] is 16, as specified in article 141 of the Criminal Code. The penalty is specified as deprivation of freedom for 2 to 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1707/file/207b8150765af2c85ad6f5bb8a44.htm/preview |title=Tajikistan Criminal Code |publisher=Legislationline.org |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Article 141. Sexual Intercourse And Other Actions of Sexual Character With an Individual Under 16 Years of Age''

"(1) Sexual intercourse, homosexuality or lesbianism committed by an individual at the age of 18 years with an individual under 16 years of age when there are no elements of the crime stipulated by Article 138 and Article 139 of the present Code, is punishable by deprivation of freedom for a period of 2 to 5 years."

It should be noted, however, that articles 138 and 139 provide harsher penalties for Rape and Forcible sex against minors, including the possible death penalty for rape of a girl under 14.

==Thailand==
The age of consent in [[Thailand]] is 15 regardless of gender or sexual orientation, as specified by article 279 of the Thai Criminal Code. The current legislation applies to all regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

However, parts of the [http://www.thailawonline.com/images/documents/Criminal%20Code%20of%20Thailand.pdf''Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act''], which disallow any sexual contact with prostitutes under the age of 18, are widely interpreted by some local authorities to cover sexual acts classed as "obscenity for personal gratification". Also, from the [http://www.thailawonline.com/images/documents/Criminal%20Code%20of%20Thailand.pdf''Penal Code Amendment Act''of 1997 Section 283bis], having sex with an adolescent under 18 is a compoundable offense even with the consent of that person. The parent or the adolescent may file charges against the other side if they later regret their own action. This ostensibly makes the Thai unfettered age of consent 18.

A high-profile example of this application of the law was a [[statutory rape]] charge filed against the lead singer of the Thai band ''[[Big Ass]]'' for allegedly having had sex with a (then) 16-year-old girl. The charge was filed by the girl after the singer refused to take responsibility for her baby. The singer has since been cleared of being the baby's father due to the results of a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] and he received 2 years [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/05/20/national/national_30004480.php |title=DNA test clears 'Dag' |date=20 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30029866 |title=Popular rocker given suspended jail term for having sex with underage girl |date=30 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090612143232/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30029866|archivedate=12 June 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yemen==
Any kind of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal in [[Yemen]]. Until recently, Yemeni law set the age of consent at 15. But tribal customs often trump the law.

{{Contract law}}

A '''bonus clause''' is a clause in a contract that rewards the contractor for doing more than the letter of the contract; particularly, to finish the job early. It is in apposition to a [[Penal damages|penalty clause]] where the contractor loses by providing less than the letter of the contract, or providing it later than agreed.

The aim of a bonus clause is to give a [[win-win situation]] whereby the contractor wins by getting more money for finishing early, and the holder of the contract wins by having a product earlier to market.

'''CaseMap''' was introduced 1998 as [[relational database]] [[software]] for law offices to store and retrieve [[evidence]] and sources of evidence in litigation. It includes [[Table (database)|database table]]s (the program's documentation refers to them as ''spreadsheets'') for facts, issues, documents, [[physical evidence]], [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, [[pleading]]s, persons, organizations, places, and other types of data. The program's documentation refers to these types of data as ''objects''. Using the program involves linking the various sources of evidence (e.g., documents, [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s, and persons) to facts that are relevant in the case and to the issues to be decided in the case. The facts table can be sorted by date to provide a chronology of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The use of large volumes of [[digital evidence]] and [[e-discovery]] in modern litigation has led law offices to increase their use of litigation support programs such as CaseMap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]] IV:13.5.8, p. *169}} 
[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W. Fairholt|title=On a Grotesque Mask of Punishment Obtained in the Castle of Nuremberg|publisher=J.H. Parker for the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|location= 377, Strand. London|year=1855|pages=62–64|volume=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th-century [[New England]] and [[Long Island]], scolds or those convicted of similar offences—both men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the scold's bridle,&lt;ref name="AME2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=Branks and gags|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-8.html|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ducking stool also made the trip across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="AME" /&gt;

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v. Marion Palendrano |vol= 120 N.J.

None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

A '''constitutional dictatorship''' is a form of government in which dictatorial powers are exercised during an emergency. The dictator is not absolute and the dictator's authority remains limited by the constitution.

The [[Roman Republic]] made provision for a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] who could govern unchecked for a stipulated period of time. Unlike other magistrates, a dictator was not subject to review of his actions at the conclusion of his term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Dictator.html A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875.], Dictator&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] has a similar dictator clause stating that the President "may adjourn [congress] to such Time as he shall think proper" if the two houses disagree on when to adjourn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html Constitution of the United States], Article II, Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Abraham Lincoln]], President of the United States during the American Civil War, exercised extraordinary powers to preserve the Union. Lincoln's dictatorial actions included directly ordering the arrest and detention of dissenters and the suspension of the right to writs of habeas corpus. However, Lincoln remained subject to Congressional oversight, judicial review, and periodic elections.

The [[Weimer Republic]], which succeeded [[Imperial Germany]] after the [[First World War]], adopted a constitutional provision that expressly enabled the president to rule by decree, without consultation with the legislative branch. That provision was used by Chancellor [[Hitler]] to consolidate his powers upon his selection by President [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]].

US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] also exercised extraordinary powers in response to the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Second World War]]. Roosevelt's actions included violating the US Constitution's [[Contract Clause]], the closing of banks, and a moratorium on [[foreclosure]]s. Later, meeting a perceived threat by Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans, Roosevelt ordered their [[internment of Japanese Americans|relocation to internment camps]].

In the 21st century, [[John Yoo]], attorney and legal theorist, has offered a theory of the unitary executive for massive authority of the US President, in his capacity as [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. Yoo provided the intellectual foundation for many of the actions undertaken by the [[George W. Bush administration]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1545">'''Countersigning''' means writing a second [[signature]] onto a [[document]]. For example, a contract or other official document signed by the representative of a company may be countersigned by his supervisor to verify the [[Agency (law)|authority of the representative]]. Also, a [[money order]] or other [[financial instrument]] may be signed once upon receipt, then signed again by the same person when presented for payment, as an indication that the bearer is the same person who originally received the item, and not a thief who has stolen the item before it could be carried to the place where it was to be presented.

An example of where a countersignature is needed is with [[UK]] [[passport]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/apply-countersign.asp |author=UK Identity and Passport Service |title=Who can countersign my application? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420224723/http://www.ips.gov.uk/passport/apply-countersign.asp |archivedate=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and [[parliamentary republic]]s, an order by the [[head of state]] (monarch or president) is not valid unless countersigned by another authorised relevant person such as the [[head of government]], a responsible minister, or in case of [[promulgation]] of a parliamentary resolution, a [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the [[legislature]].

{{Professional responsibility}}

'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] or [[admission to practice law]]. Disbarment is usually a punishment for [[Legal ethics|unethical]] or criminal conduct. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].

==Germany==
In Germany, the ''[[Berufsverbot]]'' is a ban on practicing a profession, which can be issued to a lawyer for misconduct, [[Volksverhetzung]] or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.

In April 1933, the Nazi government issued a ''Berufsverbot'' forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the [[Frontkämpferprivileg]].

==United States==
===Overview===
Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most{{Where|date=November 2012}} jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's &lt;!-- DON'T "FIX" THIS TO JUST DESSERTS --&gt;[[just deserts]]&lt;!-- "Desert", from the same French root as deserve, meaning something deserved --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985–1986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Deserts|author1=Gentile, Michael A. |author2=McShea, Sarah Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare (in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rocketlawyer.com/blog/getting-disbarred-is-harder-than-you-think-915832&lt;/ref&gt;). Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.&lt;ref name="reapply"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein }} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable U.S. disbarments===
{{main|List of disbarments in the United States}}
The 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. [[President of the United States|president]] and one former U.S. [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] disbarred, and another president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.

Former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], having pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of [[bribery]] and [[tax evasion]], was disbarred from [[Maryland]], the state of which he had previously been [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].

Former President [[Richard Nixon]] was disbarred from [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;See In re Nixon, 53 A.D.2d 178, 385 N.Y.S.2d 305 (1st Dept. 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nixon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html|date=July 9, 1976 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028075731/http://www.history.com/exhibits/impeach/whthous1.html |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[obstruction of justice]] related to the [[Watergate scandal]].

In 2007, [[Mike Nifong]], the [[District Attorney]] of [[Durham County, North Carolina]] who presided over the [[Duke lacrosse case|2006 Duke University lacrosse case]], was disbarred for [[prosecutorial misconduct]] related to his handling of the case.&lt;ref name="nifong"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3285862&amp;page=1|title=Former Duke Prosecutor Nifong Disbarred|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar [[Andrew Thomas (prosecutor)|Andrew Thomas]], former [[County Attorney]] of [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]]. According to the panel, Thomas "outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law" while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found "clear and convincing evidence" that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/andrew-thomas-disbarred-phoenix-prosecutor_n_1415815.html | work=Huffington Post | first=John | last=Rudolf | title=Arizona Prosecutor Disbarred For Plotting Bad Arrests With 'America's Toughest Sheriff' | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Were this a criminal case," the panel concluded, "we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2012-04-19/news/andy-thomas-needs-a-perp-walk-with-his-papi-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]], the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against video games, rap music, and [[Howard Stern]] was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action was the result of several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson attempted to appeal to the higher courts in order to avoid the penalty actually taking effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5054772/jack-thompson-disbarred|title=Jack Thompson Disbarred|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the US District court, nor the US Supreme Court&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042009zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.

[[F. Lee Bailey]], noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book ''Florida Pulp Nonfiction'' details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7153568/|title=F.

'''Civil procedure doctrines''' are rules developed by [[case law]] as opposed to being set down in [[code]]s or [[legislation]], which, together with [[court]] rules and codes, define the steps that a person involved in a civil [[lawsuit]] can (or can not) take.

==Purpose==
In the United States [[federal jurisdiction]], these [[doctrine]]s have developed to comprehensively deal with certain common issues that arise when a person is involved in bringing, or contemplating bringing a civil lawsuit.

==Other jurisdictions==
Similar doctrines exist In other [[jurisdiction]]s, (however they are sometimes referred to under names other than 'Doctrines of Civil Procedure'), although often they have much less importance.  

For example, in [[England and Wales]], all [[civil procedure]] is covered by the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]], which according to Part 1 of those rules are a 'new [[Procedural law|procedural]] code', and have therefore largely replaced any pre-existing doctrines.

A liability insurance company's '''duty to settle''' is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt "in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Ins. Code}} [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ins&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=790-790.15 § 790.03(h)(5)].&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Typical language is: "We may, at our discretion, investigate any ‘occurrence' and settle any claim or 'suit' that may result." {{sm|Peter J. Kalis et al., Policyholder's Guide to the Law of Insurance Coverage}} F-15 (Aspen Publishers Online 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In California, "an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13974532515441078311&amp;q=comunale&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Comunale v. Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co.], 50 Cal. 2d 654, 659–61 (1958) (ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; A rationale for this duty is that "[w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11597490784555170138&amp;q=merritt+reserve&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co.], 34 Cal. App. 3d 858, 870 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; "An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk. Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&amp;q=johansen+cal&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Johansen v. California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau], 15 Cal. 3d 9, 15-16 (1975) (citations and ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12734399634269452649&amp;q=kinder+western&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Kinder v. Western Pioneer Ins. Co.], 231 Cal. App. 2d 894, 901 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14859133972975123124&amp;q=aguerre&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Aguerre, Inc. v.

[[File:Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts.jpg|right|thumb|Title page of the 1821 original work.]]
{{Hegelianism}}
'''''Elements of the Philosophy of Right''''' ({{lang-de|Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts}}) is a work by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] published in 1820,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Topp, ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft'', Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; though the book's original title page dates it to 1821. Hegel's most mature statement of his [[legal]], [[moral]], [[social]] and [[political]] [[philosophy]], it is an expansion upon concepts only briefly dealt with in the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', published in 1817 (and again in 1827 and 1830). [[Law]] provides for Hegel the cornerstone of the modern state. As such, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s ''The Restoration of the Science of the State'', in which the latter claimed that law was superficial, because [[natural law]] and the "right of the most powerful" was sufficient (§258). The absence of law characterized for Hegel [[despotism]], whether [[monarchy|monarchist]] or [[ochlocracy|ochlocracist]] (§278).

==Summary==
The ''Philosophy of Right'' (as it is usually called) begins with a discussion of the concept of the [[free will]] and argues that the free will can only realize itself in the complicated social context of [[property right]]s and relations, [[contract]]s, moral commitments, [[family]] life, the [[Economics|economy]], the legal system, and the [[polity]]. A person is not truly free, in other words, unless he is a participant in all of these different aspects of the life of the state.

The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing Hegel's three spheres or versions of 'right,' each one larger than the preceding ones and encompassing them. The first sphere is ''abstract right'' (''Recht''), in which Hegel discusses the idea of 'non-interference' as a way of respecting others. He deems this insufficient and moves onto the second sphere, ''morality'' (''Moralität''). Under this, Hegel proposes that humans reflect their own subjectivity of others in order to respect them. The third sphere, ''ethical life'' (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''), is Hegel's integration of individual subjective feelings and universal notions of right. Under ethical life, Hegel then launches into a lengthy discussion about family, civil society, and the state.

Hegel also argues that the state itself is subsumed under the higher totality of world history, in which individual states arise, conflict with each other, and eventually fall. The course of history is apparently toward the ever-increasing actualization of [[Political freedom|freedom]]; each successive historical epoch corrects certain failures of the earlier ones. At the end of his ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', Hegel leaves open the possibility that history has yet to accomplish certain tasks related to the inner organization of the state.

== Reception ==

There were a number of issues that arose during the translation of the text. Most notably the phrase that is contained in the addition to §258, which was initially translated as "The state is the march of God through the world" as well as being translated thus: "The existence of the state is the presence of God upon the earth". From these early translations came the criticism that Hegel justifies authoritarian or even totalitarian forms of government: [[Giovanni Gentile]], whose thought had a strong influence on Mussolini, bases his Hegelian revival on this point. However, [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] argues that the correct translation reads as follows: "It is the way of God in the world, that there should be a state".&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Jerry Z. (2002). ''The Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Western Thought''. New York: A. Knopf. p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the state, rather than being godly, is part of the divine strategy, not a mere product of human endeavor. Kaufmann claims that Hegel's original meaning of the sentence is not a ''carte blanche'' for state dominance and brutality but merely a reference to the state's importance as part of the process of history.

The preface to the ''Philosophy of Right'' contains considerable criticism of the philosophy of [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]], who had been a critic of Hegel's prior work. Included in this is a suggestion that it is justifiable for the state to censor the writings of philosophers like Fries and welcoming Fries' loss of his academic position following Fries' participation in the [[Wartburg Festival]]. The inclusion of this passage has led to scholarly debate as to the reason for Hegel's advocacy of the kind of censorship the Prussian state had introduced following the murder of [[August von Kotzebue]] in the form of the [[Carlsbad Decrees]]. Hegel scholars have suggested that the inclusion of these passages was done to satisfy the censors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Dudley|title=Hegel and the philosophy of right|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415165784|pages=7–9|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T.M. Knox]] argued that, while clearly designed to curry favour with the censors and written well after completion of the work proper, the Preface's condemnation of Fries was "nothing new", that there was no betrayal of his support for the [[Wartburg Festival]] principles, rather a mere denunciation of method, while condemnation of [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]] (whose work had been burned at Wartburg) remained undisturbed in the body of the work.&lt;ref name="Stewart1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

{{global|date=April 2012}}
'''Excusable negligence''' is a [[paradox]]ical phrase, since if the failure to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] under the circumstances is excusable, there is no [[negligence]]. 38 Am J1st Negl § 12.  As used in statutes authorizing the opening of a default and allowing a party to defend [[on the merits]], the standard set by courts is slippery to define, but cases seem to agree that a reasonable excuse is sufficient, where it appears that the defense is meritorious and no substantial prejudice will result from setting aside the default.

'''Freedom of information''' is an extension of [[freedom of speech]], a fundamental [[human right]] recognized in [[international human rights law|international law]], which is today understood more generally  as [[freedom of expression]] in any medium, be it orally, in writing, print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information also refers to the [[right to privacy]] in the content of the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the [[right to privacy]] is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet - Internet Computing, IEEE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, freedom of information can include [[criticism of patents|opposition to patents]], [[Criticism of copyright|opposition to copyrights]] or [[criticism of intellectual property|opposition to intellectual property]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://somerandomnerd.com/node/647|title=Freedom of Information vs. Protection of Intellectual Property}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pirate Parties International|international]] and [[United States Pirate Party]] have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Avast Network, What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law==
In June 2006 nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=211 &amp; 223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=213|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=222|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government bodies ===
As of 2006, 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"/&gt;

=== Private bodies ===
As of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223–224|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer protection ====
In 1983 the [[United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations]] adopted the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] stipulating eight consumer rights, including "consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs". Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Investors ====
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216–217|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=219|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving [[Worldcom]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] and [[Global Crossing]] prompted the [[US Congress]] to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=220|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and information technology==
Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or [[digital rights|restrictions]].

=== The Information Society and freedom of expression ===
The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms [[democracy]] and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] for the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |author2=Veronika  Bauer |author3=Matthias Kettemann  |year=2008 |publisher= Eleven International Publishing |location= |isbn=90-77596-56-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&amp;vq=%22Internet+Bill+of+rights%22&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22&amp;cad=0 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacktivismo ===
{{main|Hacktivismo}}
The [[digital rights]] group [[Hacktivismo]], founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic [[human right]]. The group's beliefs are described fully in the "Hacktivismo Declaration" which calls for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) to be applied to the [[Internet]]. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises "the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet" and calls upon the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] community to "study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored [[censorship]] of the internet" and "implement technologies to challenge information rights violations". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to [[freedom of expression]] is subject to limitations, stating "we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized [[state secrets]], [[child pornography]], and matters related to personal [[privacy]] and [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], among other accepted restrictions." However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states "but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, [[intellectuals]], [[artists]], or religious figures."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Global Network Initiative ===
On October 29, 2008 the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |date=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/global20097.htm Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php Global Network Initiative, Participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports [[Cisco Systems]] was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. [[Harrington Investments]], which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI "meaningless noise" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Glanville"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet censorship ===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Internet police officer chacha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Internet [[police officer]] [[Jingjing and Chacha|Chacha]], one of the [[cartoon]] [[mascots]] of the Internet Surveillance Division of the Public Security Bureau in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]].]] --&gt;
{{main|Internet censorship}}
Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech".&lt;ref name="Glanville"/&gt; The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]].
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Iran Web screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of a blocked website in Iran.]] --&gt;

According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RSF) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Maldives]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 List of the 13 Internet enemies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102000000/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 |date=January 2, 2008 }} RSF, 2006 November&lt;/ref&gt; A widely publicised example is the so-called "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]]s. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | date=2006-02-20 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s, business companies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm|title= II.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], speaking on behalf of the [[United States]], declared 'we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas'. In her 'Remarks on Internet Freedom' she also draws attention to how 'even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable', while reporting President [[Barack Obama]]'s pronouncement 'the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/01/135519.htm |title=Remarks on Internet Freedom |publisher=US Department of State website |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal meaning in the United States ==
Though many fundamental rights are also widely considered human rights, the classification of a right as "fundamental" invokes specific legal tests courts use to determine the constrained conditions under which the United States government and various state governments may limit these rights. In such legal contexts, courts determine whether rights are fundamental by examining the historical foundations of those rights and by determining whether their protection is part of a longstanding tradition. Individual states may guarantee other rights as fundamental. That is, States may add to fundamental rights but can never diminish or infringe upon fundamental rights by legislative processes. Any such attempt, if challenged, may involve a "strict scrutiny" review in court.

== Specific jurisdictions ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Charter of Rights and Freedoms}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] outlines four Fundamental Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html |title=Canadian Charter Of Rights And Freedoms |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are freedom of:
* [[Freedom of conscience|Conscience]] and [[freedom of religion|religion]]
* Thought, belief, opinion, and expression, including [[freedom of the press]] and other media of communication
* Peaceful assembly
* Association.

=== European Union ===
{{Main|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Europe has no identical doctrine (It would be incompatible with the more restrained role of judicial review in European law.) However, EU law recognizes many of the same human rights and protects them through other means.

See also: [[Copenhagen criteria#Human rights|Copenhagen criteria]], and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which every member state of the EU has to comply with and for which the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has final appellate jurisdiction.

=== India ===
The Indian fundamental rights, contrasted with such rights contained in the US bill of rights, present several peculiarities.The fundamental rights in India are far more elaborate than in the United States. Thus, for example, the US bill of rights (first ten amendments) only names some rights. The Supreme Court, through the process of judicial review, decides the limitations on these rights.
{{Main|Fundamental Rights in India}}

There are seven main fundamental rights of India:
* right to [[equality before the law|equality]]
* right to freedom, which includes [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression|expression]], right to assemble peacefully, freedom to form associations or unions, right to move freely throughout the territory of [[India]], right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of [[India]], right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation. 
* right to [[freedom of religion]]
* right against [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]
* cultural and [[right to education|educational rights]]
* right to constitutional remedies
* right to vote(but above 18 years)

Newly implemented 7th Fundamental right in India is
* right to education

It was added in the constitution after the 86th amendment in the year 2002 under article 21A. It is the most recently implemented fundamental right. The RTE Act enabled this right in the year 2010.

A recent addition was made to the list of fundamental rights in India in 2017.
* right to privacy.

=== United States ===
In American [[United States constitutional law|Constitutional Law]], ''fundamental rights'' have special significance under the [[U.S. Constitution]]. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as "fundamental" by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. According to the Supreme Court, enumerated rights that are incorporated are so fundamental that any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be [[narrowly tailored]] to that [[compelling purpose]].

The original interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was that only the Federal Government was bound by it. In 1835, the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Barron v Baltimore]]'' unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the states. During post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] was adopted in 1868 to rectify this condition, and to specifically apply the whole of the Constitution to all U.S. states. In 1873, the Supreme Court essentially nullified the key language of the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment that guaranteed all "[[Privileges and Immunities Clause|privileges and immunities]]" to all U.S. persons, in a series of cases called the [[Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughterhouse cases]]. This decision and others allowed post-emancipation racial discrimination to continue largely unabated.

Later Supreme Court justices found a way around these limitations without overturning the Slaughterhouse precedent: they created a concept called Selective Incorporation. Under this legal theory, the court used the remaining 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment protections for equal protection and due process to [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|"incorporate" individual elements of the Bill of Rights against the states]]. "The test usually articulated for determining fundamentality under the Due Process Clause is that the putative right must be '[[Palko v. Connecticut#Court.27s Decision|implicit in the concept of ordered liberty]]', or '[[Moore v. East Cleveland|deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.]]'" [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14074967920400304312&amp;q=lutz+york&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,48 Compare page 267 Lutz v. City of York, Pa., 899 F. 2d 255 - United States Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit, 1990].

This set in motion a continuous process under which each individual right under the Bill of Rights was incorporated, one by one. That process has extended more than half a century, with the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment]] first incorporated in 1925 in [[Gitlow v New York]]. The most recent amendment completely incorporated as fundamental was the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to possess and [[bear arms]] for personal self-defense, in [[McDonald v Chicago]], handed down in 2010.

Not all clauses of all amendments have been incorporated. For example, states are not required to obey the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s requirement of indictment by [[grand jury]]. Many states choose to use [[preliminary hearing]]s instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.

The Bill of Rights lists specifically enumerated rights. The Supreme Court has extended fundamental rights by recognizing several fundamental rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution, including but not limited to:
* The right to interstate travel
* The right to parent one's children&lt;ref&gt;''[[Troxel v. Granville]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[right to privacy]]&lt;ref&gt;see [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=right+to+privacy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,10&amp;case=12998230422916570030&amp;scilh=0 ''Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford''], 141 U.S. 250 (1891)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right to marriage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' &amp; ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The right of self-defense  
Any restrictions a government statute or policy places on these rights are evaluated with [[strict scrutiny]].  If a right is denied to everyone, it is an issue of [[substantive due process]]. If a right is denied to some individuals but not others, it is also an issue of [[equal protection]]. However, any action that abridges a right deemed fundamental, when also violating equal protection, is still held to the more exacting standard of strict scrutiny, instead of the less demanding rational basis test.

During the [[Lochner era]], the right to [[freedom of contract]] was considered fundamental, and thus restrictions on that right were subject to [[strict scrutiny]].  Following the 1937 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'', though, the right to contract became considerably less important in the context of [[substantive due process]] and restrictions on it were evaluated under the [[rational basis]] standard.

{{Prerogative writs}}
'''''Habeas corpus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|b|i|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s}}; [[Medieval Latin]] meaning literally "that you have the body")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habeas corpus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habeas%20corpus|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Legal recourse|recourse in law]] through which a person can report an [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|unlawful detention or imprisonment]] to a [[court]] and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Habeas Corpus|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/habeas_corpus.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=English|date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is known as "the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;per Blackstone&lt;/ref&gt; It is a summons with the force of a [[court order]]; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' ("protection of freedom").

''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right)&lt;/ref&gt; It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}

The right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z04mTJuMA9KUOOSj3bMC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty&amp;f=false ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the "extraordinary", "[[common law]]", or "[[prerogative writ]]s", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.

==Etymology==
From Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', "to have", "to hold"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', "body". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.

Literally, the phrase means "[we command] that you should have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means "that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarly named writs===
The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish it from similar ancient writs, also named ''habeas corpus''. These include:
* ''Habeas corpus ad deliberandum et recipiendum'': a writ for bringing an accused from a different county into a court in the place where a crime had been committed for purposes of trial, or more literally to return holding the body for purposes of "deliberation and receipt" of a decision. ("[[Extradition]]")
* ''Habeas corpus ad faciendum et recipiendum'' (also called ''habeas corpus cum causa''): a writ of a superior court to a custodian to return with the body being held by the order of a lower court "with reasons", for the purpose of "receiving" the decision of the superior court and of "doing" what it ordered.
* ''Habeas corpus ad prosequendum'': a writ ordering return with a prisoner for the purpose of "prosecuting" him before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad respondendum'': a writ ordering return to allow the prisoner to "answer" to new proceedings before the court.
* ''Habeas corpus ad testificandum'': a writ ordering return with the body of a prisoner for the purposes of "testifying".

==Origins in England==
{{further|English law}}
''Habeas corpus'' originally stems from the [[Assize of Clarendon]], a re-issuance of rights during the reign of [[Henry II of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title=Assize of Clarendon, 1166. |date=1 December 1998 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the foundations for ''habeas corpus'' were "wrongly thought" to have originated in [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ralph V. ''Magna Carta'' Pearson (2003) p162 and p219&lt;/ref&gt; This charter declared that:{{quote|No [[Estates of the realm|Freeman]] shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his [[Freehold (law)|Freehold]], or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the land.}}

[[William Blackstone]] cites the first recorded usage of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' in 1305, during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]. However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying "[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous law (the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]]) had been passed forty years earlier to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Maxwell. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/canbarev18&amp;div=24 Habeas Corpus Cum Causa-The Emergence of the Modern Writ-II.] Can. B. Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone purpose of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s authority &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.

Then, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). "The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar", pp.85–86. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: "The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it".&lt;ref&gt;George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qEkmTPatLoesOPHBiM0F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it.&amp;f=false Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756–1816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.

The privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106&lt;/ref&gt; The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==
===Australia===
The writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), "Habeas Corpus" (Federation Press)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]]. Some legal experts questioned the constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Human Rights Guide to Australia's Counter-Terrorism Laws|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/human-rights-guide-australias-counter-terrorism-laws|website=Australian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=13 April 2015|date=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOZ&gt;{{cite web|title=National security and anti-terrorism laws in Australia|url=http://www.thenewsmanual.net/Resources/medialaw_in_australia_06.html|website=The News Manual|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rix|first1=Mark|title=Australia's Anti-Terrorism Legislation - The national security state and the community legal sector.|journal=Research Online - University of Wollongong|date=2006|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=gsbpapers|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
''Habeas corpus'' rights are part of the British legal tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have been enshrined in the [[Constitution Act 1982]], under [[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Ten]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html |title=The Constitution Act, 1982; Part I, Section 10(c): Legal Rights |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This states that "Everyone has the right on arrest or detention&amp;nbsp;... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined by way of ''habeas corpus'' and to be released if the detention is not lawful".

Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the [[October Crisis]], during which the [[War Measures Act]] was invoked by the [[Governor General of Canada]] on the [[Advice (constitutional)|constitutional advice]] of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who had received a request from the [[Quebec]] Cabinet. The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]]. The writ was suspended for several years following the [[Battle of Fort Erie (1866)]] during the [[Fenian Rising]], though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee]] assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/033001/f2/033001-1402.7-e.pdf |title=The Fenians in Canada |author=David A. Wilson |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writ is available where there is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see ''May v Ferndale Institution'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=May v Ferndale Institution |link= |year=2005 |court=scc |num=82 |parallelcite=[2005] 3 SCR 809 |date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] the writ is largely unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this right has been exercised.

===France===
A fundamental human right in the "1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]]" drafted by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/marquis-de-lafayette|title=Marquis de Lafayette|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce the law.

"Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that 'No individual may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down.' ... The Constitution further states that 'No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle under the condition specified by law.' Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention. In particular, it states that 'anyone deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/france.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: France - Author - Nicole Atwill, Senior Foreign Law Specialist|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|date=2009|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate [[René Cassin]] produced the first draft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |title="A World Made New, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" de Mary Ann GLENDON - Author Emmanuel Decaux |publisher=Le Centre de recherche sur les droits de l'homme et le droit humanitaire, CRDH, Université Panthéon-Assas |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714114736/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article42 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: History of The Document |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin and the French team subsequently championed the ''habeas corpus'' provisions enshrined in the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/rene-cassin-and-human-rights-great-war-universal-declaration?format=HB |title=René Cassin and Human Rights: From the Great War to the Universal Declaration - Authors - Jay Winter, Antoine Prost |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany has constitutional guarantees against improper detention and these have been implemented in statutory law in a manner that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus.

Article 104, paragraph 1 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.

Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.

In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&amp;#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 [[Queen's Bench]] case of ''[[Ex Parte]] [[Proctor#Disciplinary functions|Daisy Hopkins]]'', wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released,&lt;ref&gt;''Exparte, Hopkins'' (Daisy) (1891) 56 JP 262; 61 LJQB 240&lt;/ref&gt; and that of ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'', in which an African slave whose master had moved to London was freed by action of the writ.

The Indian judiciary has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of ''[[locus standi]]'', so that if a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved on his behalf by any other person. The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].

The article guarantees that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase "produce the body".

Article 40.4.2° provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.

The full text of Article 40.4.2° is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}

The writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.

The relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that "The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.

The Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.

The power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.

===Italy===
The right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that "Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him".

As there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.

===Pakistan===
Issuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Philippines===
In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it".

In 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2017 at 10&amp;nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization. The declaration suspends the writ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/05/23/1703088/duterte-declares-martial-law-mindanao|title=Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao|accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed a law to have the same effect as ''habeas corpus'' in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally called "the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.

===Spain===
The present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that "A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.

Historically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestación'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].

===United States===
{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}
&lt;!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! --&gt;
The United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that "The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it".

The writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.

Presidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 – Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.

In 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Señorío de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed. 

The New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Crown of Aragon===
The [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestación de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; According to the right of ''manifestación'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed over to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced &lt;ref&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestación'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never take place.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestación were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestación'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestación'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to Aragon and used his aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestación right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest. 

The right of ''manifestación'' was codified in 1325 in the [[ Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]]&lt;ref&gt;González Antón, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librería General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol I. Texto]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04151-9}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=FVbKFaPne8sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol. II. Documentos]. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04177-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en España (2ª edición). Barcelona: Crítica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
In 1430, King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland granted the Privilege of [[Jedlnia]], which proclaimed, ''[[Neminem captivabimus]] nisi iure victum'' ("We will not imprison anyone except if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H. Cole, Indiana University School of Law, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman-Dutch law===
In [[South Africa]] and other countries whose legal systems are based on [[Roman-Dutch law]], the ''[[interdictum de homine libero exhibendo]]'' is the equivalent of the writ of ''habeas corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murdoch |last=Watney |title=Arrest, detention and the ''interdictum de homine libero exhibendo'' |journal=Journal of South African Law |volume=2011 |year=2011 |number=3 |pages=555–562 |url=http://reference.sabinet.co.za/webx/access/electronic_journals/ju_tsar/ju_tsar_2011_n3_a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it has been entrenched in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], which provides in section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention is unlawful, to be released.

==World ''habeas corpus''==
In the 1950s, American lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] began advocating an international writ of ''habeas corpus'' to protect individual human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;The petition was titled "United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, Petitioner, v. Czechoslovakia, Respondent - Petition of Luis Kutner For and on Behalf of William N. Oatis, For a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus." See [http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf Vicki C. Jackson, "World Habeas Corpus", 91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309 (January 2006).] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleging that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and that the [[United Nations General Assembly]] had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human rights violations, the petition was filed with the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/03/Jacksonfinal.pdf|format=PDF|first=Vicki C. |last=Jackson|title=World Habeas Corpus |volume=91 Cornell Law Review 303, 309-314 |year=January 2006|website=cornelllawreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, but no other United Nations action was taken.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; Oatis was released in 1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;ref&gt;His first article was "A Proposal for a United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus and International Court of Human Rights", Tulane Law Review, 28 (June 1954): 417-441. See also, Luis Kutner, ''World Habeas Corpus'', Dobbs Ferry, NY: Oceana, 1962, p. 266, for his draft of a "Treaty-Statute of the International Court of Habeas Corpus".&lt;/ref&gt;

==International human rights standards==
Article 3 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides that "everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person". [[Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] goes further and calls for persons detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 5.4: {{quote|Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.}}

[[Image:Johann Jakob Moser.jpg|thumb|Johann Jacob Moser, after a painting by Johann Georg Oechslin (1775).]]

'''Johann Jakob Moser''' (18 January 1701 – 30 September 1785) was a German jurist, publicist and researcher, whose work earned him the title "The Father of German [[Constitutional Law]]" and whose political commitment to the principles of Liberalism caused him to lose academic positions and spend years as a [[political prisoner]].

==Early life==
Johann Jacob Moser was a member of the Moser family of Filseck, an old and respectable Württemberg family. They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser's father was Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck (born 1660 in Stuttgart, died 1716), and his mother was Helene Catharine ''née'' Misler (born 1672 in Stade, died 1741 in Stuttgart).

Moser was born and died in [[Stuttgart]]. He had six brothers and sisters but his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career. After attending [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wojak | first =Irmtrud | title =Fritz Bauer 1903–1968: eine Biographie | publisher=C.H.Beck | year =2009 | location =Munich | pages =54 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jP0uMZLuN0wC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Berthold+Auerbach%22+Eberhard-Ludwigs-gymnasium| isbn =978-3-406-58154-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moser studied state journalism at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He was mostly self-taught and at 18 years of age he became a professor of the law faculty. However he found his income insufficient, and he so that it had to look around for other possibilities. he studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], and was brilliant enough to be already at the age of 19 appointed a professor of Law in the same university.

In 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.

From 1721-1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was appointed as a "state adviser" in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The job conflicted with his role as a government advisor and he quit (which job?) in 1732. He held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.

In 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.

He spent the years 1739 to 1747 at [[Ebersdorf, Saalburg-Ebersdorf|Ebersdorf]], mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his ''Deutsches Staatsrecht'' ("German Constitutional Law"), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.

In 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]]. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke's [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress [[Hohentwiel]], on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in god unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.

In 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of [[Friedrich the Great]] of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.

==Legacy==
Johann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655-1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.

Apart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.

Among his important later works can be mentioned ''Neues deutsches Staatsrecht'', ("New German Constitutional Law"), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as [[theology]].

[[File:CourtGavel.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Philosopher]]s of law ask "what is law, and what should it be?"]]

'''Jurisprudence''' or '''legal theory''' is the theoretical study of [[law]], principally by [[philosophy of law|philosophers]] but, from the twentieth century, also by [[social science|social scientists]]. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as [[jurist]]s or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of [[Reason#Logical reasoning methods and argumentation|legal reasoning]], [[list of national legal systems|legal systems]], [[Law#Legal institutions|legal institutions]], and the role of law in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisprudence|title=Jurisprudence|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the [[natural law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and the [[Public international law|law of nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=0-314-19949-7|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.&lt;ref name="Shiner"&gt;Shiner, "Philosophy of Law", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient [[#Natural law|natural law]], as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have.&lt;ref name="Shiner" /&gt; Secondly, 'clarificatory' or [[#Analytic jurisprudence|analytic jurisprudence]] rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"/&gt; It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, ''legal positivism'', holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts.&lt;ref name="Soper_CDoP"&gt;Soper, "Legal Positivism", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; And ''legal realism'' argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, [[#Normative jurisprudence|normative jurisprudence]] is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question "What is law?", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.

== Etymology ==
The English word is based on the Latin maxim ''jurisprudentia'': ''juris'' is the [[genitive]] form of ''jus'' meaning "law", and ''prudentia'' means "prudence" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the word ''prudence'' had the meaning of "knowledge of or skill in a matter". The word may have come via the French ''jurisprudence'', which is attested earlier.

Ancient Indian jurisprudence is available in various [[Dharmaśāstra]] texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mmak/resent_article/JusticeKatjusLec.pdf|title=ANCIENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE|first=Markandey|last=Katju|year=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence already had this meaning{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in [[Ancient Rome]] even if at its origins the discipline was a (''periti'') in the ''[[Ius|jus]]'' of ''[[mos maiorum]]'' (traditional law), a body of [[oral law]]s and customs verbally transmitted "by father to son". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.

Their sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive ''Institutiones'' (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of ''prudentes''. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and [[Sabinians]]. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.

After the 3rd century, ''Juris prudentia'' became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was born.

=={{Anchor|Natural law}}Natural law==
In its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.

Another approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.
# '''The Strong Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it is not properly called a "law" at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: ''[[Lex iniusta non est lex|lex iniusta non est lex']] (an unjust law is no law at all).'' 
# '''The Weak Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it can still be called a "law", but it must be recognised as a defective law. 
Notions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that "an unjust law is no law at all", but as [[John Finnis]], the most important of modern natural barristers{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical [[Thomism|Thomist]] position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of [[justice]], beginning in the West with [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]].

===Aristotle===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]], by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Like his philosophical forefathers [[Socrates]] and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαίον φυσικόν'', [[Latin]] ''[[ius naturale]]''). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (= Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages,&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Loeb Classical Library; J. A. K. Thomson, trans. (revised by Hugh Tedennick), ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; though more recent translations render them more literally.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sachs, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Focus Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls "political justice" derives from his discussion of "the just" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics" Bk. II ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Irwin, trans. ''Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd Ed.'', Hackett Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them "just" in the sense of "general justice;" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics", Bk. V, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; "Particular" or "partial justice", by contrast, is the part of "general justice" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law," 75–81&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the most influential Western medieval legal [[scholar]]]]
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Thomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as "Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis". He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best known is the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. One of the thirty-five [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God's plan for the universe. Man needs this, for without it he would totally lack direction.
* Natural law is the "participation" in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason.
* [[Divine law]] is revealed in the scriptures and is God's positive law for mankind.
* [[Human law]] is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pojman]], ''Ethics'' ([[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[California|CA]]: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural law, of course, is based on "first principles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...&amp;nbsp;this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca|ius gentium}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text ''De iure belli ac pacis'' by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, p. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Suárez]], regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished ''ius inter gentes'' from ''ius intra gentes''. ''Ius inter gentes'' (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
In his treatise ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, (1651)]]'', Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a [[social contract]]arian&lt;ref&gt;Basically meaning: the people of a society are prepared give up some rights to a government in order to receive social order.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a [[state of nature]] to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The [[English Civil War]] and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

===Lon Fuller===
{{Main|Lon L. Fuller}}
Writing after [[World War II]], Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.

===John Finnis===
{{Main|John Finnis}}
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other "side". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.

=={{Anchor|Analytic jurisprudence}}Analytic jurisprudence==
{{Main|Analytic jurisprudence}}

Analytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"&gt;See H L A Hart, 'Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals' (1958) 71 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 593&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ Etext] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820100015/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people invariably slip between describing that the world ''is'' a certain way to saying therefore we ''ought'' to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ''ought'' to do something merely because something ''is'' the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world ''is'' must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative ''ought'' questions.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "What are laws?"; "What is ''the'' law?"; "What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?"; and "What is the relationship between law and morality?" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical School===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'' (Abraham A. Hayward trans., 1831)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.

===Sociological Jurisprudence===
{{Main|Sociology of Law}}
The effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, [[Hermann Kantorowicz]] and [[Eugen Ehrlich]]) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where [[Roscoe Pound]], for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, [[Julius Stone]] strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.

===Legal positivism===
{{Main|Legal positivism}}
Positivism simply means that law is something that is "posited": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is ''just'' by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.
* What the law ''is'' ([[lex lata]]) - is determined by historical social practice (resulting in rules)
* What the law ''ought to be'' ([[lex ferenda]]) - is determined by moral considerations.

====Bentham and Austin====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the twentieth century]]
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham|John Austin (legal philosopher)}}
One of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for [[democracy]], and strong [[atheist]]. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. Austin was the first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer to "what is law?" was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;John Austin, ''The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.

====Hans Kelsen====
{{Main|Hans Kelsen}}
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His [[Pure Theory of Law]] aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm ([[Grundnorm]])'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
{{Main|H. L. A. Hart}}
In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the professor of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.

Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The "rule of recognition" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |title=The University of Edinburgh |access-date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221401/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |archive-date=1 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published ''Institutions of Law'', 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and [[Joseph Raz]].

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called ''exclusive legal positivism'', and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled ''inclusive legal positivism'', a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.

====Joseph Raz====
{{Main|Joseph Raz}}
Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

Joseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal realism===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was a self-styled legal realist]]
{{Main|Legal realism}}
Legal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]] and Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]]). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Jurisprudence". West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Ed. Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle
Phelps. Detroit: Thomson/Gale, 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of [[Axel Hägerström]].

Despite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including [[critical legal studies]], [[feminist legal theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295–360''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical legal studies====
[[Critical legal studies]] are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5. See [http://ojls.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/1.extract]. DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, "Critical Legal Studies", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical rationalism===
[[Karl Popper]] originated the theory of [[Jurisprudence#critical rationalism|critical rationalism]]. According to [[Reinhold Zippelius]] many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, "daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011 Vorwort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal interpretivism===
{{Main|Interpretivism (legal)}}

Contemporary philosopher of law [[Ronald Dworkin]] has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, "Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin", ''Modern Law Review'', vol. 69 no. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin attacked [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no-one'' in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin's ''integrity theory of law'', has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''. But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
{{Main|Therapeutic jurisprudence}}

Consequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. [[Therapeutic jurisprudence]] ("TJ") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses [[social science]] methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Normative jurisprudence}}Normative jurisprudence==
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

In addition to the question, "What is law?", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or "evaluative" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to [[sanctions (law)|punishment]], and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.

===Virtue jurisprudence===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
{{Main|Virtue jurisprudence}}
Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
Deontology is "the theory of duty or moral obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for [[Utilitarianism (book)|utilitarian]] philosophy through the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ Utilitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505231025/http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ |date=5 May 2007 }} at Metalibri Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls|A Theory of Justice}}
John Rawls was an [[United States|American]] philosopher, a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and [[libertarian theories of law]].

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic depicting the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The shield is topped by a fortress.|The flag of Beirut features an open book with the motto "Berytus Nutrix Legum" (Beirut, Mother of Laws) on one side and its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation "بيروت أم الشرائع " on the other.]]
The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawmaking''' is the process of crafting legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lawmaking|title=Lawmaking definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its purest sense, it is the basis of [[governance]].  
This form of law making is also applied in India. It is a process which works in India on the basis of Indian Constitution.
Lawmaking in modern [[democracy|democracies]] is the work of [[legislature]]s, which exist at the local, regional, and national levels and make such laws as are appropriate to their level, and binding over those under their jurisdictions.  These bodies are influenced by [[lobbyist]]s, [[pressure group]]s, sometimes partisan considerations, but ultimately by the voters who elected them and to which they are responsible, if the system is working as intended.  Even the expenditure of governmental funds is an aspect of lawmaking, as in most jurisdictions the [[budget]] is a matter of law.

In [[dictator|dictatorships]] and absolute [[monarchy|monarchies]] the leader can make law essentially by the stroke of a pen, one of the main objections to such an arrangement.  However, a seemingly-analogous event can occur even in a democracy where the [[executive (government)|executive]] can make [[executive order]]s which have the force of law.  In some instance, even regulations issued by executive departments can have the force of law.  [[Libertarian]]s, in particular, are known for denouncing such actions as being anti-democratic, but they have become such a salient feature of modern governance that it is hard to picture a system in which they no longer exist, because it is hard to picture the time involved in every regulation being debated prior to becoming law.  That, say libertarians, is precisely the point: if such executive orders and regulations do not stand up to legislative scrutiny, they should never be implemented.  In response to this, limits on regulatory authority have been made legislatively, and libertarians still contend for, if not the abolition of executive orders altogether, then their automatic [[sunset]] after a fixed period if not legislatively reviewed and confirmed; this policy has been adopted in some jurisdictions.

'''Lawtel''' is a subscription-based online [[legal research]] tool that provides subscribers with access to a range of legal information. Used primarily by solicitors, barristers and legal researchers, it covers cases and judgments, legislation, articles and press cuttings, and online precedents. 

One of the most popular Lawtel services is Daily Updates. Subscribers choose from 100 subject areas to receive the latest news pertinent to their practice area. 

Lawtel provides same day reporting for the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] and overnight coverage of selected cases from the higher courts.

== History ==

Lawtel was created in 1980 by a Liverpool solicitor, Graham Ross, and demonstrated at the second annual conference of the Society for Computers and Law, where he was a speaker. Subsequently that year he was joined by a retired  barrister, Gerald Impey. Together they set up a [[Manx law|Manx company]] 'Lawtel Limited', from which Ross resigned a year later. Impey stayed on in various roles until his death in November 1999. In 1994, Lawtel was acquired by [[Centaur Communications|Centaur Communications Ltd]]. 

In 2002, Lawtel was acquired by [[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]].  Lawtel continues to remain a separate service within the Sweet &amp; Maxwell portfolio, positioned as a companion service to [[Westlaw]]. Currently Lawtel has 90000 subscribers, ranging from sole practitioners to universities and corporations.

== Lawtel In Detail ==

The Lawtel service is divided up into sections: cases, legislation, articles and press, and specialist areas. 
Subscribers have access to around 60,000 case reports and the service is updated daily. Cases are reported from the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Civil), [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Criminal), [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], selected tribunals, [[Crown Court]], and the [[County Court]].

Lawtel allows subscribers to track the progress of a piece of legislation, and search for legislation that has already become law.

It offers a full text document delivery service for judgments dating back to 1980. Subscribers can read unofficial transcripts and track specific cases. It also delivers updates on legislation and cases to a subscriber’s inbox, via the Daily Updates service.

Lawtel also offers services for specific practice areas. These include: The Busy Solicitor’s Digest, EU, FirstPoint, Employment, Human Rights, Lawtel Litigator, Local Government, Kemp on Lawtel, and Personal Injury.

== The Impact of Lawtel on Legal Publishing in the UK ==

Laurence Eastham, Editor of the [http://www.scl.org Society of Computers and Law] journal C&amp;L, commented upon the sale of Lawtel to Sweet &amp; Maxwell that:

''"Lawtel undoubtedly made others improve, and move more rapidly than might otherwise have been natural to them. A large number of practising solicitors have been recruited to the need for updated online information by Lawtel... [i]n  short, they made a difference"'' C&amp;L August/September 2002, p.2

'''[[Law]] in [[Asia]]''' is undergoing rapid change and modernisation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, especially given the economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]]. Asian countries share a substantial heritage with European law{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, whilst keeping their own distinct identity.

==History==
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Libertarian anarchism''' may refer to:
* [[Anarchism]], a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies, usually considered a radical left-wing ideology
* [[Autarchism]], a political philosophy that upholds the principle of individual liberty, rejects compulsory government and supports the elimination of government in favor of ruling oneself and no other
* [[Free-market anarchism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets
** [[Agorism]], a revolutionary form of free-market anarchism that focuses on employing counter-economic activity to undermine the state
** [[Anarcho-capitalism]], a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property and open markets (many anarchists dispute this as a form of anarchism and argue it is a misuse of the term)
** [[Left-wing market anarchism]], a political philosophy that strongly affirms the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support "anti-capitalist" positions
* [[Libertarianism]], an individualist political philosophy that upholds liberty as its primary focus and principal objective
* [[Voluntaryism]], a political philosophy which holds that all forms of human association should be voluntary

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

[[A First Book of English Law]]. Seventh Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. London. 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-421-23030-9}}. Page 172.&lt;/ref&gt; is a legal term from [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions referring to the various published collections of reports of [[English law|English cases]] in various courts from the Middle Ages to the 1860s, when law reporting was officially taken over by the [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]], for example [[Edmund F. Moore]]'s ''Reports of Cases Heard and Determined by the Judicial Committee and the Lords of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council on Appeal from the Supreme and Sudder Dewanny Courts in the East Indies'' published in London from 1837 to 1873, referred to as ''[[Moore's Indian Appeals]]'' and cited for example as: ''Moofti Mohummud Ubdoollah'' v. ''Baboo Mootechund'' 1 M.I.A. 383.

Most (but not all) are reprinted in the [[English Reports]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]], Learning the Law, 11th Edition, 1982, Stevens, p.34; 13th Edition, 2006, Sweet and Maxwell, p.36 (less clear)&lt;/ref&gt;

They are described as "nominate" in order to distinguish them from the [[Year Books]], which are anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, Adrian. In R G Logan (editor). [[Information Sources in Law]]. Butterworths. London. 1986. p 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandectists''' were German university legal scholars in the early 19th century who studied and taught [[Roman law]] as a model of what they called [[Konstruktionsjurisprudenz]] ([[conceptual jurisprudence]]) as codified in the [[Pandects]] of [[Justinian]] (Berman).

Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Pandectists were attacked in arguments by noted jurists [[Julius Hermann von Kirchmann]] and [[Rudolf von Jhering]] who favored a modern approach of law as a practical means to an end (Weber).

In the United States, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] and other legal realists pushed for laws based on what judges and the courts actually did, rather than the historical and conceptual or academic law of [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and the Pandectists (Rosenberg).

The '''Philip Morris v. Uruguay case'''  ({{lang-es|'''Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay'''}}) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational [[tobacco company]] [[Philip Morris International]] filed a complaint against [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |title = Philip Morris versus Uruguay |author = El Espectador |date = 9 March 2010 |accessdate = 15 November 2010 |language = Spanish |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160056/http://www.espectador.com/1v4_contenido.php?id=176011&amp;sts=1 |archivedate = 14 March 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The company complains that Uruguay's [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]] devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the [[bilateral investment treaty]] between Switzerland and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; (Philip Morris is headquartered in [[Lausanne]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmi.com/marketpages/pages/market_en_ch.aspx | title =Philip Morris International Management SA - Switzerland Operations Centre | author = [[Philip Morris International|PMI]] | accessdate = 15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding [[arbitration]] before the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | title=Uruguay Wins Dispute With Tobacco Giant Philip Morris | work=ABC News | date=8 July 2016 | author=AP | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709143704/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uruguay-wins-dispute-tobacco-giant-philip-morris-40448855 | archive-date=2016-07-09 | access-date=23 October 2016 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uruguay had received accolades from the [[World Health Organization]] and from anti-smoking activists for its [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/208683/cigarrillos-mentolados-aumentan-la-adiccion/|title = Cigarrillos mentolados aumentan la adicción|author = El Observador |date = 6 September 2011|accessdate =13 September 2011 |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016, after 6 years, the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the expenses of the defendants and the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html |title =Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-36752509|title =Histórico fallo a favor de Uruguay en el juicio contra la tabacalera Philip Morris|author =BCC |language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/esta-es-la-historia-de-uruguay-david-contra-philip-morris-goliath.html |title =Esta es la historia de Uruguay (David) contra Philip Morris (Goliath) |author =elfinanciero|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2003, when the Uruguayan President was [[Jorge Batlle]], the [[General Assembly of Uruguay]] approved the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], an agreement whereby Policies recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] were implemented.

In 2006, Uruguay under President [[Tabaré Vázquez]], an [[oncologist]] by profession, began to enact comprehensive [[smoking ban|anti-smoking legislation]].
On 1 March 2006, Uruguay became the first country in [[Latin America]] to prohibit smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/461696-uruguay-cree-que-philip-morris-incumplio-pasos-previos-a-la-demanda| title = Uruguay cree que Philip Morris incumplió pasos previos a la demanda |author =LR21| date =9 July 2011|accessdate =4 August 2011|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the legislature approved Law 18.256 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|title = Ley Nº 18.256 Control del Tabaquismo|author = Uruguay Legislature|date = 6 March 2008|accessdate = 10 March 2009|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416104642/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18256&amp;Anchor|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes six strategies of anti-smoking policy.

Some of the measures by the government were the ban on selling different types of presentations of the same brand of cigarettes, the dissemination of images warning about the risks of smoking and covering at least 80% of the cigarette pack, raising of taxes, banning cigarette advertising in the media, and banning sponsorship of sports events. In addition, smoking was banned in public places such as offices, student centers, bars, restaurants, dances and public places, among others.

The smokefree campaign "Libre de Humo de Tabaco" was gradually implemented by the "Ministerio de Salud Pública del Uruguay" ([[List of Ministers for Public Health (Uruguay)|Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|title = Campaña "Libre de Humo de Tabaco"|author = MSP|accessdate = 15 November 2010|language = Spanish|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615005816/http://www.msp.gub.uy/uc_546_1.html|archivedate = 15 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==

[[Philip Morris International]] is a multinational company, a leading producer of cigarettes, of which it owns seven out of twenty global brands.

The tobacco company initiated a claim in the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (ICSID), a part of the [[World Bank]] seeking $25 million in compensation from Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Alfred-Maurice de Zayas]]|title=How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/16/philip-morris-uruguay-tobacco-isds-human-rights|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2016|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that forum, an arbitration tribunal was formed with one arbitrator appointed by each party and a third arbitrator elected by the arbitrators appointed by the parties. The plaintiffs are FTR Holding SA (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products SA (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos SA (PMI representative in Uruguay) against Uruguay (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet|title = ICSID - Case Details|author = [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|ICSID]]|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate =17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip Morris has filed similar cases against [[Norway]] and [[Australia]].

== Decision == 
On 2 July 2013, the tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw1531.pdf |title =Decision on Jurisdiction |date=4 July 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution of the case, which affected international&amp;nbsp;[[jurisprudence]], took 6 years; the case ended on 8 July 2016. The [[World Bank]] [ICSID] ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the costs of the defendants and the court.
The final report established that [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] had to pay 7 million [[dollars]] to the country for judicial expenses, in addition to paying different amounts for the fees and administrative expenses of the three arbitrators and the CADI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/fallo-favorable-uruguay-juicio-philip-morris.html|title = Philip Morris deberá pagar a Uruguay US$ 7 millones por gastos judiciales|author = [[El País (Uruguay)|El País]]|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Born]] emitted a discordant decision in two of the points of the judicial failure.

After its victory in the case, the government declared that from 2017 cigarettes in Uruguay will be sold in [[Plain tobacco packaging|generic packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elobservador.com.uy/a-partir-2017-los-cigarrillos-se-venderan-empaquetado-generico-n940912 |title =A partir de 2017 los cigarrillos se venderán en empaquetado genérico  |author= El Observador|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.teledoce.com/telemundo/nacionales/vazquez-anuncio-en-cadena-nacional-que-uruguay-gano-juicio-a-philips-morris/|title= Vázquez anunció en cadena nacional que Uruguay ganó juicio a Philips Morris|author = Canal 12|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/1302400-tabare-vazquez-aclaro-prohibicion-fumar-areas-publica-cerradas-incluye-marihuana |title = Drogas|author  = LR21|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

According to Enrico Bonadio, Senior Lecturer in Law at [[City University London]], the ruling in the case "may make it more difficult for tobacco companies to use lawsuits to produce a “[[chilling effect]]” and so discourage countries from introducing tobacco control policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/uruguays-victory-against-big-tobacco-is-more-than-just-a-local-triumph-62319|title=Uruguay's victory against Big Tobacco is more than just a local triumph|author= theconversation|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy of law''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]] that seeks to answer basic questions about [[law]] and [[legal system]]s, such as "What is law?", "What are the criteria for legal [[Validity (logic)|validity]]?", "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?", and many other similar questions.

==Analytical jurisprudence==
"The principal objective of [[analytical jurisprudence]] has traditionally been to provide an account of what distinguishes law as a system of norms from other systems of norms, such as ethical norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Law|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question that has received the most attention from philosophers of law is ''What is law?''  Several schools of thought have provided rival answers to this question, the most influential of which are:
*[[Natural law]] theory asserts that there are laws that are immanent in nature, to which enacted laws should correspond as closely as possible.  This view is frequently summarized by the maxim: an unjust law is not a true law, 'unjust' being defined as contrary to natural law.
*[[Legal positivism]] is the view that the law is defined by the social rules or practices that identify certain norms as laws.  One of the early positivists was in the early nineteenth century [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], who was influenced by the writings of Jeremy Bentham. Austin held that the law is the command of the sovereign backed by the threat of punishment. Contemporary legal positivism has long abandoned this view. In the twentieth century, two positivists had a profound influence on the philosophy of law. On the continent, Hans Kelsen was the most influential, where his notion of a "grundnorm" ultimate and basic legal norm, still retains some influence.  In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules.  Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, such as law, cannot be grounded in non-normative social facts.  According to Hart, law is essentially a system of primary social rules that guide the conduct of law's subjects, and secondary rules that regulate how the primary rules may be changed, how disputes about them are to be adjudicated and, especially, how the primary rules are to be identified. Hart argues that this last function is performed by a "rule of recognition", a customary practice of the officials (especially judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. Hart's theory, although widely admired, has also been criticized by a variety of late twentieth century philosophers of law, including his former student, Ronald Dworkin, John Rawls, Joseph Raz, and John Finnis.
*[[Legal realism]] was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers.{{who|date=March 2017}}{{when|date=March 2017}}  Skeptical in tone, it holds that the law should be understood as being determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises.  It has some affinities with the sociology of law.
*[[Interpretivism (legal)|Legal interpretivism]] is the view, espoused mainly by Ronald Dworkin in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', that law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal.  It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society.  It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no one'' in a society may know what its laws are (because no one may know the best justification of its practices.)

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained.  One important debate is within legal positivism.  One school is sometimes called "exclusive legal positivism", and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness.  A second school is labeled "inclusive legal positivism", and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.  Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).  In fact, it is even unclear whether Hart himself held this view in its broad form, for he insisted both that to be a legal system rules must have a certain minimum content, which content overlaps with moral concerns, and that it must attain at least some degree of justice in the administration of laws.

A second important debate in recent years concerns [[interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]], a view that is associated mainly with [[Ronald Dworkin]].  An interpretivist theory of law holds that legal rights and duties are determined by the best interpretation of the political practices of a particular community.  Interpretation, according to Dworkin's [[law as integrity]] theory, has two dimensions.  To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''.  But of those interpretations that fit, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''.  But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

==Normative jurisprudence==
In addition to analytic jurisprudence, legal philosophy is also concerned with normative theories of law.  "Normative jurisprudence involves normative, evaluative, and otherwise prescriptive questions about the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Law|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil/#H2|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, What is the goal or purpose of law?  What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law?  Three approaches have been influential in contemporary moral and political philosophy, and these approaches are reflected in normative theories of law:
* [[Utilitarianism]] is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences.  Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]].  In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the [[law and economics]] tradition.
* [[Deontology]] is the view that the laws should protect individual autonomy, liberty, or rights.  The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated a deontological theory of law (but not the only one possible).  A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]].
* Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality.  [[Virtue jurisprudence]] is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens.  Historically, this approach is associated with Aristotle.  Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.
There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including [[critical legal studies]] and [[libertarian theories of law]].

==Philosophical approaches to legal problems==

Philosophers of law are also concerned with a variety of philosophical problems that arise in particular legal subjects, such as [[constitutional law]], [[Contract]] law, [[Criminal law]], and [[Tort]] law. Thus, philosophy of law addresses such diverse topics as [[Contract theory|theories of contract law]], theories of criminal punishment, theories of tort liability, and the question of whether judicial review is justified.

==Definition==

Most [[literacy]] and communications scholars agree that plain language means:
* "Clear and effective communication" ([[Joseph Kimble]])
* "The idiomatic and grammatical use of language that most effectively presents ideas to the reader" ([[Bryan Garner]])
* "Clear, straightforward expression, using only as many words as are necessary. It is language that avoids obscurity, inflated vocabulary and convoluted construction. It is not baby talk, nor is it a simplified version of ... language." (Dr [[Robert Eagleson]])
* "A literary style that is easy-to-read because it matches the reading skill of the audience" ([[William DuBay]])
* "Language that is ''clear, concise'' and ''correct"'' ([[Richard Wydick]])

Plain language focuses on ways of writing a text so that it is clear, concise, pertinent, efficient, and flows well for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;About Plain Language. (n.d.).

==Guidelines and tips==

Writers who wish to write in plain language must first and foremost consider their target audience.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  This should have an influence on what information is included in the text and on how it is written.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  Different audiences have different needs, and require different information.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  When writing, it is important to consider what the target audience needs to accomplish, and what and how much information they need to complete it.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  The target audience will also affect the chosen vocabulary: writing for someone in the same field as the author is different than writing for someone for whom English is his or her second language.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"&gt;Public Works and Government Services Canada. (2014). 13 Plain Language. The Canadian Style. Retrieved from : http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chapsect13&amp;info0=13&lt;/ref&gt;

The text must be organized logically: the most important information should be mentioned first, in the text as a whole and in every individual paragraph.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Headings help the reader skim the text more rapidly to find what he or she is looking for.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  Sentences should be kept short, and only include the necessary information.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;  A long, verbose sentence tends to present too much information at once, and blurs its main point.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  The text should be direct and concise, and have an easy flow to it.&lt;ref name="centerforplainlanguage.org"/&gt;

The chosen vocabulary must remain simple and familiar.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Everyday language should be favoured against acronyms, jargon and legal language.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;  Plain language favours the use of the verb form of the word, instead of the noun form.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;  To enhance clarity, plain language privileges the active voice, in which the subject does the action of the verb.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Sentences written in plain language have a positive construction and address the reader directly.&lt;ref name="plainlanguagenetwork.org"/&gt;

Writing in plain language also takes into account the presentation of the text.  It is important to choose a font that is easy to read, and set it to an adequate size.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Sentences written in capital letters are harder to read because the letters are less distinguishable from one another.&lt;ref name="Government Services Canada 2014"/&gt;  Simple design elements like leaving white spaces, using bullets, and choosing contrasting colours encourages a user to read the text and makes it easier to read.&lt;ref name="btb.termiumplus.gc.ca"/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[Cicero]] argued, "When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men's minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind."{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Cicero writes that the plain style is not easy. While it may seem close to everyday speech, achieving the effect in formal discourse is a high and difficult art: "Plainness of style seems easy to imitate at first thought, but when attempted, nothing is more difficult."

Plainness does not mean the absence of all ornaments, only the more obvious ones. Cicero recognizes what [[Aristotle]] had already pointed out, that a well-turned [[metaphor]] or [[simile]] can help us see a relation we had not recognized. In fact, he makes use of metaphor and simile to teach us what the plain style is all about: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... although it is not full-blooded, it should nevertheless have some of the sap of life so that, though it lack great strength, it may be, so to speak, in sound health.... Just as some women are said to be handsomer when unadorned... so this plain style gives pleasure when unembellished.... All noticeable pearls, as it were, will be excluded. Not even curling irons will be used. All cosmetics, artificial white and red, will be rejected. Only elegance and neatness will remain. (The Orator, xxiii, 76-79)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shakespeare parodied the pretentious style, as in the speeches of Dogberry in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. 
The plain, or native style, was, in fact, an entire literary tradition during the English Renaissance, from [[John Skelton]] through [[Ben Jonson]] and include such poets as [[Barnabe Googe]], [[George Gascoigne]], [[Walter Raleigh]], and perhaps the later work of [[Fulke Greville]]. In addition to its purely linguistic plainness, the Plain Style employed an emphatic, pre-Petrarchan [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (each syllable either clearly stressed or clearly unstressed).

===19th century===
By the end of the 19th century, scholars began to study the features of plain language. A. L. Sherman, a professor of English literature at the University of Nebraska, wrote ''Analytics of Literature: A Manual for the Objective Study of English Prose and Poetry'' in 1893. In this work, Sherman showed that the typical English sentence has shortened over time and that spoken English is a pattern for written English.

Sherman wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Literary English, in short, will follow the forms of the standard spoken English from which it comes. No man should talk worse than he writes, no man writes better than he should talk.... The oral sentence is clearest because it is the product of millions of daily efforts to be clear and strong. It represents the work of the race for thousands of years in perfecting an effective instrument of communication.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1900 to 1950===
Two 1921 works, Harry Kitson's "The Mind of the Buyer", and [[Edward L. Thorndike]]'s "The Teacher's Word Book" picked up where Sherman left off. Kitson's work was the first to apply empirical psychology to advertising. He advised the use of short words and sentences. Thorndike's work contained the frequency ratings of 10,000 words. He recommended using the ratings in his book to grade books not only for students in schools but also for average readers and adults learning English. Thorndike wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is commonly assumed that children and adults prefer trashy stories in large measure because they are more exciting and more stimulating in respect to sex. There is, however, reason to believe that greater ease of reading in respect to vocabulary, construction, and facts, is a very important cause of preference. A count of the vocabulary of "best sellers" and a summary of it in terms of our list would thus be very instructive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1930s saw many studies on how to make texts more readable. In 1931, Douglas Tyler and Ralph Waples published the results of their two-year study, "What People Want to Read About". In 1934, Ralph Ojemann, [[Edgar Dale]], and Ralph Waples published two studies on writing for adults with limited reading ability. In 1935, educational psychologist [[William S. Gray]] teamed up with Bernice Leary to publish their study, "What Makes a Book Readable".

[[George Orwell]]'s 1946 essay "[[Politics and the English Language]]" decried the pretentious diction, meaninglessness, vagueness, and worn-out idioms of political jargon. In 1979, the [[Plain English Campaign]] was founded in London to combat "gobbledegook, jargon and legalese".&lt;ref&gt;Plain English Campaign. Retrieved August 16, 2011, from: http://www.plainenglish.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===1951 to 2000===
[[Lyman Bryson]] at Teachers College in Columbia University led efforts to supply average readers with more books of substance dealing with science and current events. Bryson's students include Irving Lorge and [[Rudolf Flesch]], who became leaders in the plain-language movement. In 1975, Flesch collaborated with [[J. Peter Kincaid]] to create the [[Flesch-Kincaid readability test]], which uses an algorithm to produce grade level scores that predict the level of education required to read the selected text.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkaid, J.P., Fishburne, R.P., R.L., &amp; Chissom, B.S. (1975). Derivation of New Readability Formulas (Automated Readability Index, Fog Count, and Flesch Reading Ease formula) for Navy Enlisted Personnel. Research Branch Report 8-75. Chief of Naval Technical Training: Naval Air Station Memphis.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument looks at word length (number of letters) and sentence length (number of words) and produces a score that is tied to a U.S. grade school level. For example, a score of 8.0 means that an eighth grader can read the document.

Others who later led plain language and readability research include educator Edgar Dale of Ohio State, Jeanne S. Chall of the Reading Laboratory of Harvard, and George R. Klare of Ohio University. Their efforts spurred the publication of over 200 readability formulas and 1,000 published studies on readability.

Beginning in 1935, a series of literacy surveys showed that the average reader in the U.S. was an adult of limited reading ability. Today, the average adult in the U.S. reads at the 9th-grade level.

Access to health information, educational and [[economic development]] opportunities, and government programs is often referred to in a social justice context. To ensure more community members can access this information, many adult educators, legal writers, and social program developers use plain language principles when they develop public documents{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. The goal of plain language translation is to increase accessibility for those with lower literacy levels.

In the United States, the movement towards plain language legal writing began with the 1963 book ''Language of the Law'', by David Mellinkoff.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=Johnson, Lori|date=2015|title=Say the Magic Word: A Rhetorical Analysis of Contract Drafting Choices|url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/897/|journal=Scholarly Commons @ UNLV Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movement was popularized by Richard Wydick’s 1979 book ''Plain English for Lawyers.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was followed by famous plain language [[Promissory note|promissory notes]] by Nationwide Mutual Insurance and Citibank in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kimble|first=Joseph|date=December 1992|title=Plain English: A Charter for Clear Writing|url=https://www.michbar.org/file/generalinfo/plainenglish/pdfs/92_dec.pdf|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about the large number of suits against its customers to collect bad debts, the bank voluntarily made the decision to implement plain language policies in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, M., (2003).

American [[law school]]s began requiring students to take legal writing classes that encouraged them to use plain English as much as possible and to avoid legal jargon, except when absolutely necessary.  Public outrage with the skyrocketing number of unreadable government forms led to the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]] of 1980.

In 1972, the Plain Language Movement received practical political application, when President [[Richard Nixon]] decreed that the "Federal Register be written in layman's terms". On March 23, 1978, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed Executive Order 12044, which said that federal officials must see that each regulation is "written in plain English and understandable to those who must comply with it".&lt;ref name=plainwriting&gt;

By 1991, eight states had also passed legislation related to plain language. Plain Language Association International (PLAIN) was formed in 1993 as the Plain Language Network. Its membership is international; it was incorporated as a non-profit organization in Canada in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About PLAIN |url=http://plainlanguagenetwork.org/networkindex.html |publisher=Plain Language Association International |accessdate=2008-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110220806/http://www.plainlanguagenetwork.org/networkindex.html |archivedate=2008-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by SEC Commissioner: Remarks at the Plain Language Association International's Fifth International Conference|publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]]|year=2005|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch110405cag.htm|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In June 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] issued a memorandum that called for executive departments and agencies to use plain language in all government documents.&lt;ref name=plainwriting/&gt; Vice President [[Al Gore]] subsequently spearheaded a plain language initiative that formed a group called the Plain Language Action Network (PLAIN) to provide plain language training to government agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Proximity of blood''', or '''proximity by degree''' of [[degree of kinship|kinship]], is one of the ways to determine [[Hereditary title|hereditary]] [[Order of succession|succession]] based on [[genealogy]]. In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the [[per stirpes|right of representation]], a component of [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}}

In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, it is called the "ancient custom" ({{lang-fr|ancienne coutume}}) in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], where a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

== Examples ==
Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes.

===Successful applications===
*When [[Richard the Lionheart]] died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, [[John, King of England|John]], and his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] (the son of his second brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]]). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed.{{sfn|Barlow|1999|p=305}}

*[[Alfonso X of Castile]] wished to enforce primogeniture by the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to [[Alfonso de la Cerda|Alfonso]], the son of his deceased eldest son, [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Ferdinand]]. His second but eldest surviving son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship.{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1975|p=831}}

*In 1307 a dispute erupted over the [[County of Artois]] between [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois|Mahaut]], who had succeeded her father, [[Robert II, Count of Artois|Robert II]], in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, [[Robert III of Artois|Robert]]. Robert II had outlived his son, [[Philip of Artois|Philip]], and Mahaut put herself forward as "the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on "representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim.{{sfn|Wood|1966|p=60}}

*[[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy|Odo IV]], having outlived his son [[Philip I, Count of Auvergne|Philip]], decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, [[Joan the Lame|Joan]], rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}} Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of Odo's older sister [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by [[John II of France]], son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

*During the reign of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]], or his nephew, [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]] (the son of his deceased elder sister, [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Hedwig Sophia]]).{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=132, 393}} The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=371}} Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=}}

=== Unsuccessful applications ===

*In 1269, upon the death of [[Conrad III of Jerusalem]], [[Mary of Antioch]] and [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of [[Melisende of Lusignan|Melisende]], fifth daughter of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], while he was the grandson of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice]], second daughter of Isabella I. Mary the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the [[kings of Jerusalem]], while Hugh had precedence by [[primogeniture]] but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=328-329}}

*[[Alexander III of Scotland]] drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children.{{sfn|Duncan|2002|p=166-169}} Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], in 1290, the succession was [[Great Cause|unclear]]. [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert de Brus]] claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the [[kings of Scotland]],{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}} while [[John Balliol]] made a claim based on primogeniture.{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Robert and John were both descended from [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David of Huntingdon]] (grandson of [[David I of Scotland]]); Robert was a grandson (son of [[Isobel of Huntingdon|Isobel]], second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]], first daughter of David of Huntingdon).{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Arbitration by [[Edward I of England]] awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as [[Robert I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}}

'''Public interest''' is "the [[welfare]] or [[well-being]] of the [[general public]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415664660/ Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

{{globalize|date=February 2017}}

Public interest has been considered as the core of "[[democratic theories of government]]” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

Stanford Law Review Vol. 54, No. 4, Apr., 2002, p. 737-7520&lt;/ref&gt; '''purposive construction''',&lt;ref&gt;Bourchard, Ron A.

Purposive interpretation is a derivation of [[mischief rule]] set in ''[[Heydon's Case]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bennion, F.A.R. ''Statutory Interpretation''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (London) 3d ed., 1997, p. 731-750&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to replace the mischief rule, the [[plain meaning rule]] and the [[golden rule (law)|golden rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Driedger, E.A. ''Construction of Statutes''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (Canada) Ltd., 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Purposive interpretation is used when the courts use extraneous materials from the pre-enactment phase of legislation, including early drafts, [[hansard]]s, committee reports, and white papers. The purposive interpretation involves a rejection of the [[exclusionary rule]].

Israeli jurist [[Aharon Barak]] views purposive interpretation as a legal construction that combines elements of the subjective and objective.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Aharon. ''Purposive Interpretation In Law''. Princeton University Press (New Jersey), 2005, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Barak states that the subjective elements include the intention of the author of the text, whereas the objective elements include the intent of the reasonable author and the legal system’s fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Aharon. ''Purposive Interpretation In Law''. Princeton University Press (New Jersey), 2005, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of purposivism argue it fails to separate the powers between the legislator and the judiciary,&lt;ref&gt;Amy E.  Fahey, Note, United States v. O’Hagan: The Supreme Court Abandons Textualism to Adopt the Misappropriation Theory, 25 FORDHAM URB. L.J. 507, 534 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; as it allows more freedom in interpretation by way of extraneous materials in interpreting the law.

==Historical origins==

===Plain meaning rule===

The plain meaning rule gained popularity during the 18th and 19th centuries as the courts took an increasingly strict view of the words within statutes. Under the plain meaning rule, the words of the statute are given their natural or ordinary meaning. The plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation should be the first rule applied by judges.

One of the leading statements of the plain meaning rule was made by Chief Justice [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] in the [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1844/822.pdf ''[[Royal Marriages Act 1772|Sussex Peerage]]'' ] (1844) {{cquote|… the only rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is, that they should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the Act. If the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver.}}

Strict application of the plain meaning rule can sometime result in "absurd" outcomes. Examples of the plain meaning rule producing absurd outcomes can be seen in the following cases:

* In ''Whitely v Chappel'' (1868) a statute made it an offence "to impersonate any person entitled to vote". The defendant used the vote of a dead man. The statute relating to voting rights required a person to be living in order to be entitled to vote. The plain meaning rule was applied and the defendant was thus acquitted.
* In [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1836/847.pdf ''R v Harris''] (1836) the defendant had bit off his victim's nose. But because the statute made it an offence "to stab cut or wound" the court held that under the plain meaning rule the act of biting did not come within the meaning of stab cut or wound as these words implied an instrument had to be used. The defendant’s conviction was overturned.
* In ''Fisher v Bell'' (1961) the [[Knife legislation#Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959|Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1958]] made it an offence to “offer for sale” an offensive weapon. The defendant had a flick knife displayed in his shop window with a price tag on it. Statute made it a criminal offence to "offer" such flick knives for sale. His conviction was overturned as goods on display in shops are not "offers" in the technical sense but an [[invitation to treat]]. The court applied the plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation.

===Golden rule===

The golden rule permits the courts to depart from the plain meaning rule if the meaning leads to consequences it considers to be absurd or ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Driedger, E.A. ''Construction of Statutes''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (Canada) Ltd., 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  This was propounded in [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1857/335.pdf ''Grey v Pearson'' ] (1857) where [[James Parke, 1st Baron Wensleydale|Lord Wensleydale]] stated

{{cquote|In construing… statutes… the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid the absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.&lt;ref&gt;Grey v Pearson (1857) 6 HLC 61, 106 per Lord Wensleydale&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The degree of absurdity or ambiguity necessary to exercise the golden rule is determined on a case by case basis by the individual judge in question.  There are two general situations in which the golden rule may be employed: narrowly, to take the 'better' reading of two alternatives, or more widely, to broaden a rule that, although unambiguous, leads to an absurd outcome.

The case ''Maddox v Storer [1963] 1 Q.B. 451'' is typical of the more narrow use.  In ''Maddox'', the defender had been travelling at over the 30&amp;nbsp;mph speed limit in a minibus with eleven seats (excluding that of the driver), most of which were unoccupied.  Per [[Road Traffic Act 1960]] travelling at over 30&amp;nbsp;mph in a vehicle ‘adapted to carry more than seven passengers’ was an offence.  It was held that ''adapted to'' could be taken to mean ''suitable for''.

The court applies the golden rule in a wider sense in ''Adler v George'' (1964). Under the [[Official Secrets Act 1920]] it was an offence to obstruct a member of the armed forces 'in the vicinity' of a prohibited place. The defendant was actually in the prohibited place, rather than "in the vicinity" of it, at the time of obstruction. The courts had to determine whether “in [the] vicinity of” included on/in the premises. The court applied the golden rule. The court said that in the vicinity did include on or in as well. It would be absurd for a person to be liable if they were near to a prohibited place and not if they were actually in it. The defendant’s conviction was therefore upheld.

In ''Re Sigsworth'' (1935), a son had murdered his mother.  Under slayer or forfeiture rules of long standing in the United Kingdom, he would have been excluded as beneficiary under her will.  She had, however, died intestate, and the Administration of Justice Act 1925 provided that her next of kin would inherit.  Although the situation was unambiguous, the absurdity inherent in such a situation meant that forfeiture had to be treated as applicable to intestacy rules taking the place of a will as well as wills themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://swarb.co.uk/re-sigsworth-bedford-v-bedford-1935/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mischief rule===
In ''Construction of Statutes'', [[Elmer Driedger]] defines the [[mischief rule]] as follows: 
{{cquote|A statute is to be so construed as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, thus giving the courts considerable latitude in achieving the objective of the legislature despite any inadequacy in the language employed by it.&lt;ref&gt;Driedger, E.A. ''Construction of Statutes''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (Canada) Ltd., 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; }}
 
''Heydon's Case'' (1584) laid out the following statement of the principles underlying what would come to be called the "mischief rule":
&lt;!-- I wish there was a way to override HTML ordered list labels with "1st", "2nd", etc. but it looks like
the following table-based construction is the best I can do. --&gt;
{{cquote|1=For the sure and true interpretation of all statutes four things are to be discerned and considered:-
{{(!}}
{{!-}} style="vertical-align: top;"
{{!}}align=right{{!}}1st.{{!!}}What was the common law before the making of the Act.
{{!-}} style="vertical-align: top;"

''Construction of Statutes''. Butterworth &amp; Co. (Canada) Ltd., 1983, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
{{!)}}
}}

The mischief rule saw further development in ''Corkery v Carpenter'' (1951). In a decision of 
the Court of King’s Bench, the Court had to decide whether a bicycle could be classified as a carriage. According to S.12 of the [[Licensing Act 1872]], a person found drunk in charge of a carriage on the highway can be arrested without a warrant. A man was arrested drunk in charge of a bicycle. According to the plain meaning rule a bike is not a carriage. Under the Mischief rule the bicycle could constitute a carriage. The mischief the act was attempting to remedy was that of people being on the road on transport while drunk. Therefore a bicycle could be classified as a carriage.

In ''Smith v Hughes'' (1960), the defendant was charged under the Street Offences Act 1959 which made it an offence to solicit prostitution in a public place. The defendant was soliciting from within private premises (windows or on balconies) so they could be seen by the public without entering into the streets. The court applied the mischief rule holding that the activities of the defendant was within the mischief of the Act, and soliciting from within a house, is soliciting and molesting of the public. Therefore it is the same as if the defendant was outside on the street.

In ''Royal College of Nursing of the UK v DHSS'' (1981), the [[Royal College of Nursing]] brought an action challenging the legality of the involvement of nurses in carrying out [[abortion]]s. The [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]] made it an offence for any person to carry out an abortion. The [[Abortion Act 1967]] provides an absolute defence for a [[medical practitioner]] provided certain well-known conditions are satisfied. Discoveries in medicine meant surgery has more often been replaced with administration of hormones, commonly by nurses. The courts were responsible for determining whether they were acting unlawfully, not being medical practitioners as defined under the Act. The courts found that the Act was intended to provide for safe abortions and that nurses could carry out such abortions.

==Aids to interpretation==

===Internal aids to statute interpretation===

Generally, [[prima facie]] must be given as a general rule of statutory interpretation. If the words are clear and free from ambiguity there is no need to refer to other means of interpretation. However, if the words in the statute are vague and ambiguous, then internal aid may be consulted for interpretation. This means the statute should be read in whole, what is not clear in one section may be explained in another section.

Internal aids include the following:

:*Context
:*Title
:**Long Title
:**Short Title
:*Preamble 
:*Headings
:*Proviso
:*Definition/interpretation Clause
:*Conjunctive and Disjunctive Words
:*Punctuation

===External aids to statute interpretation===

Aids that are external to a statute (i.e., not part of an act) can also be used as recourse.

External aids include the following:

== Australia ==

The [[Acts Interpretation Act 1901]] of Australia states that the interpretation that best achieves the purpose or object of the act is to be preferred to all other interpretations. When determining the purpose of a statutory provision courts ought to keep in mind the contexts for the provision at the outset rather than only when ambiguity or inconsistency exists.  The statutory context 1) explanatory memoranda that are relevant to the statute and 2) reports of advisory bodies, such as [[Australian Law Reform Commission|law commissions]], that created the need for the particular statutory provisions. (See CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited(1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; also see Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s15AB.)

Whereas other commonwealth countries embraced purposivism much earlier, the High Court of Australia has only been receptive to purposivism since the 1970s. Historically, Australian legalism (a variant of originalism) persevered for many years following the landmark decision in the [[Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd.|Engineers Case]]. Sometimes considered aggressively textualist, Australian legalism emphasizes the importance of and attends only to the words in the statute when determining meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court remains entrenched in the tradition of textualism and original meaning more than the typical European, Canadian or even American jurist however, [[Michael McHugh (judge)|Justice McHugh]] refers to Australian legalism as "faint-hearted", as the Court's focus on textualism does not preclude its ability to evaluate extrinsic evidence. The move away from staunch textualism is largely attributed to the "revolution" of the Mason Court.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Court of Australia#Mason court|Mason Court's]] utilization of legislative debates marks the departure from strict Australian legalism.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the other radical innovations of the Mason Court, the use of extraneous materials has resulted in considerable tension between the textualist history and the purposive future. While there has been some retrogressive action since the Mason Court, Australian constitutional interpretation is now arguably pluralistic, similar to that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Australian jurist [[Jeffrey Goldsworthy]] the Mason Court's "revolutionary" attitude is partially attributed to Mason, Deane and Gaudron all receiving their education from the University of Sydney where they were exposed to "more pragmatic, consequentialist legal theories than many of their predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

===Statutory interpretation===
In Canada, the purposive approach was developed and expanded by [[Elmer Driedger]] in his 1974 book, ''The Construction of Statutes''. Driedger referred to this approach not as "purposive", but as "the modern principle" of statutory interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Sullivan, ''Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes.'' (Fifth edition). Toronto: LexisNexis Canada, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has since been endorsed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in a number of cases, and is now the dominant approach to statutory interpretation.

In ''[[Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)|Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd]]'', [1998] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii837/1998canlii837.html] Justice [[Frank Iacobucci|Iacobucci]], speaking for the whole court, wrote the following:

{{cquote|Elmer Driedger in ''Construction of Statutes'' (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87 he states: "Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."}}

Justice Iacobucci went on to cite section 10 of Ontario's  [[Quasi-constitutionality|quasi-constitutional]] ''Interpretation Act'', which stated, "Every Act shall be deemed to be remedial ... and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit." Similar provisions exist in the ''[[Interpretation Act]]'' of each province of Canada as well as at the federal level.

The purposive approach was reinforced in ''[[Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex]]'', [2002] [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc42/2002scc42.html], where Justice Iacobucci, again for the whole court, reiterated that Driedger's rule is the overarching approach to statutory interpretation in Canada. Other philosophies, such as a strict interpretation of penal statutes, may apply in the case of an ambiguity, but only in the case of an ambiguity that arises ''following'' the application of the modern rule.

The Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Free World Trust v. Électro Santé Inc.]]'' [2000][http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc66/2000scc66.html] set out "the test for [[patent infringement]]" and "the principles of purposive claim construction".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Free+World+Trust%22&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;start=10 "Free World Trust" : Google News Archives Search]''.

Centre CDP Capital et LEGER ROBIC RICHARD, p.8. Accessed 30-03-2008.{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional interpretation===
Purposive interpretation is also used in constitutional interpretation. In ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'', [1985], Justice [[Brian Dickson|Dickson]], speaking for the majority of the court, wrote, at paragraph 116:

{{cquote|[T]he proper approach to the definition of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the ''Charter'' was a purposive one. The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the ''Charter'' was to be ascertained by an analysis of the '''purpose''' of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect.

In my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger objects of the ''Charter'' itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the ''Charter''. The interpretation should be ... a generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the ''Charter'' 's protection. At the same time it is important not to overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom in question, but to recall that the ''Charter'' was not enacted in a vacuum, and must therefore ... be placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and historical contexts.}}

==Israel==

Israel's legal community is largely purposivist in nature and has rejected such methods of interpretation as narrow textualism and static historicism.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jamal, On the Origins of Originalism (August 16, 2009). Texas Law Review, Vol. 88; Columbia Public Law Research Paper No. 09-201.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "purposive interpretation" began to appear in Israel at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Aharon. Purposive Interpretation In Law. Princeton University Press (New Jersey), 2005, pg 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Aharon Barak is Israel's best-known champion of purposivism. His particular form of puposivism  includes a synthesis of subjective elements, such as author's intent, with objective elements, such as textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Frank B., The Theory and Practice of Statutory Interpretation&lt;/ref&gt; Barak believes the text to be the source of purpose but is ready to go beyond the text in some circumstances to examine the subjective purposes of the text's author. Barak believes intentionalism is too limited in its assessment of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Frank B., The Theory and Practice of Statutory Interpretation&lt;/ref&gt;

"On a number of occasions, Justice Barak of the Israeli Supreme Court has remarked that, in the enactment of its new [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Laws]] on human rights, Israel walks in the path of the Canadian Charter of RIghts and Freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, Lorraine, The Canadian Charter as a Model for Israel's Basic Laws&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ha-Redeye, Omar, Canada Is the World’s Constitutional Superpower&lt;/ref&gt; Barak has encouraged Israel's judiciary to make reference to the Canadian Supreme Court's purposive approach to Charter rights and its rights-forwarding orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, Lorraine, The Canadian Charter as a Model for Israel's Basic Laws&lt;/ref&gt; Barak has not only written in support of purposive interpretation but also applied it while serving as a Justice to the Supreme Court of Israel. In CA 165/82 ''Kibbutz Hatzor v Assessing Officer'', 39(2) P.D 70, his judgment was seen as a turning point in the interpretation of tax law in Israel, establishing that a purposive approach was generally preferred to textualism in determining the meaning of the law.

==New Zealand==
Section 5(1) of the ''Interpretation Act 1999'' states that Acts are to be interpreted according to their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;R. Scragg, ''New Zealand's Legal System: the principles of legal method'' (2nd ed., OUP, 2009), chapters 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
A 1969 report of the English [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] proposed for the English courts to adopt the purposive approach.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Aharon. ''Purposive Interpretation In Law''. Princeton University Press (New Jersey), 2005, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; That prestigious endorsement did much to boost the profile and credibility of the approach, but several decades would still pass before purposivism would win acceptance outside of narrow fact patterns (such as estoppels and absurdities) in the English courts, exceptions enshrined by cases such as the [[Earl of Oxford's case]] (1615).

The leading case in which purposivism was definitively accepted by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] was ''[[Pepper v Hart]]'' [1993] AC 593. The case established the principle that when primary legislation is ambiguous and certain criteria are satisfied, courts may refer to statements made in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or the [[House of Lords]] in an attempt to interpret the meaning of the legislation. Before the ruling, such an action would have been seen as a breach of [[parliamentary privilege]]. The House of Lords held that courts could now take a purposive approach to interpreting legislation when the traditional methods of statutory construction are in doubt or result in an absurdity.

To find what Parliament intended, all sources including [[Hansard]] may be consulted. Lord Griffiths stated:

{{cquote|My Lords, I have long thought that the time had come to change the self-imposed judicial rule that forbade any reference to the legislative history of an enactment as an aid to its interpretation. The ever increasing volume of legislation must inevitably result in ambiguities of statutory language which are not perceived at the time the legislation is enacted. The object of the court in interpreting legislation is to give effect so far as the language permits to the intention of the legislature. If the language proves to be ambiguous I can see no sound reason not to consult Hansard to see if there is a clear statement of the meaning that the words were intended to carry. The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language. The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give effect to the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted. Why then cut ourselves off from the one source in which may be found an authoritative statement of the intention with which the legislation is placed before Parliament?}}

==United States==
American jurist [[Henry M. Hart, Jr.]], and Albert Sacks, are considered early proponents of American purposivism. Their work helped to promote purposivism as a credible method of interpretation. Purposivism in the United States is considered a strain of originalism, alongside textualism and intentionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, Paul. A Review of ''Just Do It! Eskridge's Critical Pragmatic Theory of Statutory Interpretation''. 41 McGill L.J. 713 (Canada), 1996, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt; While the current focus of the interpretation debate is between textualism and intentionalism, the less popular purposivism is gaining favour.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rosensaft, "The Role of Purposivism in the Delegation of Rulemaking Authority to the Courts" (March 2, 2004). bepress Legal Series. Working Paper 160. 
http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/160&lt;/ref&gt; Purposivism in the United States is used to interpret a statute with broadly worded text and a seemingly clear purpose. When employing purposivism, the court is concerned with understanding the purpose or "spirit" of the law. Once the purpose is identified, the text is then read accordingly. In order to determine and interpret the purpose of a statute, courts may consult extraneous aids.

The following extraneous aids have been ranked from least authoritative to most authoritative: subsequent history, nonlegislator proponents of drafters, rejected proposals, colloquy on floor &amp; hearing, sponsor statements and committee reports.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rosensaft, "The Role of Purposivism in the Delegation of Rulemaking Authority to the Courts" 29 Vermont L.R. 611 p. 628&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these extraneous aids are given a corresponding weight to their position in the hierarchical ranking.

The academic literature indicates several variations of purposivism. For example Abbe Gluck said “There are different stripes of purposivists...”&lt;ref&gt;Gluck, Abbe R., "The States as Laboratories of Statutory Interpretation: Methodological Consensus and the New Modified Textualism" 119 Yale L.J. 1750 p. 1764&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer M. Bandy stated, “Thus, Justice Breyer’s strain of purposivism focuses on understanding the law in relation to both the people who passed it and the people who must live with it."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer M. Bandy, Interpretive Freedom: A Necessary Component of Article III Judging , 61 Duke Law Journal 651-691 (2011). http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol61/iss3/3&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees of purposivism are sometimes referred to as ‘strong’ or ‘weak’.

As the Court's leading purposivist Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] considers determining and interpreting the purpose of a statute paramount.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Liu, Essay, Astrue v. Ratliff and the  Death of Strong Purposivism, 159 U. PA. L. REV. PENNUMBRA 167 (2011), http://www.pennumbra.com/essays/03-2011/Liu.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; An apt example of Breyer's approach might be his dissent in ''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'' (2008), where he faulted the court's construction of a treaty because "it looks for the wrong thing (explicit textual expression about self-execution) using the wrong standard (clarity) in the wrong place (the treaty language)"; in response, the Court "confess[ed] that we do think it rather important to look to the treaty language to see what it has to say about the issue. That is after all what the Senate looks to in deciding whether to approve the treaty".&lt;ref&gt;Medellín v. Texas, 128 S. Ct. 1346 p.1362 https://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=11739881109643845873&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m8jkT67fNujo0QGl_bDKCQ&amp;ved=0CAgQgAMoADAA&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to Justice Breyer’s strong form of purposivism, "weak purposivists" might consult the statute's purpose only as a device for interpreting vague provisions of its text, and in no circumstances to override the text.

The '''Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments''' or '''Roerich Pact''' is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].

== Nicholas Roerich ==
{{main|Nicholas Roerich}}
[[File:N Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nicholas Roerich]].]]

Russian painter and philosopher [[Nicholas Roerich]] (1874–1947)&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Brenner]], "Nicholas Roerich. Idealist and Visionary", ''[[Foreign Affairs Journal]]'', April 1990&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of "Peace of Civilizations". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of [[International Conference of American States|American states]] in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in [[St. Petersburg]]. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to [[Paris]] to take lessons from [[Fernand Cormon]], the well known tutor of [[Van Gogh]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]]. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married [[Helena Roerich|Helena Shaposhnikova]], who later developed the [[Agni Yoga]] philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian [[Tsar Nicolas II]] himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], premiered in St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]], to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the [[October Revolution]] and [[Finnish Civil War]], the family travelled across several [[Scandinavia]]n countries to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and eventually left for [[North America]] in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: "[[Cor Ardens]]" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corardens.com/|title=Scripture Speaks - Savoring the deep meaning of the Word of God which unfolds each year in the liturgy, revealing the fundamental mysteries of our faith.|website=Corardens.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Master Institute of United Arts" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich biographical outline|website=Roerich.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Roerich Museum]] was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in [[Manhattan]], at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive.

After leaving America, the Roerichs had settled down in the [[Kulu Valley]] at the bottom of the [[Himalayas]] where they established the [[Urusvati Institute]]. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.

Roerich was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

== Origins of the Roerich Pact ==
An idea about the protection of [[cultural monuments]] was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Saint-Petersburg province]], Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Suzdal]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Izborsk]] and [[Pskov]]. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited [[Uglich]], [[Kalyazin]], [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] and [[Tver]]. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Summarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article "Along the old times" (1903): "Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it".

In 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's [[Russian Archeological Society|Russian Archeologist Society]] about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.

During the [[Russian-Japan war]] (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments.  In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article "Silent Pogroms" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of [[St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl]]: "Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...".

In 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the [[Imperial Russian army]], as well as the governments of the [[United States]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster "Enemy of Mankind" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture "Glow" expressing a protest against [[World War I]].

In 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II]] and Great Prince [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Nicholas Nikolayevich]] containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.

In 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with [[Georgi Shklyaver|G.G. Shklyaver]] (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of [[international law]] and political sciences at [[Paris University]] prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the [[Banner of Peace]]. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.

== The Roerich Pact ==
In 1929 Roerich in collaboration with [[Paris University]] professor G.G. Shklyaver  (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the [[Red Cross]] for medical neutrality.

In 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at [[League of Nations]] and also by the Committee of the [[Pan-American Union]]. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth [[UNESCO]] General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.

Ideas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the [[international law]], especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|100px|right|The Pax Cultura emblem.]]
[[File:Pax-roerix-50.jpg|thumb|200px|right|50 years of the Roerich Pact]]

"''Pax Cultura''" ("Cultural Peace" or "Peace through Culture") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]]n nations, agreeing that "historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the ''Banner of Peace'', bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.

According to the Roerich Museum, "The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roerich.org/nr.html?mid=pact ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention of 1954]]. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.

== The Roerich Pact importance for the 21st century ==
The Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state [[budget]] annually spent on culture, art and
education, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.

Important in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.

Nicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], "Beauty will save the World!" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian [[Renaissance]], and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.

Roerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the [[rule of law]] and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: "In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Barenboim P., Sidiqi N. ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75th Anniversary of the Roerich Pact'']. М., Letny Sad; Grid Belgium, 2010. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rule of Law article in the West's Encyclopedia of American Law&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of [[Rule According to Higher Law]] ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.

According to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, Op.cit. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis R. Elbinger, "The Unifying Power of Art", in Foreign Service Journal, April 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== World League of Culture and World Day of Culture ==
In the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.

Characterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut [[Alexey Leonov|A.A. Leonov]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developing the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician [[Dmitry Likhachov|D.S. Likhachev]]. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.

In his article "Pain of the Planet" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: "The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity".

The cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of [[Universal Day of Culture|World Day of Culture]]. N. Roerich wrote:
"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…"

The '''royal prerogative''' is a body of customary authority, privilege, and immunity, recognized in [[common law]] and, sometimes, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions possessing a monarchy, as belonging to the [[monarch|sovereign]] and which have become widely vested in the government.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Commonwealth realms]], the wording ''[[the crown]]'' is usually used in this context instead of ''king'' or ''queen''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the means by which some of the [[executive (government)|executive]] powers of government, possessed by and vested in a monarch with regard to the process of governance of the state, are carried out.

==Evolution==
In most [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], prerogatives can be abolished by Parliament as the courts apply the constitutional near-absolute of the [[supremacy of Parliament]]. In the [[Commonwealth realms]] this draws on the constitutional statutes at the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] when [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] were invited to take the throne.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the remaining powers of the royal prerogative are devolved to the head of the government which for more than two centuries has been the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; the benefits, equally, such as [[mineral rights]] in all gold and silver ores, vest in (belong to) the government.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Case of Mines]]'' [1568] ([[Elizabeth I of England|Regina]] v [[Earl of Northumberland]])&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, prerogative powers were originally exercised by the monarch acting, without an observed requirement for [[Parliament of England|parliament]]ary consent (after its empowerment in certain matters following [[Magna Carta]]). Since the accession of the [[House of Hanover]] these powers have been, with minor exceptions in economically unimportant sectors, exercised on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the [[Prime Minister]] or the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], who are accountable to Parliament, exclusively so, except in matters of the Royal Family, since at least the time of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

Typically in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] that are [[constitutional monarchies]] as well as [[nation states]], such as those of [[List of Danish monarchs|Denmark]], [[King of Norway|Norway]], or [[King of Sweden|Sweden]], the royal prerogative serves in practice as a prescribed ceremonial function of the ''state power''.

===Ministerial exercise of the monarch's prerogatives===
Today, prerogative powers fall into two main categories:

*Those directly exercised by ministers without the approval of parliament, including, in some countries, such as the UK the powers to regulate the civil service, issue passports and grant honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/public-administration-select-committee/pasc-19/| title= UK Parliament – PASC 19| publisher= Queen's Printer for Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Those exercised nominally by the monarch, "on the advice of" (that is, by constitutional convention, however so requested by) the [[prime minister]] and on the advice of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. 

Some key areas of government are carried out by the royal prerogative but its usage is falling as functions are progressively made statutory.

==Commonwealth realms==
===Australia===
In Australia, the royal prerogative is vested in the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, and this is included in the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s68.html |title=Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act – Sect 68 Command of naval and military forces| publisher=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts | accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the royal prerogative is, for the most part, the same as that in the United Kingdom, as constrained by constitutional convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hicks| first=Bruce M.| year=2010| title=British and Canadian Experience with the royal prerogative| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=Summer 2010| pages=18–24| publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/sites/lop/infoparl/33/2/33n2_10e_Hicks.pdf| accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its exercise is usually through the federal [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] or the [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]]s of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] in their respective [[privy council]]s. The royal prerogative in Canada is largely set out in Part III of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], particularly section 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_9 Canada Department of Justice, ''Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Law Times"&gt;{{cite news| title= War power and the royal prerogative| publisher=Law Times| date=2006-05-01| url=http://www.lawtimesnews.com/20060501549/Headline-News/War-power-and-the-Royal-Prerogative| accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As foreign affairs are a matter of royal prerogative,&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0860-e.htm#TheRoyal| last=Barnett| first=Laura| last2=Spano| first2=Sebastian| editor-last=Libaray of Parliament| title=Parliamentary Involvement in Foreign Policy| date=10 November 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the power to declare war and deploy the [[Canadian Forces|armed forces]] belongs to the Crown, though only in its [[Cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]] (the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]), as outlined in sections 9 and 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867.&lt;ref name="Law Times"/&gt; Neither legislation nor any other type of parliamentary approval, beyond budgetary matters, is required for such actions, though the Cabinet has on occasion consulted parliament before engaging Canada or extending Canada's involvement in a conflict.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt; Additionally, the federal and provincial crowns may ratify treaties, though only so far as they fall within the proper area of jurisdiction, according to sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Again, the endorsement of parliament is not necessary for these agreements to have force in an international sense, but the legislatures must pass treaties in order for them to have domestic effect. Proposed treaties have also occasionally been presented to parliament for debate before ratification.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt; Members of Parliament have tabled bills seeking to curtail the use of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs by legislating a greater role for parliament, as have [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] standing committees, from time to time, called for the same.&lt;ref name=Barnett /&gt;

[[Canadian passport#Rights to a passport|The issuance of passports]] also remains within the royal prerogative in Canada. The terms for the issuing of passports by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Crown are set out in the Canadian Passport Order,&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Passport Order'', SI/81-86.&lt;/ref&gt; issued by the Governor General-in-Council. The Canadian government has used the royal prerogative on two occasions to deny a passport to a Canadian citizen, [[Abdurahman Khadr]] and [[Fateh Kamel]]. Lawsuits filed at the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and ultimately the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] did not find in favour of either Khadr, nor Kamel.

The royal prerogative in Canada extends also to the granting of honours, as explained by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in [[Black v. Chrétien]] (regarding [[Conrad Black]]'s entitlement to an appointment to the [[House of Lords]] while a Canadian citizen).&lt;ref name="Law Times"/&gt; Other royal prerogatives, such as the prerogative of mercy, also exist in the Canadian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cloverdale ARPA| url=http://arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/pro-life/81-latimers-appeal-for-the-royal-prerogative-of-mercy| title=Latimer's Appeal for the royal prerogative of Mercy| publisher=ARPA Canada| date=| accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[Kingdom of England]] (up to 1707), the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (1707–1800), and the [[United Kingdom]] (since 1801), the royal prerogative was one of the central features of the [[Commonwealth realm|realm]]'s governance.

Constitutional theorist [[A. V. Dicey]] gives the standard definition of what prerogative powers as follows:

{{quote|... the remaining portion of the Crown's original authority, and it is therefore ... the name for the residue of discretionary power left at any moment in the hands of the Crown, whether such power be in fact exercised by the King himself or by his Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/42204.htm House of Commons – Public Administration – Fourth Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scope of the royal prerogative is difficult to determine due to the [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]] nature of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution]]. It is clear that the existence and extent of the power is a matter of the [[common law of England]], making the courts the final arbiter of whether a particular type of prerogative exists or not. Nevertheless, certain prerogative powers have been widely acknowledged and accepted over time, while others have fallen out of use.

The royal prerogative is not constitutionally unlimited. In the [[Case of Proclamations]] (1611) during the reign of King [[James I of England|James VI/I]], English common law courts judges emphatically asserted that they possessed the right to determine the limits of the royal prerogative. Since the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, which brought co-monarchs [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[William III of England|King William III]] to power, this interpretation of there being a separate and distinct power of the Judiciary has not been challenged by [[the Crown]]. It has been accepted that it is emphatically the province of the court(s) to say what the law is, or means. This is a crucial corollary and foundation to the concept of the judicial power; and its distinct and separate nature from the executive power possessed by the Crown itself, or its ministers.

====British dependencies====
Generally, [[the Crown]] retains all the power of the state in a Crown colony (even if in practice it is not directly exercised), which was later renamed ‘dependent territory’ in 1983 and has been known as ‘overseas territory’ since 2002.  Thus the royal prerogative is in theory an unlimited, arbitrary authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Campbell v. Hall]], 1774&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[British overseas territories]] however, each inhabited territory has a constitution by which the territory is governed locally.

The absoluteness of the royal prerogative in the colonies was however defeated in the case of ''[[Campbell v. Hall]]'' in 1774. This case decided that once a colony gained a representative assembly (or once the governor has been instructed to call one), the royal authority is limited to the familiar prerogatives; without the assembly's consent the Crown could not raise taxation nor change the law. Several of the colonies of the British West Indies thus became "settled colonies", and reverted to "crown colony" status only by Act of Parliament in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. The St. Vincent and Grenada Constitution Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 47)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 the government of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], a UK dependency, was revested in the [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governor]], on the advice of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]], under an [[Order in Council]]&lt;ref&gt;The Turks and Caicos Islands Constitution (Interim Amendment) Order 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of 18 March 2009, which suspended and amended parts of the Islands' constitution, and vacated all the offices of [[Government minister|ministers]] and the House of Assembly. This was not itself an exercise of the royal prerogative, as it was made under "the West Indies Act 1962 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so". However, in effect the order extended the royal prerogative in the Islands, vesting wide discretionary legislative and executive powers in [[Majesty|Her Majesty]]'s governor. The governor remains subject to the amended constitution, and in practice to the instructions of [[Queen regent|the Queen]]'s [[Foreign Office]] in the UK.

In the case of the [[Chagos Archipelago]], in 2000, the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]] ruled that a local ordinance made by the Commissioner of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] exiling the islanders was unlawful, a decision which was accepted by the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Robin Cook]]. That Order was legislation passed under authority given by the royal prerogative, not an exercise of the prerogative itself, and was overturned as being beyond the powers given. After this decision, the British government issued an [[Order in Council]], a primary exercise of the royal prerogative, to achieve the same objective. This Order was also ruled unlawful by the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]], a ruling upheld in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]].  However, on Wednesday, 22 October 2008, the government won its appeal in the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] against the previous rulings. The House decided by a three-to-two majority that the Order in Council was a lawful exercise of authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdjVkpT6_bzQxOkAQiXHQRIerOtw Britain wins appeal over Chagos islanders' return home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAGxtNEsx6bLfJqWoxpoftSmC98A Chagos islanders cannot return home] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026013052/http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAGxtNEsx6bLfJqWoxpoftSmC98A |date=26 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their speeches, the Law Lords admitted the government of the day was morally wrong to force out some 2,000 residents of the Chagos Archipelago, a British Crown colony, to make way for a US air base in the 1960s. Nevertheless, the majority could not find legal fault in the Order.

===Other Commonwealth realms===
In the other [[Commonwealth realms]], the royal prerogative can be or is specifically mandated to be exercised by the monarch's representative, the [[governor-general]]. The [[constitution]] of a Commonwealth realm may sharply limit the prerogative and many governmental acts which would be done under the prerogative in other countries are given effect by the constitution or Acts of Parliament in the Commonwealth realm.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], Title II ''The Crown'', Article 62, delineates the powers of the king, while Title IV ''Government and Administration'', Article 99, defines the king's role in government.&lt;ref name="Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78"&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II.

== International level ==
{{See also|List of LGBT-related cases before international courts and quasi-judicial bodies}}
Several attempts have been made to establish a right to same-sex marriage at the international level through strategic litigation, at the [[Human Rights Committee]] of the United Nations and at the [[European Court of Human Rights]], both of which currently have not yet recognized an equal right to marry for same-sex couples. The Human Rights Committee case was in 1999, with two same-sex couples as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of New Zealand as the defender/respondent. The ECHR case, ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', was in 2010, with a same-sex couple as the plaintiffs/petitioners and the government of Austria as the respondents. Although both New Zealand and Austria then responded against the petitions then in each case, both countries now legally recognize same-sex unions, New Zealand in the form of same-sex marriage and Austria in the form of a registered partnership.

When the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] ordered that its judgment come into effect immediately, the courts in British Columbia and Quebec subsequently amended their recent decisions to do the same, enabling same-sex couples to marry in all three provinces.

| A gay couple asked a Family Court in 2013 for the right to the benefits of de facto unions afforded to heterosexual couples. On 2 June 2015, the court ruled for the plaintiffs granting them pension, visitation and inheritance rights in their verdict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

'''Session laws''' are the collection of [[statute]]s enacted by a [[legislature]] during a single session of that legislature, often published following the end of the session as a bound volume. The [[United States Statutes at Large]] are an example of session laws which are published biennially, because the United States Congress meets for two years per session. Session laws are typically published annually or biennially, depending on the length of the session of the legislature, which in turn typically depends on the frequency with which general elections of the legislature are held.

Laws that are enacted during a session may modify existing statutes of the jurisdiction, or may need to be added to the collection of statutes. If the agency responsible for printing updated statutes has not yet published a new collection of statutes containing the amendments or additions passed during a recent legislative session, people who need to refer to the changes may refer directly to the session laws. Furthermore, some laws may be passed during a legislative session that are not intended to apply to the general population. Such laws might never be added to the statutes of the jurisdiction, and might only be contained in the session laws.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Mark C. Patronsky, ''Laws Not Printed in the Statutes'' (Wisconsin Legislative Council Staff Information Memorandum, August 28, 1973), p. 2 (discussing Wisconsin session laws not published in the state statutes).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Computer programs, software and patent law}}
The '''software patent debate''' is the argument about the extent to which, as a matter of [[public policy]], it should be possible to [[software patent|patent software]] and computer-implemented inventions. Policy debate on software patents has been active for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nichols |first=Kenneth |title=Inventing Software: The Rise of "computer-related" Patents |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1998 |page=15 |isbn=1-56720-140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opponents to software patents have gained more visibility with fewer resources through the years than their pro-patent opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Välimäki |first=Mikko |title=The Rise of Open Source Licensing |publisher=Turre Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=952-91-8779-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments and critiques have been focused mostly on the economic consequences of software patents.

One aspect of the debate has focused on the proposed [[European Union]] [[Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions|directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]], also known as the "CII Directive" or the "Software Patent Directive," which was ultimately rejected by the [[European Parliament|EU Parliament]] in July 2005.

== Arguments for patentability ==
There are several arguments commonly given in defense of software patents or defense of the [[patentability]] of computer-implemented inventions.

===Public disclosure===
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the open sharing of information and additional transparency about [[Legal liability|legal exposure]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallini|first=Nancy T|date=2002-06-01|title=The Economics of Patents: Lessons from Recent U.S. Patent Reform|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330027292|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=131–154|doi=10.1257/0895330027292|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the transfer of [[Mechanical system|mechanical technology]], which may apply more broadly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic benefit===
*Software patents resulting from the production of patentable ideas can increase the valuation of small companies.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/e_commerce/pat_help.htm |title=Ways in Which Patents can Help Your E-Commerce Business |publisher=World International Property Organization |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Software patents increase the return on investment made, which includes government funded research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coriat|first=Benjamin|title=Establishing a New Intellectual Property Rights Regime in the United States: Origins, Content and Problems|journal=Research Policy|year=2002|volume=31|issue=8–9|pages=1491–1507|doi=10.1016/s0048-7333(02)00078-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encouragement of innovation===
*The ability to patent new software developed as a result of research encourages investment in software-related research by increasing the potential return of investment of said research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323582904578487200821421958|title=The Experts: Does the Patent System Encourage Innovation?|date=2013-05-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-29|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright limitations===
{{Main|Copyright infringement of software}}
Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying which is not necessary for patent infringement.

Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are [[algorithm]]s; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.law360.com/articles/5115/experts-debate-constitutionality-of-software-copyrights | title=Experts Debate Constitutionality Of Software Copyrights | access-date = 2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that patents incentivize projects that are unique and innovative in functionality rather than simply form.  Copyrights, in turn, only incentivize uniqueness in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://partnershipforamericaninnovation.org/software-myths-and-facts/#copyrightenough | title=Software Myths and Facts | access-date = 2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protection for small companies ===
Software patents can afford smaller companies market protection by preventing larger companies from stealing work done by a smaller organization, leveraging their greater resources to go to market before the smaller company can.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-we-need-software-patents-and-yes-im-smarter-than-you/|title=Why we need software patents, and yes, I'm smarter than you {{!}} ZDNet|last=Shaw|first=Steven|work=ZDNet|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware patents analogy===
Hardware and software are sometimes interchangeable. If people can patent hardware, then ideas describing software implemented by that hardware should also be patentable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323335404578444683887043510|title=Should Patents Be Awarded to Software? | access-date = 2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against patentability ==
Opponents of software patents argue that:

=== Software is math ===
A program is the transcription of an [[algorithm]] in a [[programming language]]. Since every ([[Turing-complete]]) programming language implements Church's [[lambda calculus]] by virtue of the [[Church-Turing thesis]], a program is thus the transcription of a mathematical function. Math is not patentable. Therefore, neither is software.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Jones, [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091111151305785 An Explanation of Computation Theory for Lawyers].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software encourages patent thickets===
A [[patent thicket]] is a dense web of patents that companies must decipher to develop new technology. There are various types of patent thickets such as when a single innovation is protected by multiple patent holders or when a product is covered by numerous patents. The consequences of patent thickets are increased difficulty of innovation, complex cross-licensing relations between companies, and discouragement of newcomers from entering the software industry.&lt;ref&gt;González, A. G. (2006). The software patent debate. Journal of Intellectual Property Law &amp; Practice, 1(3), 196–206. doi:10.1093/jiplp/jpi046&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinders research and development===
* Some scientific studies and expert reviews have concluded that patent systems paradoxically hinder technological progress&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Adam B.; Lerner, Joshua. Innovation and its discontents: how our broken patent system is endangering innovation and progress. {{ISBN|978-0-691-11725-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows monopolies and powerful companies to exclude others from industrial science in a manner that is irreconcilable with [[anti-trust]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patents, Potential Competition, and Technical Progress |author=Almarin Phillips |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=56 |issue=1/2 |date=March 1, 1966 |pages=301–310 |jstor=1821293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gary Becker]], Nobel Prize–winning economist, argues, "Their exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations, but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more than compensate the economy for that cost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Timothy B.|title=Here’s why economists hate software patents|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/07/31/heres-why-economists-hate-software-patents/|accessdate=31 August 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinders innovation===
* The Electronic Frontier Foundation published the [[Defend Innovation]] whitepaper after doing two and a half years of research on software patents. They concluded that many overbroad software patents are being awarded, which is actually stifling innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-outlines-plan-fix-broken-patent-system |title=EFF Outlines Plan to Fix the Broken Patent System |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interoperability]] is thought to promote innovation, and patent systems have the potential to block the development of such technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Pamela|year=2008|title=Are Patents on Interfaces Impeding Interoperability|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2712&amp;context=facpubs|journal=Berkeley Law|volume=|pages=|via=Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There has been a lack of empirical evidence to suggest that patents have any positive effect on innovation, and furthermore, the system primarily “encourage[s] failing monopolists to inhibit competition by blocking innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boldrin|first=Michele|last2=Levine|first2=David K|date=2013-02-01|title=The Case Against Patents|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.27.1.3|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–22|doi=10.1257/jep.27.1.3|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost and loss of R&amp;D funds===
*Should a software developer hire a [[patent attorney]] to perform a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance search]] and provide a [[clearance search and opinion|clearance opinion]], there is no guarantee that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a clearance search may not prove to be cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan, Christina and Lee, Timothy B., Scaling the Patent System (March 6, 2012). NYU Annual Survey of American Law, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2016968&lt;/ref&gt;
* For the U.S. the economic benefit is dubious. A study in 2008 found that American public companies’ total profits from patents (excluding pharmaceuticals) in 1999 were about $4 billion, but that the associated litigation costs were $14 billion.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21526370 |title=Patent medicine - Why America’s patent system needs to be reformed, and how to do it|publisher=Economist |accessdate=2011-09-26|date=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Software developers and hardware manufacturers may be forced to pay license fees for standards that are covered by patents (the so-called [[essential patents]]). Some examples are [[H.264]], [[MP3]] and [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|GIF]] (that uses the patented [[LZW]] compression algorithm) and [[JPEG]] for graphics.

===Copyright===
*It is argued that traditional copyright has provided sufficient protection to facilitate massive investment in software development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/basics/index.html |title=The Basics |publisher=NoSoftwarePatents.com |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Copyright]] is the right of an author(s) to prevent others from copying their creative work without a license. Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although registration does strengthen protection. Copyrighted material can also be kept secret.

===Software is different===
{{see also|artificial scarcity}}
* Software programs are different from other electromechanical devices because they are designed solely in terms of their function. The inventor of a typical electromechanical device must design new physical features to qualify for a patent. On the other hand, a software developer need only design new functions to create a working embodiment of the program.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/ISTAS.2002.1013821 |chapter=Intellectual property and the process of invention: Why software is different |title=IEEE 2002 International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS'02). Social Implications of Information and Communication Technology. Proceedings (Cat. No.02CH37293) |pages=236 |year=2002 |last1=Plotkin |first1=R. |isbn=0-7803-7284-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Software is a component of a machine. The computer’s hardware is generic; it performs functions that are common to all of the software that is capable of being executed on the computer. Each software program that is capable of executing on the computer is a component of the computer.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"/&gt;
* Computers "design" and build the structure of executable software. Thus, software developers do not ''design'' the executable software's physical structure because they merely provide the functional terms.&lt;ref name="rplotkin"/&gt;

===Trivial patents===
*Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.&lt;ref&gt;James Bessen &amp; Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13491-8}}: "(...) many people have focused solely on patent examination quality as the objective of reform, based largely on anecdotal evidence of trivial, obvious, or otherwise invalid patents. Although we support efforts to improve patent examination quality (large numbers of questionable patents create conditions in which poor patent notice is unavoidable), our analysis suggests that this is only part of the problem and the patent system cannot likely be fixed by addressing only this issue. Of course, the notice problems that we find central to the poor performance of the patent system are not the only ones looking for a remedy. We argue, however, that many proposed reforms, including reforms directed toward improving patent examination quality, are unlikely to be effective unless patent notice is improved generally".&lt;/ref&gt;
*Patent examiners rarely have a comprehensive knowledge of the specific technologies disclosed in the patent applications they examine. This is in large part due to the enormous number of micro-niches in the software field and the relatively limited number of examiners. So, patents are sometimes allowed on inventions that appear to be trivial extensions of existing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;James Bessen &amp; Michael J. Meurer "Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk" Princeton University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-691-13491-8}}: "It is possible, however, that features of software technology make it particularly susceptible to the patenting of obvious ideas, especially given the legal doctrines of non-obviousness developed by the Federal Circuit. For one thing, the general-purpose nature of software technology—again, because the technology is abstract, similar techniques can be used in a wide range of applications— makes it inevitable that techniques known in one realm might be applied in another, yet the documentary evidence that the Federal Circuit requires for a demonstration of obviousness might not be published."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open source disadvantage===
{{Main|Software patents and free software}}
* The free and open source software community, and many companies that use and contribute to open source oppose software patents because they can impede or prohibit the distribution of free software. They contend that patents threaten to undermine FLOSS, regardless of innovations produced by FLOSS collaborations.

===Software patents' usefulness as an information source is limited===
*Some patent disclosures in the software field are not readable to some programmers; as a result, patents are rarely used as a source of technical information by software developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/software-patents-need-shelter-from-the-storm/131591 |title=Software patents need shelter from the storm |publisher=ZDNet - Tech News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long patent pendencies===
* In the software industry, [[product lifecycle]]s churn rapidly; a product can run through its entire lifecycle and become outdated during the time it takes a patent filed on the invention underlying it to issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy A Report by the Federal Trade Commission|date=October 2003|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/promote-innovation-proper-balance-competition-and-patent-law-and-policy/innovationrpt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3, p 45}}
*According to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]’s official statistics for 2015, the average [[pendency for patent applications]] categorized under “Computer Architecture, Software, and Information Security”  was approximately two and a half years, exceeding the pendencies of all other patent categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTOFY15PAR.pdf |title=USPTO Performance and Accountability Report 2015 |publisher=United States Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The average total pendency of European technology patents in 2015 was approximately two and a half years. Technology patents in China, Korea, Japan, and Europe had first action pendencies of approximately one year compared to those in the United States, with first action pendencies of under two years. Europe and the United States have the longest total pendencies of around 26 months, while China, Korea, and Japan have shorter total pendencies from 15 to 21 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fiveipoffices.org/statistics/statisticsreports/2015edition/IP5SR2015full.pdf |title=IP5 Statistics Report 2015 |publisher=IP5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patent trolls===
*Software companies are becoming patent hoarders, spending billions of dollars on accumulating patents and even more on litigations and settlements – resources could be better put to use in creating new and innovative software advances. Too many patents are given out, making it difficult for developers to create new software due to possibility of accidental infringement. Engineers say it impedes their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.wired.com/2015/02/eff-eliminate-software-patents/| title= EFF: If You Want to Fix Software Patents, Eliminate Software Patents| access-date= 2017-04-26}} &lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2016 IBM earned 8,088 U.S. patents; thus earning the most grants from the U.S. Patent Office for the 24th year in a row. They bested their closest tech rival by more than 2,500 patents. Behemoths like IBM, Google, and Oracle gather as many patents in the fields considered 'hot' such as Artificial Intelligence to limit the innovation potential of smaller firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.uspto.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patent claims were part of the ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' case, where Oracle claimed that Google's implementation of Java within Android violated Oracle's copyright and patents. [[Duke University|Duke]] Computer Science Professor [[Owen Astrachan]] was involved in the case. 
*Not only large companies are patent hoarders. NPEs (Non-Practising Entities) are businesses that assert patents through litigation to achieve revenues from alleged infringers without practising or commercialising the technology covered by the patents they hold. NPEs are very effective in their litigations. Damages awards for NPEs almost are 3 times greater than practicing entities over the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=:https://www.pwc.com/us/en/forensic-services/publications/assets/2016-pwc-patent-litigation-study.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disproportionately harms startups===
* Patent assertion entities ([[patent trolls]]) disproportionately affect startups, which are important for job creation and innovation. Companies with less than $100M annual revenue represent two-thirds of unique defendants in troll suits. A large percentage of startups reported that being sued by trolls resulted in significant operational impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://journals.law.stanford.edu/stanford-technology-law-review/online/startups-and-patent-trolls |title=Startups and Patent Trolls |publisher=Stanford Technology Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Supreme Court decisions ==
Several [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions since 2000, as well as the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]] and district court decisions interpreting and implementing them, have dramatically impacted the status of software patents in the United States. They have particularly affected many thousands of business-method patents that issued as a result of Federal Circuit decisions in the 1990s. The two principal Supreme Court decisions were ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'' and ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]'', the latter of which confirmed the applicability of the earlier decision ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' to computer-related inventions in which a computer was used to implement an abstract principle or preexisting business practice. (These cases are the subject of separate Wikipedia articles, which discuss the background and rulings in these cases in more detail, and supply authorities supporting the generalizations about those cases that follow. Additional detail is found in the Wikipedia article ''[[Software patents under United States patent law]]'', along with supporting citations not repeated in this summary of those articles.)

=== ''Bilski'' case ===
The ''Bilski'' case involved a patent application on methods for hedging against commodity price fluctuations, which the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|PTO]] had rejected. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]], in ''[[In re Bilski]]'', upheld the PTO's rejection on the grounds that the claims failed the [[machine-or-transformation test]], which the court held should be used as the sole test of patent eligibility. The court did not hold all business methods to be patent ineligible, although a minority of the judges would have ruled that business methods are not properly the subject of patents.

The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of ineligibility, in ''[[Bilski v. Kappos]]'', but on more general, and less articulated in detail, grounds of undue abstractness. It rejected the Federal Circuit's elevation of the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of patent eligibility, saying that rather it was simply a "useful clue." The 5-4 majority refused to hold that all business methods were incapable of being patented, but four justices would have established such a rule. A concurring opinion pointed out that the Court was unanimous, however, as to many issues in the ''Bilski'' case, including a rejection of the Federal Circuit's late 1990s [[State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group|''State Street Bank'']] decision, which allowed patents on any advance, technical or nontechnical (and in that case a numerical financial calculation of stock price changes) that produces a "useful, concrete and tangible result."

The Supreme Court's ''Bilski'' decision was criticized because of its lack of detailed guidance on how to determine whether a claim was directed to an abstract idea. Nonetheless, it provided some clarification and affirmed the Federal Circuit's taking a new direction in its software-related patent cases.

=== ''Mayo'' case ===
In ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'', the Supreme Court invalidated a patent on a diagnostic method, because it non-inventively implemented a natural principle; the Court drew on cases involving computer software and other abstract ideas. In this case, the Court was much more detailed in describing how to recognize a patent-ineligible claim to an abstract idea. The ''Mayo'' methodology has come to dominate patent-eligibility law.  It revived the approach of the [[Parker v. Flook|''Flook'']] and [[Neilson v. Harford|''Neilson'']] cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive. This led to the "two-step" ''Alice'' test described next.

=== ''Alice'' case ===
At the time the ''Mayo'' case was decided, there was some uncertainty over whether it applied only to natural principles (laws of nature) or more generally to patent eligibility of all abstract ideas and general principles, including those involved in software patents. The ''Alice'' decision confirmed that the test was general. The ''Alice'' case involved patents on electronic methods and computer programs for financial-trading systems on which trades between two parties who are to exchange payment are settled by a third party in ways that reduce the risk that one party will perform while the other will not. The patents cover what amounts to a computerized escrow arrangement.

The Court held that ''Mayo'' explained how to address the problem of determining whether a patent claimed an unpatentable abstract idea or instead a potentially patentable practical implementation of an idea. This requires using a "two-step" analysis.

In the first step, the court must determine whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, or other general principle. If not, the claim is potentially patentable, subject to the other requirements of the patent code. If the answer is affirmative, the court must proceed to the next step.

In the second step of the analysis, the court must determine whether the patent adds to the idea "something extra" that embodies an "inventive concept." If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court will find the patent invalid under section 101. This means that the implementation of the idea must not be conventional or obvious to qualify for a patent. Ordinary and customary use of a general-purpose digital computer is insufficient; the Court said—"merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention."

The ruling continued with these points:

* A mere instruction to implement an abstract idea on a computer "cannot impart patent eligibility."
* "[T]he mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention." 
* "Stating an abstract idea 'while adding the words "apply it"' is not enough for patent eligibility."
* "Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment."

The ''Alice'' decision met a mixed reception, but it has profoundly affected U.S. patent law. In its wake, as explained in the [[Alice v. CLS Bank|Wikipedia article on the case]], vast numbers of so-called software and business-method patents have been invalidated (the overwhelming majority of those which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] has considered and the number of such patents issuing has drastically fallen. The ''Alice'' decision has been widely criticized for its failure to specify in detail the boundaries of patent eligibility, but it has also been defended because its unanimity tends to stabilize decisional law in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/Alice-EIPR.pdf ''Alice v CLS Bank: US Business Method and Software Patents Marching towards Oblivion?''], [2014] {{smallcaps|Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev.}} 619, 629.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent developments ===
After ''Alice'', the Federal Circuit and district courts invalidated large numbers of business-method and software patents based on those courts' interpretations of ''Alice''. Federal Circuit Judge [[William Curtis Bryson|William Bryson]] summed this up in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that they do not contain an “inventive concept” that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something “significantly more than” the ineligible abstract idea itself. [Citing ''Alice'' and ''Mayo''.] As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. [Citing ''Alice'' and ''Mayo''.] It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming “abstract ideas” and has held that they are not directed to patentable subject matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6333">The '''tiao-kuai''' ({{zh|c=条块|p=tiáo-kuài|l=branch and lump}}) system, also known as '''tiáotiáo-kuàikuài''' ({{lang|zh-hans|条条块块}}) to emphasize the plurality, describes the quasi-[[Federation|federal]] arrangement of administration in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The term ''tiáo'' refers to the vertical lines of authority over various sector reaching down from the ministries of the [[central government]].  ''Kuài'' refers to the horizontal level of authority of the territorial government at the provincial or local level. According to [[political scientist]] [[Kenneth Lieberthal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/china-environment-series-11997 "China’s Governing System And Its Impact on Environmental Policy Implementation"] by Kenneth Lieberthal&lt;/ref&gt; "The former coordinates according to function ([for] example, environment); the latter coordinates according to the needs of the locality that it governs." Thus a local environmental protection bureau may have reporting responsibilities to both the central government's State Environmental Protection Administration and to the mayor of the city in which it is located.

Constitutionally, organizations in both the functional and territorial systems of governance are assigned to a system of ranks. Central ministries are at the same rank as provincial governments. Writes Lieberthal, "One key rule of the Chinese system is that units of the same rank cannot issue binding orders to each other.   Operationally, this means that no ministry can issue a binding order to a province."  This means a province may challenge, overrule, or ignore decisions made by a ministry. This [[two-dimensional]] arrangement sometimes creates undesirable [[Group conflict|conflicts]], and there have been calls for tiao-kuai integration ({{zh|c=条块结合|p=tiáo-kuài jiéhé}}), although this is unlikely to occur due to resistance from the provinces.

==Under Maoist rule==
In 1949, the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established the [[People's Republic of China]], a constitutionally [[socialist state]]. While China experimented with centralization and decentralization policies for a few years, the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] in 1957 solidified the principle of ideological unity among all local governments.&lt;ref name="Chung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Remaking the Chinese State: Strategies, Society, and Security|editor1-first=Jianmin|editor1-last=Zhao|editor2-first=Bruce|editor2-last=Dickson|chapter=Reappraising central-local relations in Deng's China|first=Jae Ho|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|last=Chung|pages=48–50, 53, 55, 57, 59–60, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], and especially the 1971-1975 "unified income and unified expenditure" ({{lang|zh-hans|统收统支}}) period, bureaucrats across China implemented similar agricultural and industrial policies modeled in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==In the reform era==
With the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the beginning of the [[Chinese economic reform]], China adopted a policy of "emancipation of mind (from ideology)" ({{lang|zh-hans|思想解放}}) as the government sought practical solutions to economic problems that reflected local conditions. Provinces were given substantial [[economic]] and [[political authority]], such as to authorize investment projects and raise their own taxes. The [[State Planning Commission of China|State Planning Commission]]'s mandate shifted from giving annual targets to planning for the medium and long term. The central government further established [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|special economic zones]] within the coastal provinces, which the relevant subnational governments have operated and expanded upon, even establishing [[sister city]] relations internationally.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

Decentralization posed a problem for the central government in that the central government had no independent means of enforcing its authority to prevent local [[protectionism]] or enforce [[standardization|standard]]s. Hence in the 1990s, the PRC government began creating parallel central organizations to those of the provinces. Most of these organizations deal with economic [[regulation]]s. Devolution of political power to provincial People's Congresses have also occasionally caused vertical conflict, such as when Beijing appointed [[Ge Hongsheng]] as the [[Governor of Zhejiang]], who was [[vote of no confidence|voted out]] by the Zhejiang parliament in 1993. The central government now consults with provincial representatives before making sensitive personnel appointments.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

On the other hand, the rapid rise in the number of [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] as a result of [[Urbanization in the People's Republic of China|urbanization]] has checked the power of the provinces. The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]]'s control over the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) also precludes the possibility of local separatists colluding with the military against the central government.&lt;ref name="Chung"/&gt;

==Comparisons to other countries==
An analogous situation can be seen in federal systems such as the [[United States]] where the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] operate in parallel, but neither has the [[authority]] to [[wikt:command|command]] the other in relation to reserve powers or federal powers expressly delegated to the national government. Although the power relationships are similar the actual powers exercised can be quite different. For example, there are parallel institutions for [[police]] and financial securities regulation in the United States, but not in the PRC.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''tribal chief''' is the leader of a [[tribe|tribal society]] or [[chiefdom]].

==Description==
Tribal societies with [[social stratification]] under a single (or [[Diarchy|dual]]) leader emerged in the [[Neolithic]] period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the [[Iron Age]].

In the case of  [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of [[self-government]].

The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s") and/or a broader [[popular assembly]] in "parliamentary" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant [[medicineman]] (in "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as [[village headman|village chief]] (geographically defined) or [[clan chief]] (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive "tribal" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a [[Colonialism|colonial]] context, the most powerful member of either a [[confederation]] or a [[federation]] of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a [[paramount chief]]. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called [[king]]s.

A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a '''chieftainess''', a '''chieftess''' or, especially in the case of the former, a '''chief'''.

==History==
[[File:Arminius1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arminius]], a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who defeated three [[Roman legions]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].]]
Anthropologist [[Elman Service]] distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings ([[chiefdom]]s). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the [[band society]] of the [[Paleolithic]] stage and [[civilization]] with centralized, super-regional government based in [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|cities]]. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the [[Neolithic]] stage into the [[Iron Age]], albeit in competition with civilisations and [[empire]]s beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. 
An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is [[Greco-Roman ethnography]], which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era|Roman]] periods.

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the [[Migration period]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]], these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies.

Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the [[New World]]. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in [[Oceania]] and in parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during [[colonialism]], but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government.

==Modern states or regions providing an organized form of tribal chiefships==

===Arabia===
Arabs, in particular peninsular [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabs]] and nomadic Bedouins, are largely organized in tribes, many of whom have official representatives in governments. Tribal chiefs are known as [[Sheikh]]s, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism.
===Bolivia===
The [[Afro-Bolivian community|Afro-Bolivian people]], a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a 
[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|king]] whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government.

===Botswana===
In Botswana, the reigning chiefs of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national [[House of Chiefs]]. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal ''kgotlas'', meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed.

===Canada===
{{main|band government}}
The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the [[First Nations in Canada]] (formerly called "Indians").  Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the [[Indian Act]].  As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act-sanctioned formal government.  There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104948/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 |date=2013-09-22 }}. Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a national organization, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], which elects a "national chief" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada.

===Ghana===
The offices and traditional realms of the chiefs of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian [[National House of Chiefs]].

===Nigeria===
Although the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current constitution, they derive their powers from various so-called ''Chiefs laws'' and are therefore legally recognized. They usually serve as members of each federating state's [[State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs]].

===Oceania===
The [[Solomon Islands]] have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority.

===Philippines===
Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government.

===South Africa===
Such figures as the [[king of the Zulu Nation]] and the [[Rain Queen]] are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution.

===Uganda===
The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from [[Great Britain]]. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. Such figures as the [[Kabaka of Buganda]] and the [[Omukama of Toro]] typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class.

===United States===
{{further|Tribe (Native American)}}

====Historical cultural differences between tribes====
Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an [[ethnic group]], usually sharing cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s. 
For example, the forest-dwelling [[Chippewa]] historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the [[Great Plains]]-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole]]s. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might typically dwell in skin-covered [[tipi]]s rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].{{ref|FieldMuseum}} The [[Pueblo people]], meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth.

====Political power in a tribe====
A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The [[Mingo]]s, for example, were [[Iroquois]] who migrated further west to the sparsely populated [[Ohio Country]] during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, [[Hiawatha]] and [[the Great Peacemaker]], formulated a [[Iroquois constitution|constitution]] for the Iroquois Confederation.

The tribes [[Indian Wars|were pacified]] by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.

Not all tribal leaders need be men; [[Wilma Mankiller]] was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: [[Cherokee]] men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women.

Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local/Tribal_Sites.shtml |title=A-Z Index of Tribal Governments, A &amp;#124; USA.gov |publisher=Firstgov.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in a number of countries around the world.

Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the [[Pueblo people]] were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the [[Menominee Nation]] has its own county [[Menominee County, Wisconsin]] with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American.

Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the [[Black Seminole]]).

====Economic power in a tribe====
Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated [[Indian gaming]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051231031253/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/dec05/381080.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a [[United States dollar|US$]]14&amp;nbsp;billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have Native American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the [[Tiwa people|Tigua]] tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in [[El Paso County, Texas]], has paid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Lisa |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7575874/ |title=4.2 million dollars in political contributions in Texas |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-20 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a low probable return to the tribe because of the [[Jack Abramoff]] publicity.

Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the [[Mescalero Apache]] renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn.

The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the [[Shiprock]] casino was a ''[[fait accompli]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22841">The [[United States Constitution]] has had influence internationally on later constitutions and legal thinking. Its influence appears in similarities of phrasing and borrowed passages in other constitutions, as  well as in the principles of the [[rule of law]], [[separation of powers]] and recognition of [[civil liberties|individual rights]]. The United American experience of amendments and [[judicial review]] motivated constitutionalism at times when they were considering the possibilities for their nation's future. Examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the American Civil War, his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juárez]] of Mexico, and the second generation of 19th-century constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China. However, democratizing countries often chose more centralized British or French models of government, particularly the [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrill|first1=Richard J.|title=World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317228820|pages=20–27|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the later half of the 20th century, the influence of the United States Constitution may be waning as other countries have revised their constitutions with new influences.

==National constitutions==
The historian [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] argued that the United States saw itself as "one of a family of peoples and nations" making a history apart from the European civilization of their colonization.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

The United States Constitution is an expression of Americans diverging from colonial rule, according to this viewpoint. Its effect is reflected in the ideals of limiting the rulers of a state apart and above sitting law-givers in a [[parliament]]. The concepts of governance influencing others internationally are not only found among similarities in phrasing and entire passages from the U.S. Constitution. They are in the principles of the [[rule of law]] and recognition of individual rights. The American experience of fundamental law with amendments and [[judicial review]] has motivated foreign constitutionalists to reconsider possibilities for their own future.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}} This view informed [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]],{{refn| group=lower-alpha |"Secession was indeed unconstitutional...military resistance to secession was not only constitutional but also morally justified.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=3}} "the ''primary'' purpose of the Constitution was … to create ‘a more perfect union’... the Constitution was an exercise in nation building.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=198}}}} his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juarez]] of Mexico,{{refn| group=lower-alpha |Juarez regarded the United States as a model of republican democracy and consistently supported Abraham Lincoln.{{sfn|Stacy|2003|p=436}}}} and the second generation of 19th constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines{{refn| group=lower-alpha |The institutions of the two countries which have most influenced constitutional development are Spain and the United States." One of the reforms, "sine quibus non", to use the words of Rizal and Mabini, always insisted upon by the Filipinos, was Philippine representation in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortez]], the promulgation in the Islands of the Spanish Constitution, and the complete assimilation equal to that of any in the Spanish provinces on the continent.{{sfn|Malcolm|1920|p=109}}}} and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China.{{refn| group=lower-alpha |In the modern history of China, there were many revolutionaries who tried to seek the truth from the West in order to overthrow the feudal system of the [[Ching Dynasty]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] for example was much influenced by American democracy, especially the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Qing Yu|1988|p=193}}}} The [[Australian Constitution]] which came into force in 1901 was strongly influenced by the US Constitution, while at the same time preserving Westminster traditions and the British monarchy. It adopted a federal system similar to the US, with a senate that represented the states. It also adopted the concepts of a formal separation of power and judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George |last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW |isbn=978-1-86287-918-8| pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the influence of the Constitution appears in trans-national [[history of ideas]], foreign translations, and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts from the beginning with smuggled translations into [[Hispanic America]] until today with conferences among national legislators. Innovations include [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional conventions]], written constitutions, ratification and [[Constitutional amendment|amendment procedures]]. There are common provisions for presidential executives, [[federalism]] and judicial review.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

[[George Athan Billias]], studying the Constitution and related documents, describes six waves of influence:
# From 1776 to 1811, after the American Revolution began, it influenced northwestern Europe and its colonial connections.
# 1811–1848, after the decline of [[Napoleon]]'s reputation, it was referenced by Latin American, Caribbean, and European nationalists.
# 1898–1918, after the [[Spanish–American War]], nationalist movements borrowed from the U.S. Constitution in Asia and Latin America.
# 1918–1945, after World War I, its influence spread with movements for [[decolonization of Africa]], Mid-east and Asia.
# 1945–1974, after World War II, independence movements consulted it.
# 1974–1989, after [[United Nations]] expansion, once nondemocratic regimes, including European ones, transitioned towards constitutional democracies incorporating elements of the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

Over its history, the influence of American [[constitutionalism]] has waxed and waned. [[Democratization|Democratizing]] countries often chose the more centralized, consolidated British or French models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=nOUN11pmfK&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Reisman|first2=W.

Internationally it appears that those of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Islamic culture]]s do not readily adopt some of its premises. Nevertheless, "the influence of American constitutionalism abroad was profound in the past and remains a remarkable contribution to humankind's search for freedom under a system of laws."{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

According to a 2012 study published in the ''[[New York University Law Review]]'', however, the influence of the U.S. Constitution may be waning. The study examined more than 700 federal constitutions from nearly 200 countries. "Rather than leading the way for global constitutionalism, the U.S. Constitution appears instead to be losing its appeal as a model for constitutional drafters elsewhere," the researchers write. "The idea of adopting a constitution may still trace its inspiration to the United States, but the manner in which constitutions are written increasingly does not."&lt;ref name=jr-diusc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/decline-influence-united-states-constitution/ |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |date=April 9, 2013 |website=Journalist's Resource |publisher=[[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]] [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Law |first1=David S. |last2=Versteeg |first2=Mila |year=2012 |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |journal=[[New York University Law Review]] |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=762–858 |ssrn=1923556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the study found that the U.S. Constitution guarantees relatively few rights compared to the constitutions of other countries and contains less than half (26 of 60) of the provisions listed in the average bill of rights. It is also one of the few in the world today that still features the [[right to keep and bear arms]]; the only others are the constitutions of [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]]. Overall, the research suggests that the [[Constitution of Canada]], revised in 1982, is now a leading international model rather than that of the United States.&lt;ref name=jr-diusc /&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc /&gt;

In 1937 the U.S. Post Office released a commemorative stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The engraving shown on this issue is after [[commons:File:Washington Constitutional Convention 1787.jpg|an 1856 painting]] by [[Junius Brutus Stearns]] of Washington and shows delegates signing the Constitution at the 1787 Convention. George Washington is on dais with an open document in hand; James Madison sits at the table, taking his famous notes on the convention.

One commemorative of the 19th Amendment (permitting women the right to vote) was celebrated in a commemorative in 1950 and again in 1970. The woman is voting in a curtained mechanical voting booth. She chooses levers to punch or mark her votes on a paper roll. The Model T has a male driver with a banner "Votes for women" on the car, women riders and marchers as though in a parade.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] issued a commemorative of the U.S. and Polish Constitutions in 1938 under the government of Prime Minister, Major General [[Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski|Składkowski]] The stamp features George Washington in military regalia, holding a 48-star American flag and a drawn sword. Thomas Paine holds a book on a rod, and Kosciuszko poses with a cross and saber. The next scene shows a line of infantry flying a Polish flag. The right panel shows the Statue of Liberty imposed in front of the New York 1930s skyline.

In 1937 the [[Second Spanish Republic]] commemorated the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, under the government of Prime Minister [[Juan Negrín]] of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). The [[Statue of Liberty]] is the central focus, flanked by flags of Spain and the United States. The [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic Flag]] of red, yellow and purple, as battle flag or [[civil ensign]], lacks the [[Coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic|coat of arms]].

'''Women's empowerment''' is the process in which women elaborate and recreate what it is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===

Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence.
