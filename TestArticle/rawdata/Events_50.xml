The '''1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident''', occurring on 14 September 1961, was an incident during the [[Cold War (1953–1962)|Cold War]], in which two [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|''JaBoG 32'']] of the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') crossed into East German [[airspace]] because of a navigational error, before landing at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. The two planes successfully evaded a large number of Soviet fighter planes by finding cover in a heavy layer of clouds,&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45139958.html STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the actions of an airman at the [[United States Air Force]] air route traffic control center at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] who ordered the planes on to Berlin rather than forcing them to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; The event came at a historically difficult time in relations between the two Germanies. Only a month before, the [[Berlin Wall]] had been built, which completely cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. It also came three days before the [[West German federal election, 1961|West German federal election]], held on 17 September 1961.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Background==
At the time, violations of airspace at the border between West and East Germany were common, with, on average, two aircraft a month belonging to members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) crossing into Eastern airspace while a much larger number of Soviet planes crossed into that of West Germany. There were 38 violations of West Germany's air space by Soviet aircraft in a period of just four weeks between August and September 1961. Some of the violations were deliberate, to determine the opposite side's reaction, while others were by mistake, caused by the difficulty in determining the border line from the air.&lt;ref name="Monat" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45141349.html LUFTZWISCHENFALL: Zweimal monatlich] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 29 August 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the end of the Second World War and the [[German reunification]], West German planes were not permitted to fly to West Berlin, regardless of whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The three existing [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to the city were only open to planes from the three wartime [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]: the United States, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Tages" &gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/angriffshoehe-800/394316.html Angriffshöhe 800] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', published: 2 March 2003, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 September 1961, under the code name ''Checkmate'', the [[NATO]] high command mobilised the air forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany for the purpose of an [[military exercise|exercise]]. As part of this exercise, the ''[[Jagdbomber]]''s of ''[[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|Jagdbombergeschwader (JaBoG) 32]]'', based at [[Lechfeld Airbase]], south of [[Augsburg]], were to fly a triangular route from [[Würzburg]] to [[Laon]] and then to [[Memmingen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two F-84 fighter-bombers, flown by [[Feldwebel]] Peter Pfefferkorn and [[Unteroffizier|Stabsunteroffizier]] Hans Eberl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qRFggA1sMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+Eberl+14+September+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DmhvySvrU0&amp;sig=fafOuilSu-d-gI-tp-thRCLE1m4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lOL1TKfHN4nprAfn0p32Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20Eberl%2014%20September%201961&amp;f=false Krieg um Berlin?: die sowjetische Militär- und Sicherheitspolitik] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Matthias Uhl, accessed: 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; lost their course in the process of flying this route, with the compass on Pfefferkorn's plane misreading by between 40 and 60 degrees. Additionally, a strong westerly wind was greater in strength than had been forecasted. On their way from Würzburg to Laon, the two pilots had become so disoriented that they mistook [[Liège]] in Belgium for [[Reims]] in France.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Shortly after, the pair were picked up by NATO radar stations near [[Warburg]], in southern [[Westphalia]], heading east, in the direction of [[Königs Wusterhausen]], south of Berlin. The two pilots missed a radio call from the radar stations advising them to turn around because they were talking to each other, trying to establish their location.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It was only when reaching a position north of [[Leipzig]], deep within East German air space, that Pfefferkorn sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] signal, which was picked up, to their surprise, by the French-controlled airport at Tegel in [[West Berlin]], which gave them permission to land. The planes had initially not been noticed by the radar operator at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] because he was concentrating on an incoming [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6]]. By the time they were noticed, the pair were being unsuccessfully chased by a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. An airman in the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center ordered the two pilots not to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes but instead to head for the Tegel airport as it had a longer runway than Tempelhof and was more suitable for jets.&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;[http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf 50 Jahre Jagdbombergeschwader 32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193436/http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} {{de icon}} 50 Years Jagdbombergeschwader 32, accessed; 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the actions of this airman and the heavy cloud cover, which the two pilots used to conceal themselves, Pfefferkorn and Eberl escaped the pursuing Soviet aircraft and successfully landed their planes without further incident at Tegel.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Reaction==
===International===
Immediately after the two aircraft landed, the French authorities at Tegel airport explained to the Soviet authorities in East Berlin that, because of technical difficulties, an [[emergency landing]] of the two planes had been absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The then-West German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Franz-Josef Strauß]], apologised to the Soviet ambassador in [[Bonn]] for the incident, sending his secretary of state, [[Volkmar Hopf]]. The government of the Soviet Union remained silent for a number of days with regards to the incident, before officially protesting against the West German "provocation" and threatening to shoot down any aircraft involved if the incident was repeated.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Soviet air command in East Germany was less than impressed with the 'unpunished' flight of two Western fighter planes through their airspace. However, it chose to blame bad weather for the incident rather than the failure of its ground control to guide the Soviet fighter planes on to the West German ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RYYuSGcwq5AC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+and+Eberl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHqzsIhtcf&amp;sig=by3WlbzluCGCPMVwWI0WHSU6Fwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8P70TIfGFsGecfmj4dcE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20and%20Eberl&amp;f=false Vor dem Abgrund: die Streitkräfte der USA und der UdSSR] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Dimitrij N. Filippovych, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0033, Josef Kammhuber retusche.jpg|thumb|200px|Josef Kammhuber]]
[[Willy Brandt]], the leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in the upcoming federal elections, and the mayor of West Berlin, questioned how the two pilots could be put in a situation where they would be forced to violate international conventions in a time of strained relations between the East and the West. Initially, Strauß announced a stringent investigation into the incident; instead, however, he and [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], transferred the commander of ''JaBoG 32'', [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Siegfried Barth]], and announced that any commander whose unit committed a violation of international borders would be immediately replaced.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

When Kammhuber announced this order at Lechfeld the following day, it was dubbed ''Bier Order 61'' (''Beer Order 61'') because it was formulated late at night over drinks between Kammhuber and Strauß. Barth, commander of ''JaBoG 32'', was not questioned with regard to the incident, and was not allowed to speak during Kammhuber's visit. Instead, [[Generalleutnant]] [[Martin Harlinghausen]], Barth's superior officer, who had once, in 1944, stood up to [[Hermann Göring]], spoke for Barth and demanded a proper investigation.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two weeks later, Harlinghausen was forced into early retirement. The non-commissioned officers of ''JaBoG 32'' sent a letter to Strauß requesting that Barth should retain his command, without receiving any answer. Eventually, a proper investigation was conducted which found Barth to be innocent, a result unacceptable to Kammhuber, who initiated a second investigation that found the ''Oberstleutnant'' partly at fault. A third investigation followed, which again found Barth to be innocent. Oberstleutnant Barth then lodged an official complaint against Franz-Josef Strauß. Strauß, as minister of defence, ordered all witnesses in the case - Generals Kammhuber, Harlinghausen, [[Werner Panitzki]] and [[Werner Streib]] as well as Lieutenant Colonels [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Walter Grasemann]] - [[gag order|not to speak]], as they were all military personnel and therefore under his command. Nevertheless, his conduct in dismissing Barth was found to be at fault, and the latter had to be reinstated in his position. Strauß, however, ignored this decision until [[Hellmuth Heye]], [[Ombudsman]] for the Military, forced him to accept it.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; Strauß himself was later forced to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, in the wake of the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' scandal]] in 1962. Kammhuber retired from his post in the same year.

==Aftermath==
Upon arrival at Tegel, the two planes were immediately hidden in [[hangar]]s and journalists were prohibited from taking pictures of them.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; For years after, it was believed that the two planes had been repainted as aircraft of the [[United States Air Force]] and returned to West Germany by USAF pilots, or that they had been disassembled and transported back to the West in pieces.&lt;ref name="Tages" /&gt; The arrival of two massive [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124]] at Tegel from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also fuelled speculations that the two F-84s would be transported back in these aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; Another theory (which turned out to be true) held that the two aircraft were hidden by the French authorities at Tegel and, later, buried at the airfield, where they were accidentally rediscovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgmannschaft.info/forum/upload/showthread.php?t=1117 Luftraumverletzungen und -zwischenfälle über dem Gebiet der DDR]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{de icon}}, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exhibition at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr|Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow]]'' in 2006, pictures of the two buried and then rediscovered Thunderstreaks at Tegel were shown, finally clearing up the question of what became of the two planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt;

The pilots of the two Thunderstreaks, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, were banned from flying and transferred to the ground crew at Lechfeld.&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The F-84F Thunderstreak, in service with the ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' since inception of the unit on 22 July 1958, was phased out of service on 13 July 1966, the ''Geschwader'' having accumulated over 80,000 flight hours with the planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKI9zAJBsmB2e5ezvqRcNGglFR9b31fj_zcVP0A_YLciHJHR0VFAN5emug!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjBfT0tD?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB060000000001%2FW27G5DLE422INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' website – History] {{de icon}} accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 incident===
[[File:Hawker Sea Hawks of the West German Marineflieger in August 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Marineflieger-Geschwader 1]]
Eleven months after the F-84 incident, the Soviet threat of to shooting down any aircraft violating the border materialized when a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', piloted by [[Kapitänleutnant]] Knut Anton Winkler, was shot at by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters when it accidentally crossed into East German airspace near [[Eisenach]]. Winkler, who had been returning from a training exercise on board {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean, had to carry out an emergency landing at [[Ahlhorn]], 45&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The aircraft was eventually written-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/veith/seahawk.htm  DDR-Luftwaffe.de – Sea Hawk] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler himself died less than four years later in a [[F-104 Starfighter]] accident on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactus-starfighter-staffel.de/public/html/in_memoriam.html In Memoriam] List of German pilots killed in F-104 Starfighter accidents, accessed: 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities.

[[File:Victims of Abu Sleem massacre.JPG|thumb|People at a Benghazi rally looking at the photos of victims of Abu Salim prison massacre (February 2011)]]
'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmates of Abu Salim prison==
*[[Ahmed al-Senussi]], a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Johnathan |title=Gaddafi-Opfer Al-Senussi: Gott entscheidet, was mit dir passiert |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |accessdate=25 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=13 March 2011 |agency=SPIEGEL-Verlag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DGwSOUj?url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |language=German |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10562">'''Anthrax hoaxes''' involving the use of white powder or labels to falsely suggest the use of [[anthrax]] are frequently reported in the United States and globally. [[Hoax]]es have increased following the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], after which no genuine anthrax attacks have occurred. The [[FBI]] and [[United States Postal Inspection Service|U.S. postal inspectors]] have responded to thousands of "white powder events" and targets have included government offices, US embassies, banks and news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/08/nation/na-anthrax-threats8|title=Anthrax hoaxes pile up, as does their cost|last=Drogin|first=Bob|date=8 March 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America--Case Closed?|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=http://leonardcole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris released what he said was military-grade anthrax but was actually a harmless vaccine strain, but news coverage popularized the idea of anthrax among hoaxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Jonathan B.|date=July 1999|title=Historical trends related to bioterrorism: An empirical analysis|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|publisher=CDC|volume=5|issue=4|url=http://origin.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/tucker.htm | pmid = 10458952|doi=10.3201/eid0504.990406|pmc=2627752|pages=498–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/anthrax/Harris.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=5|title=The Harris Hoax|work=ADL|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these hoaxes, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] released guidance for public health authorities for handling bioterrorism threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|title=Bioterrorism Alleging Use of Anthrax and Interim Guidelines for Management -- United States, 1998|journal=MMWR|publisher=CDC|volume=48|issue=4|pages=69–74|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056353.htm|pmid=10023627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537–48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191–203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent poisoning include [[carbon monoxide detector]]s, proper venting of [[gas appliances]], keeping chimneys clean, and keeping [[exhaust system]]s of vehicles in good repair.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=National Center for Environmental|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning – Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en-us|date=30 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012403/https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving [[oxygen therapy|100% oxygen]] along with [[supportive care]].&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This should generally be carried out until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; While [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=NA|last2=Juurlink|first2=DN|last3=Isbister|first3=G|last4=Bennett|first4=MH|last5=Lavonas|first5=EJ|title=Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 April 2011|issue=4|pages=CD002041|pmid=21491385|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002041.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213–14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167–68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142–46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270–72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders.

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy. One case report and review of the literature|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|volume=18|issue=5|pages=399–401|date=September 2001|pmid=11559621|pmc=1725677|doi=10.1136/emj.18.5.399|url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11559621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farrow JR, Davis GJ, Roy TM, McCloud LC, Nichols GR |title=Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1448–52|date=November 1990|pmid=2262778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

A [[CO-oximeter]] can be used to determine carboxyhemoglobin levels.&lt;ref name="pmid455674"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodkey FL, Hill TA, Pitts LL, Robertson RF |title=Spectrophotometric measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in blood|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=8|pages=1388–93|date=August 1979|pmid=455674|doi=|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=455674|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7361284"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rees PJ, Chilvers C, Clark TJ |title=Evaluation of methods used to estimate inhaled dose of carbon monoxide|journal=Thorax|volume=35|issue=1|pages=47–51|date=January 1980|pmid=7361284|pmc=471219|doi= 10.1136/thx.35.1.47|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7361284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulse [[CO-oximeter]]s estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a [[pulse oximeter]].&lt;ref name="pmid18500075"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Coulange M, Barthelemy A, Hug F, Thierry AL, De Haro L|title=Reliability of new pulse CO-oximeter in victims of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=35|issue=2|pages=107–11|date=March 2008|pmid=18500075|doi=|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625021038/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|archivedate=2011-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries.&lt;ref name="MaiselEditorial"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Maisel | first = William | authorlink =  |author2=Roger J.

As this is not possible in people who are unresponsive, these devices may not appropriate for use in on-scene emergency care detection of CO poisoning.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

There are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref name="Kao"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kao LW, Nañagas KA |title=Toxicity associated with carbon monoxide |journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=99–125 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16567227 |doi=10.1016/j.cll.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emedicine"&gt;{{cite web | last =Shochat | first =Guy N | title =Toxicity, Carbon Monoxide | publisher =[[emedicine]] | date =17 February 2009 | url =http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | accessdate =2009-04-27 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090309072832/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | archivedate =9 March 2009 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically [[influenza|flu-like viral syndromes]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[chest pain]], and [[migraine]] or other headaches.&lt;ref name="Chest1990-ilano"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ilano AL, Raffin TA | title=Management of carbon monoxide poisoning | journal=Chest | date=Jan 1990 | pages=165–69 | volume=97 | issue=1 | pmid=2403894 | doi=10.1378/chest.97.1.165  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide has been called a "great mimicker" due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific.&lt;ref name="Kao"/&gt; Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[altitude sickness]], [[lactic acidosis]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[meningitis]], [[methemoglobinemia]], or [[Opioid overdose|opioid]] or toxic alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref name="emedicine"/&gt;

Prevention remains a vital [[public health]] issue, requiring public education on the safe operation of appliances, heaters, fireplaces, and internal-combustion engines, as well as increased emphasis on the installation of [[carbon monoxide detector]]s.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ernst A, Zibrak JD |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=339|issue=22|pages=1603–08|date=November 1998|pmid=9828249|doi=10.1056/NEJM199811263392206|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=9828249&amp;promo=ONFLNS19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is tasteless and odourless, and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell.&lt;ref name=Millar20008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air – the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145–51 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= |pmid=22692708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.&lt;ref name="cpsc.gov"/&gt; These devices, which are relatively inexpensive&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"/&gt; and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100533/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krenzelok EP, Roth R, Full R |title=Carbon monoxide ... the silent killer with an audible solution |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 1996 |pages=484–86 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=8765117 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoon SS, Macdonald SC, Parrish RG |title=Deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and potential for prevention with carbon monoxide detectors |journal=JAMA |date=March 1998 |pages=685–87 |volume=279 |issue=9 |pmid=9496987 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.9.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[smoke detector]]s, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720-2009,&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} – Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649–58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]]. The following year, Monn was responsible for the design of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [[Costume Institute Gala]].&lt;ref name="NYTInf"&gt;{{cite news | last=Trebay| first=Guy| title =Influencers Are Forever| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =June 26, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/fashion/sundaystyles/influencers-are-forever.html| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, his clients included the Guggenheim Museum, [[LVMH]], and the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (among others).&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt; In November 2007, Monn designed the [[Frank Gehry]]-inspired Guggenheim International Gala at [[Pier 40 at Hudson River Park|Pier 40]].&lt;ref name="Bash"/&gt; He also designed the 100th anniversary celebration for the [[Plaza Hotel]] that year.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news | last=Huguenin| first=Patrick| title =Event planner's the life of the party| newspaper =[[New York Daily News]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =December 15, 2007 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/event-planner-life-party-article-1.276028| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Monn designed the [[White House]] State Dinner honoring then [[Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name="NYTShopping"/&gt; In November 2016, he released his book, ''David Monn: The Art of Celebrating'', which contains 360 pages of images and text about events he has planned and designed. The book's release date was marked with a party at the New York Public Library's main campus.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD"/&gt; In January 2017, Monn designed an opening candlelight dinner for the inauguration festivities of President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="WP90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTTrump"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bernstein| first=Jacob| title =How Anna Wintour's Longtime Party Planner Turned to Trump| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =January 18, 2017 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/fashion/inauguration-donald-trump-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html?_r=0| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disaster area''' is a region or a locale, heavily damaged by either natural, technological or social hazards. Disaster areas affect the population living in the community by dramatic increase in expense, loss of energy, food and services; and finally increase the risk of disease for citizens. An area that has been struck with a natural, technological or sociological hazard that opens the affected area for national or international aid.

==Natural hazard==
A natural hazard is a negative process of phenomena created naturally (tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes) that will affect people or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/GeographyVocabularyGCSEFarming.htm |title=Geography vocabulary: Gcse farming|year=February 2012|website=www.geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tornadoes===
'''[[Tornado]]es''' are narrow aggressively rotating mixtures of air that come from the base of a thunderstorm, being the most violent of storms. Tornadoes are usually hard to see unless they form a condensations funnel made from:- dust, water droplets and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSSL: Severe Weather 101: Tornadoes. NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory|accessdate= November 5, 2012|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes take place in several parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, Africa but mostly occur in the United States, Argentina, and Bangladesh.

===Hurricanes===
[[File:Hurricane Sandy Flooding Avenue C 2012.JPG|thumbnail| New York City after the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]]]]

'''[[Hurricane]]s''', [[cyclones]], [[tropical storms]] and [[typhoons]] can be referred to as the same. They combine low pressure and strong winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Tropical cyclones have a low pressure center, rain and strong winds. They usually initiate over tropical or subtropical waters. Hurricanes can be predicted several days before they hit and can be very destructive and destroy homes and some other buildings. Cyclones, although they are the same type of storm, are harder to predict before a few days like hurricanes thus giving people only a few hours of notice to evacuate their homes. In this case there are far more deaths from flooding and high tides. A recent (2012) example of a hurricane is [[Hurricane Sandy]], which was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States, leaving millions without power and a few homeless.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 30, 2012|title= Sandy death toll rises, millions without power in u.s|via= CBC News|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/10/30/us-hurricane-sandy-superstorm-damages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floods===
'''Floods''' take place when water overflows or submerges land that is usually parched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Floods |work=[[IFRC]] |date=November 5, 2012|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/definition-of-hazard/floods/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way is when rivers or streams overflow their banks. A floodplain is produced when water from a rivers spreads through the land from excessive rain, rapid ice melting, unfortunately placed beaver dam, and ruptured dam. There are two types of floods: general and flash floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Information, Flooding Facts, Flash Floods, Photos -- National Geographic. Environment Facts, Environment Science, Global Warming, Natural Disasters, Ecosystems, Green Living |website= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date= November 5, 2012|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/floods-profile/}}&lt;/ref&gt; General floods are predicted well in advance and usually cause the destruction of housing, people and crops. Flash floods come without warning and are sudden and extreme: A large volume of water flows rapidly and people have to make quick movements if they do not want to be caught in the flood. They have to find high safe ground where the water will not reach them.

===Earthquakes===
When two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past each other in the fault of the earth, it is called an earthquake.

The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the Earth. 90% of the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries.&lt;ref name="earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca"/&gt; Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.

==Technological hazards==
===Technical hazards===

[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Fukushima I [[Nuclear Power Plant]] after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Reactor 1 to 4 from left to right.]]
There are several technical hazards one should be aware of as they pose a threat humans and their values. These hazards are measured in terms of the risk they pose to the community using them. Technical hazards are classified by a source, specifically speaking; they can fall under automotive emissions, medical radiation, explosions and air pollution (environmental) hazards. The quality of the hazard determines the safety precautions that are taken. For example, hazards can be a risk to an individual or a risk to the population. If the population is at risk with the hazard, there will be more priorities for the management of the hazardous material. These hazardous materials can cause illness or even death to an individual if they are not address accordingly, so it is crucial for them to inform the public about these technical hazards.

===Nuclear and radiation (accidents/incidents)===
There are several thoughts that come to mind when one thinks of the word “nuclear”,&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url=http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}	&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be basic chemistry or highly complex explosives; nuclear accidents, nuclear incidences or nuclear terrorism are definitely a threat to the community or the world in that matter. But what is nuclear terrorism exactly? A "nuclear accident, incident, or act of terrorism is an unpredictable, unusual and unwanted event involving radiation and/or radioactive materials."&lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt; To specifically distinguish between the three, nuclear accidents are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. Nuclear incidents on the other hand are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref name="dceg.cancer.gov"/&gt;

===Nuclear accident===
'''Nuclear accidents''' are not deliberate and viewed as acts of nature. There are several examples of these nuclear accidents taken place around the world. To start off, a prime example of a [[nuclear accident]] would be [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|Palo mares B-52 Accident]]. On January 17, 1966, a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[B-52]] [[bomber]] collided with a mid-tanker airplane that was being refueled at 31000 feet. When the two airplanes collided, the tanker airplane exploded completely killing all crew members, while the B-52 bomber split in half killing a small proportion of the crew. When the airplane split in half, four bombs dropped from the sky. Two of them detonated, causing 2 kilometers of land to be contaminated by radioactive plutonium. The fourth explosive was recovered when it was discovered that it landed on the sea. The soil on the contaminated area had to be removed and placed in barrels, to reduce the amount of pollution having been caused by the nuclear explosive.

===Nuclear incident===
'''Nuclear incidents''' are causes that include deliberate actions but these are “generally non-malicious and non-violent; may be due to poor judgement [or] wrong information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first= S. |year=2011|title= Introduction to Nuclear/ Radiation Accidents, Incidents and Events. Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry course|url= http://dceg.cancer.gov/files/RadEpiCourse2011/Simon_Introduction-to-Radiation-Accidents_Incidents-and-Events_may19-2011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Secondary example would be the Johnston Atoll Incident that occurred on July 25, 1962. They decided to conduct the experiment at Christmas Island on Johnson Atoll, where they set off 36 nuclear explosions. One of the missile launches went wrong as it malfunctioned when trying to launch. The leaders decided to detonate the missile before it launched. When it detonated, the entire island was covered with radioactive plutonium. The witnesses claimed that 85% of the people suffered from [[radioactive contamination]] that created cancer and other radioactive related diseases. Plus those who were present at the site of the explosion suffered from infertility, and other body deformations.

==Sociological hazards==
Sociological hazards that create a disaster area are [[riots]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].

===Riot===
A riot is defined as a noisy, violent public disturbance caused by  a group or a crowd (three or more people) usually protesting against another group or government policy in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riot -  Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=November 1, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/riot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK London riot in August 2011, for example, was started due to the shooting of [[Mark Duggan]] by the London police.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuchs|first= C. |year=2012|title= Behind the News: Social Media, Riots and Revolution. Capital and Class, 36(3), 383-391|accessdate=November 1, 2012 |url=http://cnc.sagepub.com/content/36/3/383.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters came together destroying neighborhoods and streets violently damaging property to protest the police's actions that happened a few days prior.&lt;ref name="Fuchs" /&gt; Riots increase expenses to repair costly damages putting the city in distress.

===Terrorism===
[[File:North face south tower after plane strike 9-11.jpg|thumb|[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] burning down during the [[9/11 attacks]].]]

Terrorism is defined as acts of violence and threats by a group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/terrorism|title=terrorism|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorism occurs with an unexpected attack on [[non-combatants]] to create fear and panic having a detrimental consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorism. The American Heritage: New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition|date= November 5, 2012|website=www.dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrorist attacks]] create a massive, costly impact on the society. Not only is there large amount of property damage that may not be able to be repaired, there is also a large impact on citizens. People lose loved ones and suffer from their own health being impacted. The [[9/11|9/11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|twin towers]] in [[New York City]] marks one of the largest attacks on the United States.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1= H.|last2= Keenan|first2= K. |year=2012|title= The Impact of 9/11 on the Geography of Financial Services in New York.

People suffered from health problems from inhaling the sediments from the crumbling towers. The financial and social impact is still present thirteen years later in today's society.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; It is concluded that New York City still suffers from a post-disaster decline in financial services.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; New York City is a Disaster area due to the sociological hazard of terrorism.

===War===
War defined as a period where conflict is carried out as an act of hostility by [[armed forces]] between two or more nations or [[Civil war|within a nation]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/war war]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan, for example would be a sociological hazard causing disaster areas because it is considered a war zone. There has been an ongoing battle between United States and the Taliban in Afghanistan resulting in a war zone.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first= M. |year=2011|title=They were Hunting and Killing Us: Abc News' Mike Boettcher Caught in Taliban Firefight with U.S. Troops in Afghanistan|work= ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/abc-news-mike-boettcher-caught-taliban-firefight-us/story?id=13702376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant bombing and shooting marks up Afghanistan destructing property, land and causing threats to the civilians living in the area.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Thousands have died and international aid for the cost of the war is implemented through tax payers.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; There is lack of resources due to the war area cutting off access to areas because of violence and danger.

==Examples of modern disaster areas==
An example of a '''technological disaster''' was the Fukushima disaster which was caused by a “massive 8.9-magnitude earthquake [that] hit northeast Japan”.&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst Nuclear Accidents / Disasters in History|year=2011| accessdate=November 5, 2012|url= http://www.smashinglists.com/worst-nuclear-accidents-disasters-in-history/|website=www.smashinglists.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This earthquake caused a [[nuclear explosion]] at a power plant; five reactors were damaged, causing the plant to go into an emergency state. All this occurred because there was a technological error in the system that cut down the regular and emergency power, causing the five reactors to destabilize and explode. This significant nuclear event had a big impact on the public health, as the area suffered nuclear contamination. The contamination caused all the crops such as milk, water or vegetables unsafe to eat. Hence all food grown in that area was banned from being sold. People in the “surroundings were moved to safe shelters,”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt; and 3 people were affected by the radiation alone. Luckily, the “Japanese government [handled] the situation in the most efficient and amazing way that anyone can imagine.”&lt;ref name="smashinglists.com"/&gt;

A recent example of a disaster area caused by a '''natural hazard''' is [[Hurricane Sandy]] which hit October 27, 2012. It was the most devastating storm in decades hitting the United States. The storm killed about 50 people and many were also hit by falling trees. The hardest-hit state was New York, leaving millions without power and a few homeless. 

A disaster area caused by a '''sociological hazard''' would be the terrorist attack on [[September 11th, 2001]], in New York City. Two airplanes struck the Twin Towers, causing them to crumble, killing many people in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masud|first= E. |year=2006|title= What Really Happened on September 11 Remains a Mystery |work=The Wisdom Fund|accessdate= November 5, 2012 |url=http://www.twf.org/News/Y2002/0427-Mystery.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected attack harmed many people and had a detrimental impact on New York City.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''EgyptAir Flight 648''' was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens [[Ellinikon International Airport]] in Greece and [[Cairo International Airport]] in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a [[Boeing 737-200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 11241985 |publisher=Airdisaster.com |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085212/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by the terrorist organization [[Abu Nidal]]. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates – Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

The Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pallás and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre – The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi – Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta – a decision reversed too late – contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025130/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign body aspiration''' occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A foreign body in the bronchi usually causes a cough.

==Cause==
In one study, [[peanut]]s were the most common obstruction.&lt;ref name="pmid17728968"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yadav SP, Singh J, Aggarwal N, Goel A |title=Airway foreign bodies in children: experience of 132 cases |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=850–3 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17728968 |doi= |url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/4809/4809a10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to peanuts, hot dogs, and grapes, latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
If the person is awake and able to breathe often all that is requires is providing [[oxygen therapy|extra oxygen]] while the operating room is prepared for [[bronchoscopy]].&lt;ref name=APLS2011/&gt;

If a children less than one and is unable to breathe at all then five back blows followed by five chest thrusts should be done.&lt;ref name=APLS2011/&gt; In children over the age of one [[abdominal thrusts]] are recommended.&lt;ref name=APLS2011/&gt;

If this is not effective than [[bag mask ventilation]] is recommended.&lt;ref name=APLS2011/&gt; Next [[laryngoscopy]] can be tried to look and see if the foreign body can be removed.&lt;ref name=APLS2011/&gt; If the above is not effective than [[intubation]] or [[cricothyrotomy]] can be tried.&lt;ref name=APLS2011&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource APLS.|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781449695965|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

'''''Golden Checkerboard''''' (1965) is a book by [[Ed Ainsworth]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Edward Maddin Ainsworth worked for 35 years as a columnist, feature writer and editor for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Other books by him include ''Pot Luck'' (1940), ''Eagles Fly West'' (1946), ''California Jubilee'' (1948), ''Bill Magee's Western Barbecue Cookbook'' (1949), ''Death Cues the Pageant'' (1954) New York, Arcadia House {{oclc|3117808}}, ''Painters of the Desert'' (1961), ''Beckoning Desert'' (1962) Prentice-Hall {{oclc|64311285}}, ''The Cowboy in Art'' (1968) New York, World Publishing {{oclc|443225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its subject matter concerns the mid-20th century economic conditions of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] of [[Palm Springs, California]], and the history of the 99-year lease law which enabled them to commercially develop tribal owned lands. It focuses on Indio [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] Judge Hilton McCabe, who is described as "The Little White Father of the Indians of Palm Springs",&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainsworth|first=Ed |title=Golden Checkerboard|year=1965|publisher=Desert-Southwest|location=Palm Desert, CA|pages=195|lccn=66000811|oclc=4391736 
| asin = B001TC8PMI   }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|2 Intro by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Tom C. Clark|Tom Clark]]}} and recalls the steps taken by McCabe to set up [[conservatorships]] and leases that would give the tribe investment opportunities and economic self-sufficiency. The title of the book refers to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' [[Indian Reservation|reservation]] [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard pattern]], originating from [[Land grants#United States|land grants]] to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] as an incentive to build rail lines through the region,&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|29}} when President Ulysses S. Grant signed an Executive Order granting "San Bernardino Base and Meridian, Township 4 South, Range 4 East, Section 14" to the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|49}}

==Historical context==
Section 14, which included the warm springs at the center of Palm Springs, and other sections surrounding Palm Springs, were "owned" by the Indians, but held "in trust" by the federal government; the Indians charged fees for bathing in the springs and picnicking in the canyon.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Chris|title=African-Americans Shaping the California Desert: Coachella Valley|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/african-americans-shaping-the-california-desert-coachella-valley.html|work=SOCAL Focus|publisher=KCET (Community Television of Southern California)|accessdate=March 19, 2012|date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Congress passed the Allotment Act (39 Stat. 969, 976)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact the original General Allotment Act was the [[Dawes Act]], passed in 1887. [http://www.mydesert.com/article/20120319/NEWS06/203190334/Q-Agua-Caliente-Tribal-Chairman-Richard-Milanovich?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFrontpage "Q&amp;A with Agua Caliente Tribal Chairman Richard Milanovich". ''Desert Sun''. March 19, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; which directed the Secretary of the Interior to divide and distribute the Indian land; Harry E. Wadsworth was appointed as the allotting agent.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|65}} In 1927, the Secretary instructed Wadsworth to make a new schedule of allotments, which he did for the 24 members of the Band who made written applications.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|67}} (In fact the allotments were not carried out; Band member Lee Arenas sued the federal government to have the allotments made legal and won his case in the United States Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accmuseum.org/Arenas-Street Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Lee Arenas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Arenas v.

Chief Francisco Patencio was active in opposing the allotments and loss of tribal authority, traveling to Washington, D.C., to meet with Office of Indian Affairs Commissioner John Collier. [http://www.accmuseum.org/Patencio-Road Aqua Caliente Cultural Museum: Francisco Patencio]&lt;/ref&gt;) In December 1944, Secretary of the Interior [[Oscar L. Chapman|Oscar Chapman]], acting on the advice of Commissioner of Indian Affairs [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], disapproved the allotting schedule set up by Wadsworth 17 years earlier.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|86}}

==Conservatorship program==

===Odlum Report===
In January 1953, [[Douglas McKay]] became [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Thereafter McKay asked industrialist [[Floyd B. Odlum]] (former president of Atlas Corp. and husband of [[Jacqueline Cochran]]) to investigate the affairs of the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|124}} The report by Odlum's committee was completed in April 1955 and put into final form in April 1956. Among other things, Odlum's report determined: that the Band consisted of 83 persons, the majority of whom were minors; the value of the Indian land, allotted and unallotted, totaled as much as $12,000,000; and the value of the land could increase with proper development. Odlum also discussed the legal problems related to unequal allotments, taxes on non-productive real estate, the inability to lease land because of a 5-year limit, and conflicting claims of the allottees.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|127–8}} The report recommended that the Indian land be placed in a private corporation or trusteeship rather than existing wardship.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|129–30}} Odlum's recommendations were not implemented because newly elected Congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]], who ran against Cochran in a bitter election campaign, blocked proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|132}} In the meantime, Congress passed Public Law No. 255 in August 1955, which allowed for leases of 50 years.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|138}}

===1959 legislation===&lt;!--subject to more editing. McCabe's papers (which are referenced below) are not readily available. Ainsworth's book is poorly organized, lacking an index or TOC. The "landmark decision" is probably related to the Equalization Act.--&gt;
In 1959, a landmark decision by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] equalized allotted Indian lands, thereby setting the stage for development of Indian lands within the city of Palm Springs. This same legislation, however, recognizing the potential value of Indian lands within the boundaries of a world-famous resort, also called for the appointment of conservators and guardians to "protect" Indians and their estates from "artful and designing persons"&lt;ref name="LandProblems"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0018 USC Libraries; Archival Collections: Judge Hilton McCabe Collection on the Agua Caliente Indians] containing unpublished manuscript of ''Land Problems and Solutions of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians'' (1961), Hilton McCabe, Indio Superior Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/usc_dml_rare_books_and_manuscripts USC Doheny Memorial Library: Rare Books and Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; who might otherwise cheat them out of their properties, which could now be legally sold by the individual tribal members who owned them. By declaring Indians as "incompetent" (both as children and adults) court-appointed conservators and guardians took control of a majority of Indian estates. A major oversight of the program was the appointment of judges, lawyers, and business people as Indian conservators and guardians—the very people the program sought to protect Indians and their estates from. The program was administered by the Indio Superior Court's Judge Hilton McCabe, subject of ''Golden Checkerboard''. McCabe concurrently acted as a conservator to a number of tribal members and an [[executor]], in addition to his administrative and legal roles.&lt;ref name="CoxReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Guardianships and Conservatorships Established for Members of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, California|date=March 1968|publisher=Department of the Interior|location=Washington, DC|pages=56|url=|author=Palm Springs Task Force (Cox Report)|oclc=8536472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As a result of the conservatorship program the Band was able to lease land to businesses. The Spa Hotel opened in November 1962, with Eileen Miguel, head of the Band, U.S. Grant IV, great-grandson of President Grant, and McCabe at the opening ceremony. In 1961, 41 members of the Band signed a petition to McCabe thanking him for his efforts. {{Cite book

With the ability to control Indian estates, the [[conservatorship]] program fostered corruption among the conservators and administrators—a series of [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service|Pulitzer Prize]] ([[1968 Pulitzer Prize|1968]]) winning ''[[The Press-Enterprise (California)|Riverside Press-Enterprise]]'' articles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1968 The Pulitzer Prizes: 1968 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; authored by journalist [[George Ringwald]] exposed such instances of excessive fees, fee-splitting, and other types of questionable conduct.&lt;ref name="AguaCaliente"&gt;{{cite book| last=Ringwald |first=George|title=The Agua Caliente Indians and Their Guardians|location=Riverside, CA|publisher=Press-Enterprise|year=1968|oclc=14015139|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatorship program was officially ended in 1968 after the Secretary of the Interior's Palm Springs Task Force similarly exposed it as fraudulent and corrupt.&lt;ref name="CoxReport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AguaCaliente" /&gt;{{check|date=June 2013}}

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

'''Human response to [[disaster]]s''' has been recorded throughout human history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions.

The term "disaster myth" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, “Psychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,” ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', 43 (2013): 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Aptekar, ''Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective'' (New York: G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect [[disaster response|disaster planning and response]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panic/Scared ==
One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a [[disaster]].  In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when experiencing the increased stress from an [[earthquake]], since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation.  Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place.  The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Disaster]]s also draw people to the area.  Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public and organizations involved in [[emergency management|emergency planning, management, and response]] all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Panic]]king can cause harm to others if people flee without thought.  Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the [[disaster|disaster’s]] damage and destruction.  When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the [[disaster]].  It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins.  By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed [[panic]], officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical [[panic]], officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of [[disaster]]s (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles’ [[The War of the Worlds]] radio broadcast in 1938, the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire]], and as [[Hurricane Carla]] approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational behavior also dominated after [[earthquake]]s in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite many reports of widespread [[panic]], evidence later proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the [[flood]]ing of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived [[panic]] among the population.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shock ==
Many people believe those who experience a [[disaster]] firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought the initial devastation of the [[disaster]] leaves people too fragile and in [[Acute stress reaction|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts.  They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true.  And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived.  What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the [[disaster]] and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[disaster]] can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Ville de Goyet, “Stop Propagating Disaster Myths,” ''The Lancet'', 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who went through the [[disaster]] are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency.  They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches).  If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance.  People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance.  This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies.  Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

People’s reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado|1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan]], the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, [[Hurricane Audrey]] in 1957, [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961, [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|Mexico City in 1985]] and in [[1999 Izmit earthquake|Turkey in 1999]], thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance ==
People believe the population impacted by a [[disaster]] are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering.  Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately.  This myth is especially pervasive when the [[disaster]] strikes a third-world country and it is a “superior” western country coming to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762-763.&lt;/ref&gt;

While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a [[disaster]], most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs.  In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves.  As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts.  Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this myth’s impact was seen following the [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake]] as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a [[disaster]].  They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks.  Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people’s homes.  Clothing is rarely needed.  Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities.  Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations.  And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first.  As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
The prevalence of [[looting]] in the wake of [[disaster]]s is another common myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that [[disaster]]s provide cover for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  People believe criminals will use the [[disaster]] as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[looting]] can occur, they are always isolated incidents.  And much reported [[looting]] is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

But because people believe [[looting]] happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster’s destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  When no [[looting]] occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of connection between [[disaster]]s and [[looting]] was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth’s impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake]] out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morale ==
People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high [[morale]] in a disaster’s aftermath.  They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need.  Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors.  They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner.  This can cause survivors to resent outsiders.  This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
When a [[disaster]] results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a [[disease]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also believe [[epidemic|disease epidemics]] develop in the wake of [[disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they died from the [[disaster]] does not make them a risk for spreading [[disease]]s.  If a body does carry a [[infection|communicable disease]], the person already had it when he or she was alive.  The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  And an [[epidemic]] would happen only if either of two circumstances exist:  1) the [[disaster]] brings [[disease]] with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster’s effects lead to [[malnutrition]], the [[malnutrition]] increases susceptibility to [[disease]], and finally, a large number of people contract the [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin.  This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones.  In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear or rumor of an [[epidemic]] can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth has been repeated many times such as in the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua]], [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, the [[1999 Izmit earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]], and the [[2000 Mozambique flood|2000 flooding in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, rumors of [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhus]] that were later proven to be false followed the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake in Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuation of myths ==
[[File:Hydra1.gif|thumb|Myths Live On]]

=== By people ===
People who have experienced a [[disaster]] often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering.  It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic.  In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster survivors tend to worry about [[looting]].  Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not.  While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced [[looting]], many claim of being aware of it elsewhere.  The belief in [[looting]] can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the [[disaster]] may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By organizations ===
Government agencies, civilian organizations, and [[first responder]]s all believe to some extent in disaster myths.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their [[disaster response|planning and response]] to [[disaster]]s, victims, and survivors.  And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 2269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a [[disaster]] and up until official numbers are compiled.  During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property.  This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers.  If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site’s community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed.  One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide.  They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster.  And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors’ irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media.  In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see.  An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Goltz, "Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery," ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2'', no. 3 (1984): 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent [[looting]] even if they have taken no action on the issue.  If the norm happens and little to no [[looting]] occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime.  But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the [[looting]].  Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By media ===
Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely due to the way they portray [[disaster]]s.  In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding [[disaster]]s and survivor behavior on what they see in the media.  The media strives to keep their viewers’ and readers’ attention for as long as possible.  Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting.  Immediately after the [[disaster]], they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the [[disaster]] as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of its manner in covering [[disaster]]s, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of media coverage centers on [[emergency management]] organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of [[disaster]]s occurring outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming [[disaster]] such as a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of [[looting]] coming out of [[Japan]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan Disaster in 2011]], they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave.  By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)
*[[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]], between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (1904–1906)
*[[Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908]], between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* [[Bosnian crisis]] (1908–1909)
* [[Agadir Crisis]] (1911)
* [[Åland crisis]] (1916–1920)
* [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] (1936)
* [[Anschluss]] (1938)
* [[May Crisis 1938|May Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Iran crisis of 1946|Iran crisis]] (1946–1947)
* [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949)
* [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962)
* [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' incident]] (1968)
* [[Sino-Soviet border conflict#Border conflict of 1969|Damansky Island Crisis]] (1969)
* [[1973 Chilean coup]]
* [[Axe Murder Incident]] (1976)
* [[Beagle conflict]] (1978)
* [[Iran hostage crisis]] (1979)
* [[:es:Crisis de la Corbeta Caldas|Caldas' crisis]] (1987)

* [[September 11 attacks]] (2001)
* [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]] (2001)
* [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] (2008)
* [[Korean crisis]] (2013)

==Ongoing crises==
*[[World hunger]]
*[[Poverty]]
*[[Global warming]]

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tour dates and features==
The intended tour itinerary was as follows:

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Today, the movement has grown into a network of 113 countries. All together, 14 million participants have been engaged in movement's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalev Leetaru: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/07/30/how-pokemon-and-location-based-augmented-reality-could-save-the-planet/#4f804c9766cc "How Pokémon And Location-Based Augmented Reality Could Save The Planet"] Forbes, 2016-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Do It! World is an accredited member of the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]].

Since 2017, the movement uses [[W sign]] aka Three Fingers Up as a symbol. 

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup 2012==
In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world. Each group or organisation was leading the cleanup action in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/countries |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==
[[File:Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015.jpg|thumb|Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015]]
The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

In 2013, 375,000 cleaned up the country in '''Bulgaria''' in a one-day country cleanup action (13,9% of country's population).

In 2012, 210,000 people (10% of country's population) cleaned up '''Latvia''' from illegal waste in just one day.

In 2013, a massive civic cleanup action also took place in '''Kosovo''', bringing together 132,000 people (7% of the population) and in the same year, Albania also had a massive cleanup action, uniting 147,000 people (5,25%) to clean up the country in just one day.

In 2015, 250,000 people (8,6% of country's population) cleaned up '''Lithuania''' from illegal waste in one day.

In 2015, over 500,000 people participated in Let's Do It! actions in '''Ukraine''' cleaning up illegal dump-sites around the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

A helicopter [[prison escape]] is made when an inmate escapes from a [[prison]] by means of a [[helicopter]]. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.

One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eliot Asinof| authorlink = | title = The 10-Second Jailbreak: The helicopter escape of Joel David Kaplan|edition= 1973|page= 268 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1st edition| isbn= 0-03-001011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.&lt;ref name="aiton_2005"/&gt; One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter.  Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer [[Pascal Payet]], who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.&lt;ref name="Grasse"&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6899274.stm | title = French inmate in second breakout | publisher = BBC News| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another multiple helicopter escapee is [[Vasilis Paleokostas]] who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the [[Korydallos Prison|same prison]].&lt;ref name="korydallos"/&gt; Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.&lt;ref name="Blade_1988"&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|title= 3 Escapes caught after copter chase|first= |last=AP |authorlink=Associated Press |author2= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |format= |newspaper= [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date= Jul 12, 1988 |page= |pages=Cover and p.7 |at= |accessdate= June 8, 2014 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |archivedate=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 he was convicted of killing his New York business partner, Louis Melchior Vidal, Jr., in [[Mexico City]].  Kaplan always maintained his innocence and on August 19, 1971, a helicopter landed in the Santa Martha Acatitla prison yard where he made his escape accompanied by Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro, a [[Venezuela]]n counterfeiter. Both men were flown to the United States and then different planes flew Kaplan to [[California]] and Castro to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  The escape is told in a book, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"/&gt; It also inspired the 1975 movie ''[[Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout]]'', which starred [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard, where her boyfriend (awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge) was set to escape. The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.

The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds.

|The chartered helicopter&amp;nbsp;— carrying two armed passengers, a pilot and a technician&amp;nbsp;— first tried to rip off the chicken-wire fence surrounding Trikala prison with a hook dangling from a rope. But that didn't work, so a rope was lowered down to whisk away Panagiotis Vlastos. Another prisoner, an unnamed Albanian national also in the courtyard at the time, may also have been part of the escape plan.

At the same time, the armed passengers used AK47 assault rifles and Uzi submachine gun to fire on the prison guards.  One guard, who was inside a post, was slightly injured by shards of flying glass. He and others returned fire, injuring Vlastos, who had managed to climb into the helicopter, as well as the helicopter's technician. Vlastos fell from a height of about 3 meters (10 feet) into the courtyard, and the helicopter was eventually grounded in the parking lot.

Prison officials told TV stations Mega and NET that they recovered well over 500 bullets fired from the helicopter. The Ministry of Justice, in statements describing the escape attempt, added that the helicopter passengers also carried, but did not use, "improvised explosive devices."

|Pola Roupa&lt;br /&gt;Nikos Maziotis
|A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison.  
In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014.
According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis’ wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers.
Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helicopter pilot foils hijack attempt, part of an escape plan for convicted terrorist|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/12946/Helicopter-pilot-foils-hijack-attempt--part-of-an-escape-plan-for-convicted-terrorist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and official line-up ==
Originally, it was supposed to be a Brazilian version of the famous German [[Wacken Open Air]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; From that moment on, several bands, including [[Shaman (Brazilian band)|Shaman]], [[Megadeth]], [[Symphony X]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],&lt;ref name="vírgula"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sem shows nem estrutura, Metal Open Air é cancelado|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/festivais-de-musica/2012/04/21/298723-sem-shows-nem-estrutura-metal-open-air-e-cancelado|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|Vírgula]]|date=21 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including [[Shadowside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salzano Jr|first=Costábile|title=Metal Open Air: Shadowside cancela participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/147389-krisiun.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=3 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krisiun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Krisiun cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_840/152194-metalopenair.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=12 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volbeat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Volbeat cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_843/146543-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=23 January 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly for logistical reasons.

By February/March 2012, the official announced line-up was as follows (act names in '''bold''' are headliners; El Diablo is an entertainment group that prepared rock night parties after every headliner performance):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: anunciada a programação oficial do evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/148537-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=17 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headliners of the second day, the [[Rock and Roll All Stars]], were a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of [[Gene Simmons]], [[Joe Elliott]], [[Matt Sorum]], [[Duff McKagan]] , [[Gilby Clarke]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ed Roland]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Mike Inez]], [[Billy Duffy]] and [[Charlie Sheen]], who was to be the festival's [[master of ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Sheen convida para o Metal Open Air, que ocorre a partir de 20 de abril no Maranhão|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2012/04/09/charlie-sheen-convida-para-o-metal-open-air-que-ocorre-a-partir-de-20-de-abril-no-maranhao.jhtm|publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Paulo|language=Portuguese|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival and the cancellations ==
[[File:Symphony x 2004.tiff|thumb|right|220px|[[Michael Romeo]] (left) and [[Russell Allen]] (right); Symphony X was among the very few bands that managed to make a performance at the festival.]]

Shortly before and even during the festival, several bands cancelled their performances. British thrash band Venom, for example, had their [[Visa (document)|visas]] sent to Africa instead of Brazil by mistake,&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; thus making it impossible for them to take part of MOA and two other South American festivals. [[Hansi Kürsch]], vocalist for German power metal quartet Blind Guardian, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air 2012 performance cancelled|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/04/21/metal-open-air-2012-performance-cancelled/|publisher=Official Blind Guardian website|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|date=21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In 25 years of our career we [...] have been extremely successful in the avoidance of cancelled shows, so far. This unfortunately comes to a very sad end here in São Luís. Due to massive technical and administrative problems we were forced to cancel tonight's show. As far as we understand it seems to be the local management who has not been able to secure a proper festival environment, anymore. Things are pretty out of hand there. We feel very sorry about this totally unsatisfying situation, but the mistakes made by the local promoter makes an even improvised show impossible. [...] In the future we will be more careful in confirming such festivals.''}}

[[Aquiles Priester]], from Hangar, also cancelled his band's participation, stating:&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

{{cquote|''We negotiated everything via oral conversation, but we made ourselves very much clear that we needed the total cash before our performance, since we needed to pay our trip to São Luís in our very own bus. We wouldn't accept, by any means, to play without our backline. So far, we were paid with only 25% of the cash to cover all our expenses (fuel, accommodation and food for the band and crew), we needed at least 75%.''}}

Terra Prima's members didn't receive their air tickets to São Luís nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

Symphony X, one of the few bands that managed to take on the stage and perform, posted a note some days later, thanking their fans for the show and criticizing the event's structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air|url=http://www.symphonyx.com/site/news/metal-open-air/|publisher=Official Symphony X website|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''We want to thank the fans for sticking it out on Friday night! We were extremely close to having to cancel the show due to technical reasons and did not know if we would even play for sure until an hour before the set, which had already been delayed two hours. The lack of organization and chaos surrounding the event, which had also been noted by the media, had forced many bands to cancel. This is unfair to the fans in attendance, and unfortunately these fans were robbed of many performances.''}}

[[Dave Mustaine]], from Megadeth, also thanked his fans and regretted the festival's organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megadeth Mainman On Brazil's METAL OPEN AIR: 'We Were Playing For The People'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=172916|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''To the fans last night in São Luís, thank you. It's all I can say. One Big Mega Thank You! Yesterday's show in Sao Luis was very challenging, but we did it! [...] I was told a lot of the talent opted out from coming. I was also told the tickets cost $450 [[Brazilian real]] for the three-day weekend, and $250 BRL for just one day. The average person in this area makes $28 BRL a day, so you can do the math. [...] We were playing, no matter what. We weren't playing for the promoter anymore; we were playing for the people!''}}

[[Ricardo Confessori]], drummer for [[Shaman]], publicly contested Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] for canceling the band's performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for  the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was "the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Scott_Ian/status/193877446603448320 Confessori's and Ian's discussion] at [[Twitter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; As for the fans, some had to camp inside [[stable]]s, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freire|first=Pedro Henrique|title=Estábulos para cavalos viram área de camping para o público|url=http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml|publisher=O Imparcial|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=20 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524014607/http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml#|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbosa|first=Alex|title=

'''Pete Lawrence''' is a conceptualist, social entrepreneur, recording artist, DJ, event organiser, music programmer writer and broadcaster based in the UK.

==Background==

Lawrence created the concept for [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill]] in February 1994, originally as a new type of Sunday multimedia club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.petelawrence.net/the_big_chill|title=The Big Chill|newspaper=Pete Lawrence|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his partner at the time, Katrina Larkin, he put together an event at which people were able to network and enjoy an experimental, audio-visual environment, as part of a multi-faceted eight-hour event. It was the first London club to have its own website and to offer free internet access and was initially noted for its ambient and downtempo soundtrack, contributing to the development of the chill out’ boom at the turn of the Millennium.

This “festival in a club” concept adapted relatively easily to an outdoors setting and in 1995 Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin staged the first Big Chill Festival, reaching a capacity of 35,000 by 2007 as one of the top UK festivals. He was also instrumental in taking The Big Chill concept to several locations worldwide in collaboration with The [[British Council]].

Lawrence was also involved in The Big Chill's expansion into opening London venues. The Big Chill Bar in Brick Lane, was followed in autumn 2006 with the three story Big Chill House in Kings Cross as well as releasing his own recording project [[Chilled By Nature]]. It included a number of EPs, one-off tracks and collaborations, live performances at The Big Chill festival, and the debut album ''Under One Sun''.

In the mid 80s, he established the [[Cooking Vinyl]] label and recorded 'The Texas Campfire Tapes' with singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked which went to No 1 in the UK Independent album charts. He co-edited the book ''Crossfade - a Big Chill Anthology'' (Serpents Tail). In December 2007, Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin were voted into Time Out's Top 100 ‘movers and shakers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/Pete-Lawrence|title=Pete Lawrence - Virtual Festivals|last=Jasinski|first=Mr|newspaper=Virtual Festivals|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence stood down as a director and shareholder of Chillfest (The Big Chill) in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/09/pete-lawrence-big-chill|title=My greatest mistake: Pete Lawrence|last=Snowdon|first=Graham|date=2010-10-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Lawrence's new project [https://campfireconvention.uk Campfire Convention] launched as a social network and membership based events community. Campfire's aims include :
Building a social movement around values, bringing people together to find common ground, real life meet ups, connections and conversations : campaigning, initiatives and engagement at local level via Campfire Beacons, building resources for reference and activism, pioneering a new journalistic media voice, creating new models for a post-capitalist world which reward engagement and global cultural exchange.

Campfire's first outdoor Convention was in August 2016 in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire which included keynote addresses from their patron Brian Eno and peace activist Scilla Elworthy as well as panels, thinkshops, music, art and yoga.

The '''Solomon curve''' is a [[graphical representation]] of the collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed compared to the average vehicle speed on the same road. The curve was based on [[research]] conducted by David Solomon in the late 1950s and published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Solomon | title=Accidents on main rural highways related to speed, driver, and vehicle | date=July 1964, Reprinted 1974 | publisher=Technical report, U.S. Department of Commerce/Bureau of Public Roads (precursor to Federal Highway Administration)| work = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research suggests significant biases in the Solomon study, which may cast doubt on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original research ==
In 1964, Solomon researched the relationship between [[average]] [[speed]] and the [[collision]] [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] of [[automobile]]s and plotted the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Meyer | first = John Robert | authorlink = |author2=José A.

== Subsequent research ==
In 1968, Julie Cirillo conducted a similar study of 2,000 vehicles on interstate highways that addressed speed variation’s impact on crashes that involved two or more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cirillo |first=J. A.|title = Interstate System Accident Research Study II, Interim Report II, Public Roads, 35 (3) |year = 1968|pages = 71–75 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cirillo data produced a U-shaped curve similar to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cost-Benefit Evaluation of Large Truck- Automobile Speed Limit Differentials on Rural Interstate Highways|journal=University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering|date=November 2005|first=Steven L.|last=Johnson|author2=Naveen Pawar|volume=|issue=|pages=Page 25|id=|url=http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|format=MS Word|accessdate=2009-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051900/http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Research Triangle Institute]] conducted a study in 1970 where data was collected on 114 crashes involving 216 vehicles on a state highway in Indiana to address these concerns by (1) combining automated, embedded speed-monitoring stations with trained on-scene crash investigators, and (2) distinguishing data on vehicles slowing to negotiate a turn from vehicles moving slowly in the flow of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Research Triangle Institute, "Speed and Accident, Volume II," Report No. FH-11-6965, National Highway Safety Bureau, June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on these results in 1971, academics West and Dunn confirmed the findings of Solomon and Cirillo,&lt;ref name="Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.its.pdx.edu/speedlimits/final%20interstate%20speed%20review%20report%20(9.12).pdf | title=Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits | accessdate=3-1-2009 | author=Monsere, C.

L., and Milliken, C. | date=September 2004 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H4UFKRFH?url=http://www.its.pdx.edu/speedlimits/final%20interstate%20speed%20review%20report%20%289.12%29.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but found that crashes involving turning vehicles accounted for 44 percent of all crashes observed in the study and that excluding these crashes from the analysis greatly attenuated the factors that created the U-shape of the Solomon curve.&lt;ref&gt;West, L. B., Jr. and Dunn, J. W. (1971). "Accidents, Speed Deviation and Speed Limits." Traffic Engineering. 41 (10), 52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Fildes, Rumbold, and Leening collected self-reported crash data from 707 motorists in Australia with fewer than 200 reporting that they had been in a collision but, unlike Solomon and Cirillo, the researchers found no relationship between slower speeds and increased crash involvement.&lt;ref name="Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc016.html | title=Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding | accessdate=3-2-2009 |vauthors=Fildes BN, Rumbold G, Leening A | date=June 1991 | location = Monash University Accident Research Centre, Victoria Australia, | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the many studies over the years, in testimony before the Ohio Senate Highways and Transportation Committee on June 10, 2003, Julie Cirillo, Former Assistant Administrator and Chief Safety Officer for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ([[FMCSA]]), testified that "up to the present time there has been no evidence to alter Solomon’s original finding that variance from the mean operating speed is a major contributor to accidents".&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003"&gt;{{cite news|title=Testimony of Julie Anna Cirillo |date=2003-06-10 |publisher=OOIDA |url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |work=Land Line Magazine |pages= |accessdate=2009-03-02 |language= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816035301/http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Kloeden CN, Ponte G and McLean AJ of the Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University quantified the relationship, "... between free travelling speed and the risk of involvement in a casualty crash in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia" using a case control study design. They found, "..the risk of involvement in a casualty crash increased more than exponentially with increasing free travelling speed above the mean traffic speed and that travelling speeds below the mean traffic speed were associated with a lower risk of being involved in a casualty crash." Outlining past research in this area, they suggest that, in the Solomon research, "Both the numerator (number of crashes in a particular speed band) and the denominator (number of vehicle-miles travelled in that same speed band) may have been quite inaccurate for relatively low speeds." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical foundation ==
Hauer provided a theoretical foundation for the Solomon curve in 1971—“for example, if I drive at 45 mph, while the [[median]] of the pack is 60 mph, how many cars will pass me in an hour and hence have a chance to collide with me?”—that showed that the theoretical [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] was nearly identical to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref name="Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFhkehz-Ky0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=%22The+Solomon+Curve%22 | title=Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy | accessdate=3-1-2009 |author1=John Robert Meyer |author2=José A. Gómez-Ibáñez |author3=William B. Tye |author4=Clifford Winston | pages=Page 276 | isbn=978-0-8157-3181-8 | date=1999-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implications ==
While Solomon’s research focused on speed deviation, and not speed per se, some commentators have cited Solomon’s research to support the conclusion that raw speed and crash risk are not directly related.&lt;ref name="Is speed killing us?"/&gt; On the other hand, while recognizing Solomon's research reveals the importance to safety of variability around average speed, Leonard Evans concludes in ''[[Traffic Safety and the Driver]]'' that control of absolute driver speed, and not variability, should be the primary focus of traffic safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Leonard| title = Traffic Safety and the Driver | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | year = 1991 | location = New York, New York | pages = 155–56 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=OyuGJJ6rKQ0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=%22Traffic+Safety+and+the+Driver%22+Solomon| isbn = 0-442-00163-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both views support the fact that the seminal research underlying the Solomon curve shows that the greater the difference between a driver’s speed and the average speed of traffic—both above and below that average speed—the greater the likelihood of involvement in a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Transportation Research Board | first = Committee for Guidance on Setting and Enforcing Speed Limits | title = Managing Speed | publisher = National Research Council (U.S.) | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pARs53U6NAQC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22drive+with+the+flow+of+traffic”+Solomon | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-309-06502-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many states and safety organizations advise drivers to “drive with the flow of traffic”.&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003" /&gt;

'''The Fifth Column Podcast''' is an American politics, news and humor podcast founded in April, 2016.  The show is hosted by [[Kmele Foster]], with co-hosts [[Michael C. Moynihan]], [[Matt Welch]] and produced by contributor [https://www.anthonylfisher.com/ Anthony L. Fisher] and Daniel Bier.  The podcast is described as in each episode as an “...almost weekly thoughtful commentary on the news, those who make it and occasionally ourselves”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wethefifth.com/episodes/2018/3/12/stormy-social-media-q-mdf8t-gwmfc-mlw4s-dlwdt-xxtzd-psbc3-xmyrf-6ml8a-bgcn4-ns82z-ny8yb-ww44l-sr9ce-2zhfh-3zbfs-ez68r-zsjyw-ymsts-glnfc-p77pw-mwa47-hb2fy-85b74|title=116 w/ Harry Siegel "Soros' Paid Protest Mobs, Team Woke vs Team Resentment"|last=|first=|date=|website=wethefifth.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The show is closely associated with independent-leaning, libertarian and anarcho-capitalist ideology as presented by the show hosts and guests, but is not explicitly so. 

=== Background and Format ===
'''[http://wethefifth.com/ The Fifth Column Podcast]''' first aired on iTunes April 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - iTunes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show markets itself as “Analysis. Commentary. Sedition” on Instagram&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/we.the.fifth/|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - Instagram|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as “@MattWelch @mcmoynihan @Kmele pick apart the news, interrogate their guests and question just about everything #someidiotwrotethis” on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wethefifth|title=wethefifth - Twitter|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The introduction to the podcast typically describes itself as:  “…your almost weekly rhetorical assault on the news cycle, the people who make it and occasionally ourselves…”.  Credit for the shows creation has been attributed to the encouragement of [[Kennedy (commentator)|Kennedy]] (Lisa Kennedy Montgomery) and her husband Dave Lee, who are associates of the hosts.  The name of the podcast has been attributed to a suggestion by [[Katherine Mangu-Ward]] as revealed in Episode 13 (3:05 mark)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title="Islamic [REDACTED] and OJ Simpson"|last=|first=|date=June 21, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The original music that opens and closes the podcast includes a soundbite of F.D.R.’s speech given 1940/05/27 warning prejudices exploited by Fifth [[iarchive:1940-05-27_FDR_Warns_of_Fifth_Column|Columnists]].

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous film and album==
{{Further|Michael Jackson's This Is It|Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)}}

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.  Some of the music and vocals in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="This Is It Worldwide Release Dates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |title=This Is It Worldwide Release Dates |work=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures.com]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214515/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accompanying album to the film was also released.

''For the geographical place see [[Tonto Basin]]

'''''Tonto Basin''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''Tonto Basin'' is the original version of the shorter novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To The Last Man]]'' (1921). Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]] and [[Characterisation|character development]]. This shorter version was published as a [[book]] by [[Harper Brothers]] in 1921.

==Plot introduction==
A story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his.

Jean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can’t get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen’s honor and believes the best of her.

The feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box cañon.

Jean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared.

When she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler.

The story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other.

==Themes==
The book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud.

The feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead.

Ellen grows from a naïve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.

==Publication==
In the early 1990s, [[Jon Tuska]], was researching the [[filmography]] of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that ''[[Last of the Duanes (novel)|Last of the Duanes]]'' and ''[[Rangers of the Lone Star]]'' were much altered from the [[holograph]] found "in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.".&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 8. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused him to request that they "tell me of any other manuscripts...that had  met a similar fate."&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 9. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the discovery of the complete holographic [[manuscript]] of the novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To the Last Man]]''. A comparison of the holograph with ''To the Last Man'' revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">[[File:Lockerbie disaster memorial.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A memorial is often established to remember lives lost in a tragedy such as the [[Lockerbie air disaster]]]]
A '''tragedy''' is an event of great loss, usually of human life.  Such an event is said to be ''tragic''. Traditionally the event would require "some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements"&lt;ref&gt;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&amp;slug=1484688&lt;/ref&gt; to be tragic.

Not all death is considered a tragedy. Rather it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crisis Intervention Training for Disaster Workers: An Introduction |last=Doherty |first=George W. |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=12 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of factors that define a death as ''tragic''.

An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tragedy does not necessarily involve [[massacre|massive death]]. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt; The person need not necessarily have been [[celebrity|famous]] before death.

==Factors that make death a tragedy==
Generally, the label of "tragedy" is given to an event based on public perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=11 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy.

===Scope===
The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a [[recidivism|recidivist]] prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1 /&gt;

===Prematurity===
A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic.&lt;ref name=Lattanzi1/&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Publicity]] is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=3 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with public tragedy |last=Lattanzi-Licht |first=Marcia E. |authorlink= |author2=Kenneth J. Doka  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=8 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasting effects===
The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; {{ISBN|978-1-59473-240-9}}; page 67&lt;/ref&gt; A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional, and National Tragedy |last=Roberts |first=Stephen B.  |authorlink= |author2=Willard W. C. Ashley  |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-59473-240-9 |page=86 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with tragedy==
There are various ways tragedy can affect people.

The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy [[grief]], followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include [[sadness]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[crying]], [[blame]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy: A psychiatrist offers ways to deal with trauma and grief |author=Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D. |newspaper=Ebony Magazine |date=February 1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=coping+with+tragedy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jUT4TIfBFIWClAe0rvGgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coping%20with%20tragedy&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coping with Tragedy |last=Ramsey |first=Tara |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=33 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, their [[religion|faith]] may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith in the Fast Lane |last=Owens |first=Ken |authorlink= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=106 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''UFC Fight Night: Blaydes vs. Ngannou 2''''' (also known as '''''UFC Fight Night 141''''') is an upcoming [[mixed martial arts]] event produced by the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] that will be held on November 24, 2018 at  [[Cadillac Arena]] in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name="FNBeijing"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/8/5/17652994/ufc-to-debut-in-beijing-on-nov-24|title=UFC to debut in Beijing on Nov. 25|publisher=mmafighting.com|author=Newswire|date=2018-08-05|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The event will mark the promotion's first visit to Beijing. The UFC previously visited [[Mainland China]] for [[UFC Fight Night: Bisping vs. Gastelum]] in November 2017.

A heavyweight rematch between former [[UFC Heavyweight Championship]] challenger [[Francis Ngannou]] and [[Curtis Blaydes]] is expected to serve as the event headliner.&lt;ref name="BeijingME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/24393887/beijing|title=UFC heavyweights Francis Ngannou, Curtis Blaydes to meet in Beijing|publisher=espn.com|author=Ariel Helwani|date=2018-08-16|accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pairing met previously in April 2016 at [[UFC Fight Night: Rothwell vs. dos Santos]], with Ngannou winning the fight via TKO stoppage at the conclusion of the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-francis-ngannou-beats-curtis-blaydes-after-nasty-eye-injury-stops-the-fight-041016|title=Francis Ngannou beats Curtis Blaydes after nasty eye injury stops the fight|publisher=foxsports.com|author=Damon Martin|date=2016-04-10|accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shana Dobson was scheduled to face Wu Yanan at the event. However, Dobson pulled out of the fight in mid-October citing an injury and was replaced by Lauren Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mmajunkie.com/2018/10/lauren-mueller-replaces-shana-dobson-vs-wu-yanan-ufc-fight-night-141|title=Lauren Mueller replaces Shana Dobson vs. Wu Yanan at UFC Fight Night 141|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=2018-10-18|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos]] was expected to face [[Li Jingliang]] at the event. However, Santos pulled out from the bout on October 27 due to a knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/platform/amp/2018/10/27/18031786/knee-injury-forces-elizeu-zaleski-out-ufc-beijing-li-jingliang|title=Knee injury forces Elizeu Zaleski out of UFC Beijing|publisher=mmafighting.com|author=Guilherme Cruz|date=2018-10-27|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by David Zawada.&lt;ref name="ZawadaIn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmadna.nl/david-zawada-pakt-short-notice-partij-tegen-li-jingliang-tijdens-ufc-beijing/|title=David Zawada tackles short notice party against Li Jingliang during UFC Beijing|publisher=mmadna.nl|author=Marcel Dorff|date=2018-11-01|accessdate=2018-11-01}} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frankie Saenz]] was expected to face [[Song Yadong]] at the event. However on November 7, it was reported that he pulled out of the bout due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Vince Morales.&lt;ref name="MMADNA2Chinese"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmadna.nl/chinese-team-alpha-male-vechters-maken-opwachting-tijdens-ufc-beijing/|title=Chinese Team Alpha Male fighters make an appearance at UFC Beijing|publisher=mmadna.nl|author=Marcel Dorff|date=2018-11-07|accessdate=2018-11-07}} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the weigh-ins, Rashad Coulter weighed in at 208 pounds, 2 pounds over the light heavyweight non-title fight limit of 206. Coulter was fined 20 percent of his purse, which went to his opponent Hu Yaozong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/ufc-beijing-weigh-in-results-rashad-coulter-comes-in-heavy/|title=UFC Beijing weigh in results: Rashad Coulter comes in heavy|date=2018-11-23|publisher=bjpenn.com|author=Drake Riggs|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
