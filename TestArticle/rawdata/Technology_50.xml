'''Agritech''' is the use of [[technology]] in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and [[aquaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sproutagritech.com/what-is-agritech/ | title=What is Agritech? | work=Sprout | accessdate=11 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of improving yield, efficiency, and profitability. Agritech can be products, services or applications derived from agriculture that improve various input/output processes.

==History==
A major turning point for agricultural technology is the [[Industrial Revolution]].

==Types of agritech==

Technologies and applications in agri-tech include:

Drones
satellite photography and sensors
IoT-based sensor networks
phase tracking
weather forecasts
automated irrigation
light and heat control
intelligent software analysis for pest and disease prediction, soil management and other involved analytical tasks
Biotech is another type of agri-tech.

==Practical use-case of Technology in Agribusiness==

Agriculture has been wrongly perceived in the past as a "dirty job" for the old people in rural communities but with the renaissance Technology brought to Agriculture, young people now see it as a potential sector to explore.

This is the practical use of Technology in Agriculture by a few start-ups in Africa.

===Mobile Application for Agriculture===

There is a Nigeria’s digital agriculture platform  which focused on connecting farm sponsors with real farmers in order to increase food production while promoting youth participation in agriculture.

This agritech startup is currently disrupting the agriculture ecosystem in the country by connecting small-scale farmers with investors using their platform App which is available on Google and Apple app stores.

Farmers and sponsors all receive a percentage of the profits on harvest. The platform also makes provision for insurance cover for all existing farm projects, so that in the event of unforeseen circumstances, the sponsors’ capital can be refunded.

===Drones for Agriculture ===
Drones can be used on Crop field for scanning with compact multispectral imaging sensors, GPS map creation through onboard cameras, heavy payload transportation, and livestock monitoring with thermal-imaging camera-equipped drones.

High-income countries have seen recent improvements in their agricultural management systems through modern remote sensing technology, such as satellites and aircraft and the information they collect. Out of the vast amount of data collected, advice is provided to farmers and fishers to help inform their decisions.

This has led to better crop yields, higher quality produce and more sustainable agricultural practices in some cases. Big data also informs high-level decision-makers on how to better manage food supply at national and regional levels.

The use of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) better known as 'drones' for agricultural purposes is a new emerging technology which could revolutionise the way agricultural entrepreneurs interact with their land, water, crops and infrastructure. UAVs can be made specifically for business use and farming in particular, they can capture geo-referenced, overlapping, high-resolution images (2–5&amp;nbsp;cm) of 400 hectares in a single flight; can seamlessly upload data and produce agricultural analytics from their data management systems, and fly autonomously from take-off to landing.

{{empty section|date=December 2016}}

===Blockchain for Agriculture===

A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically.

Originally developed as the accounting method for the virtual currency Bitcoin, blockchains – which use what's known as distributed ledger technology (DLT) – are appearing in a variety of commercial applications today. Currently, the technology is primarily used to verify transactions, within digital currencies though it is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain. Doing so creates an indelible record that cannot be changed; furthermore, the record’s authenticity can be verified by the entire community using the blockchain instead of a single centralized authority.

Today, Blockchain is revolutionizing the Agriculture sector in many ways including

Trading commodities on the blockchain is helping to reduce middlemen interference by promoting a peer-to-peer model of connecting farmers with end users. It is also helping to promote fairer trades by removing trade barriers, reducing over reliance on United States Dollars and promoting cross-border trading in local currency.

Other methods of leveraging blockchain technology is in settling land disputes through blockchain based land registry, and using QR codes to promote traceability.

{{empty section|date=December 2016}}

==ICT for Agriculture==
Information Communication Technologies like podcasts, weblogs, social media platforms, e-books are constantly helping to bridge the information gap in the Agriculture sector for farmers and Agripreneurs.

==Hydroponics Technology==
Hydroponics is a soilless farming technology that is used to grow vegetables and tomatoes.

It guarantees an all-year-round production for farmers and insulates these crops from the effects of climate change.

'''Alphagov''' was the project name of the experimental prototype website built by the [[Government Digital Service]] and launched on 11 May 2011 by the UK [[Cabinet Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government launches single government website prototype |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/government-launches-single-government-website-prototype |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Work begins on Alphagov single government website |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8416250/Work-begins-on-Alphagov-single-government-website.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Matt |last=Warman |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was open for public comment for two months in order to judge the feasibility of a single domain for [[British Government]] web services.

==Purpose==
Launched in response to the report by [[Martha Lane Fox]] ''Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in November 2010. Alphagov sought to act as a proof of concept for the way citizens could interact with Government through a series of useful online tools, where they were more useful than published content alone.

As well as improving the 'citizen experience' of using government web services online the project also identified the potential for £64 million in yearly savings on central government's annual £128 million current web publishing bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New government web domain to save £64m, but at what cost? |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Kevin |last=Rawlinson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716234722/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
This initial consultation period was completed in June 2011. A [[Beta_version#Beta|beta version]] was then created, which led to the launch of [[GOV.UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alpha.gov.uk to become beta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/jun/27/alpha-gov-uk-central-government-website-becomes-beta-version |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10539">'''Ann Rockley''' is one of Canada's foremost experts in organizing and presenting information online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/21-Rockley Ann Rockley, content management expert] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216074223/http://www.cmswatch.com/Analyst/21-Rockley |date=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the founder and President of The Rockley Group, based in the greater Toronto Area. She regularly presents papers and workshops on subjects involving the efficient creation, management and delivery of content for organizations in North America and Europe. 
She was the lead analyst for ''The XML &amp; Component Content Management Report''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmswatch.com/CCM/Report/ ''The XML &amp; Component Content Management Report 2008''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204093144/http://www.cmswatch.com/CCM/Report/ |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Content Management Systems Watch.

==Education and early career ==
At university, Ann Rockley took a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronomy. In the early 1980s, she got her first permanent job as a junior technical writer at [[I. P. Sharp Associates]]. She went on to work for Cemcorp, Unisys, and American Express, then formed Information Design Solutions with two partners, Heather Fawcett and Sam Ferdinand. According to Gerlinde Schuller, [[information design]] is a complex, interdisciplinary, and experimental art. The partnership consulted in usability, document analysis, [[SGML]],&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, Heather J. ''Using Tagged Text to Support Online Views.'' Technical Report OED-89-04. Waterloo, Ontario: University of Waterloo Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary, July 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and large-scale online documentation projects.&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann. "Ontario Hydro and SGML." ''Technical Communication: Journal of the Society for Technical Communication 40/3'' (Third Quarter, August 1993) 383-386. {{ISSN|0049-3155}}. Author affiliation: Information Design Solutions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Rockley left Information Design Solutions to start The Rockley Group. She took a master's degree in [[information science]] at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at The Rockley Group full-time.

==Involvement with the STC==
In the mid-1980s, Rockley took the initiative to revive the Toronto chapter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stctoronto.org Toronto STC]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Society for Technical Communication]], a professional organization for [[Technical communication|technical communicators]], by getting in touch with the international organization's representative for her area, Rennie Charles. The chapter was founded in 1959 but had been dormant for several years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stctoronto.org/membership/mem-chapter-history.htm History of Toronto STC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175401/http://www.stctoronto.org/membership/mem-chapter-history.htm |date=2008-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Michelle Hutchinson, another technical communicator, assembled a group of their colleagues and presented a plan to hold regular meetings, find speakers of interest, and develop services for technical communicators. The chapter has been active ever since. Among other things, Rockley served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and was general manager for a very successful three-day, multi-stream conference in 1989. (Hutchinson served as chapter president, produced the newsletter, and organized the hosting of the international society's annual conference in 1997.)

When Toronto hosted the international conference, Rockley proposed producing the conference proceedings on CD as well as in book form. She also volunteered to produce the CDs for the 2500 attendees. That was the first time it had been done. The machine-readable format proved to be so popular that it has been provided in one form or another ever since.

Rockley regularly presents papers and workshops at the annual meeting of the [http://www.stc.org international Society for Technical Communication]. She was named an Associate Fellow of the STC for her contributions to the profession, and in 2005 became a Fellow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stc.org/PDF_Files/fellows2007.pdf STC list of fellows (PDF file)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Society's highest honor.

==Teaching and writing==
Ann Rockley helped to develop the Information Design certificate program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She has taught courses in the program (information design and [[enterprise content management]]).

Rockley is the lead author of a 2002 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Kostur, Pamela; Manning, Steve. ''Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy.'' October, 2002. 582 pages. New Riders Press, Berkeley, CA. {{ISBN|0-7357-1306-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy'', co-authored with Pamela Kostur and Steve Manning, who both worked with Ann at The Rockley Group. It has become a standard reference manual for content management. Her methodology includes [[return on investment]] calculations, which can justify the content management effort to executives.

She is also the lead author of a 2009 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Cooper, Charles; Manning, Steve. "DITA 101: Fundamentals of DITA for Authors and Managers." May, 2009. 148 pages. The Rockley Press, Schomberg, ON, Canada. {{ISBN|0-557-07291-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;''DITA 101: Fundamentals of DITA for Authors and Managers'', co-authored with Charles Cooper and Steve Manning. It is a beginner's guide to understanding the [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] (DITA), an XML-based architecture for authoring, producing, and delivering information.

Rockley's 2015 book,&lt;ref&gt;Rockley, Ann; Cooper, Charles; Abel, Scott. "Intelligent Content: A Primer" September, 2015. 144 pages. XML Press, Laguna Hills, CA {{ISBN|978-1937434465}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Intelligent Content: A Primer'', was co-authored with Charles Cooper and [[Scott Abel]]. It is a beginner's guide to creating intelligent content—defined as content which is not limited to one purpose, technology or output—and overcoming the challenges to its adoption. Intelligent Content was published by XML Press.

==Innovation==
Facing challenges such as putting online 10,000+ pages of documentation for a nuclear power plant, Rockley has been an innovator in devising ways to handle large quantities of online information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/sigdoc/sigdoc1993.html#Rockley93 Rockley, Ann.

The Importance of XML to a Unified Content Strategy. ''InformIT'', December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with CM Pros==
As her interests became more specialized, Rockley went on to help found another professional organization, the Content Management Professionals (CM Pros), in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/I-Column-Like-I-CM/The-CM-Professionals-Community-of-Practice-7170.htm Content Management community of practice]&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the president in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockley.com/ The Rockley Group, Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with OASIS==
Ann Rockley is a member of the [[Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards]] (OASIS). It is a "not-for-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php OASIS]&lt;/ref&gt; She is the Co-Chair of the [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture|DITA]] for Enterprise Business Documents Subcommittee&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/25981/DITA%20for%20Enterprise%20Business%20Documents%20Sub-committee%20Background.pdf Goals of the Enterprise Business Documents Subcommittee of OASIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 2014-2016: Private Beta ===
On June 4th, 2014, Brigade Beta became available to download on [[iOS]] or [[Google Play]], in its private [[beta]] version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this beginning stage, the app asked users to agree or disagree on a position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brigade then split up its users into those who agreed on the issue and those who disagreed on the issue. Participants were also allowed to write their own opinions on positions and ask those in their respective group if they were "for" or "against" the opinion stated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Sean Parker’s new political app Brigade has launched in private beta|author= Wright, Mic|access-date=2018-04-10|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/17/sean-parkers-new-political-app-brigade-has-launched-in-private-beta/?via=indexdotco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016-present: Open Beta  ===
==== Voter guide ====
A few weeks before the November 2016 elections, Brigade created a ballot [[guide]] for its users.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It ran these voter guides in [[San Francisco]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citeweb|language=en-US|title=Brigade, The Political Engagement Platform Backed By Sean Parker, Launches A Voter Guide For Nov.

One could agree, disagree, or click unsure as their answer choices.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade tries to provide a simple solution to elections, but is it too simple?|author= Hockenson, Lauren|website=thenextweb.com|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/14/brigade-tries-to-provide-a-simple-solution-to-elections-but-is-it-too-simple/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the questionnaire, the guide gave recommendations on who to vote for and which [[propositions]] to pass or not pass.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, the app also determined these choices based on those a user socializes with on Brigade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade launches first of its kind social ballot guide for U.S. voters|website=brigade.news|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigade users could then pledge their votes to the candidates and propositions listed on the ballot. With these pledges, the app could track which candidates had more pledged votes in real time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Users were further able to recruit pledges from other users for their favorite candidates or propositions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Voter verification==== 
Brigade implemented a voter [[Third-party verification|verification]] service as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=
With voter verification, Brigade becomes a more legitimate platform for political debate|author=Cutler, Kim-Mai|website=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/brigade-voter-verification/?via=indexdotco|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With voter verification, a user can determine how similar or different a political representative's viewpoints are from their own.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; This data was received from [[Google API|Google's Civic API]] with geographic information on 520,000 American elected officials.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

==== Acquisitions ====

Brigade Media has acquired [[Causes_(company)|Causes]],[[Votizen]], and Voter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tech.co/brigade-acquires-votizen-and-causes-2014-06|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes and Votizens, Adds Tons of Executives|website=Tech.co|language=en-US|author=Schmidt, Will|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Brigade acquires politics matchmaking service Voter, plans to shutter service later this year|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/brigade-acquires-politics-matchmaking-service-voter-plans-to-shutter-service-later-this-year/?via=indexdotco|website=venturebeat.com|language=en-US|author=Yeung, Ken|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|author=Wilhelm, Alex|title=Brigade Media Acquires Causes In Its Quest To Revitalize American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/sean-parkers-brigade-media-acquires-causes-in-its-quest-to-revitalize-american-democracy/|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Causes was the largest [[online]] platform where candidates could [[Political campaign|campaign]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Votizen functioned as a [[tool]] for voters to learn more about their leaders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the time of its acquisition, Voter aimed to put voters and politicians together via shared viewpoints.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These three companies helped Brigade gain [[social media]] presence and find intelligent [[workers]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade Welcomes Voter Founder &amp; CEO

===Background===
As technology has advanced, it was assumed that the average individual would have further access to voting, and therefore, voting numbers would increase. Instead, voter turnout at the elections remains low, with numbers at the presidential elections between 50% and 60% of the US population in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Presidential Elections: 1828 - 2012|author= Peters, Gerhard and Woolley, John T.|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php|website=presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the midterm election of 2014, only 36.4% of people voted, the lowest percentage since 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voter Turnout in Midterm Elections Hits 72-Year Low|author= Alter, Charlotte|url=http://time.com/3576090/midterm-elections-turnout-world-war-two/|website=Time|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that civic technology will incentivize and educate its users to vote. Brigade's voter ballot was an attempt as a [[Civic technology|civic technology platform]] to increase voter participation as well as educate its users about candidates and propositions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The tools we build in Silicon Valley represent the best hope for fixing our democracy|author=Mahan Matt|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/2/1/14476462/civic-tech-organize-march-change-citizen-engagement-democracy-brigade|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
One mission of Brigade Media is to act as a [[foreground]] for its users to connect and organize so that they can voice their opinions on our nation's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media|url=https://parker.org/initiatives/brigade-media|website=parker.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more general goal is to increase voter participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Parker forms Brigade Media to charge politics|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/11/sean-parker-brigade-politics/10326463/|website=usatoday.com|author=Guynn, Jessica|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Brigade interacts with American [[voters]] by linking its users to the same held concerns.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|language=en-US|title=Brigade-Make Change Into Action|url=https://brigade.com|website=brigade.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of [[elected officials]] on those concerns will be provided and metrics about the [[candidate]] most similar in concerns and degree of concern will be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Seeks To Reboot Political Engagement In America With Civic Social Media|author= Howard, Alexander|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexander-howard/brigade-seeks-to-reboot-political-engagement_b_7607306.html|website=huffingtonpost|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data should be useful for both candidates and voters, in that voters can voice their grievances and candidates must respond accordingly.

==Funding==
In 2014, Brigade Media received about $9.5 million in [[seed money]] from [[Sean Parker]], [[Marc Benioff]], and [[Ron Conway]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Brigade Beta, Sean Parker's civic-focused social network|url=https://mashable.com/2015/06/17/sean-parker-brigade-beta-civics-social/?via=indexdotco#lp4nVNPhzuqj|author=Mangalindan, JP|website=mashable.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Media Raises $9.3M From Sean Parker To Shake Up American Democracy|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/brigade-media-raises-9-3m-from-sean-parker-to-shake-up-american-democracy/|author=Wilhelm, Alex|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==

===Criticism===
[[Barbara Simons]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[IBM]], asserts that all current forms of digital voting devices are hackable, and that the best unhackable option is paper.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Computer Scientist Who Prefers Paper|access-date=2014-04-17|website=theatlantic.com|language=en-US|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/guardian-of-the-vote/544155/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, a Canadian study revealed that online voting platforms may not improve voter participation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The study found that those who did not already vote on paper ballots did not vote with digital devices.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Instead, non-paper voting forms are simply more convenient for those who would have already decided to vote.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Now the Time for Internet Voting?:BC’s Independent Panel on Internet Voting|access-date=2014-04-17|website=revparl.ca|language=en-US|author=Archer, Keith|url=http://www.revparl.ca/37/4/37n4e_14_Archer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this [[data]] brought to light, the Independent Panel On Internet Voting did not recommend internet voting to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Election Task Force Report: 2017 Jun 28|access-date=2014-04-17|website=council.vancouver.ca|language=en-US|url=http://council.vancouver.ca/20170628/documents/pspc1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Brigade's [[Executive Chairman]], [[Sean Parker]], was the [[President (corporate title)|president]] of [[Facebook]] in mid-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students' Start-up Draws Attention and $13 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/students-startup-draws-attention-and-13-million.html|author=Rosen, Ellen|website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Facebook]] sold information on over 50 million Facebook users to [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|author=Rosenberg, Matthew, Confessore, Nicholas, and Cadwalldr, Carole |website=NYTimes|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Parker's previous relationship with Facebook could provide controversy in his work with Brigade Media and his other projects.

At the company's formation, Brigade Media also faced a [[racial]] controversy. When Brigade was only a few weeks old, the entire [[Leadership|leadership division]] of the [[start-up]] was white males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The company addressed the issues by filling in 12 additional positions and noting that women were also present in the [[organization]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Results==

When the ballot guide was introduced, about 67% of its users were [[millennials]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This is an accomplishment because millennial participation in the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]] had declined.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Results Are In on Sean Parker's Brigade App: Millennial Voters Used It|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/11/5/11620390/election-results-are-in-on-sean-parkers-brigade-app-millennial-voters|author=Chmielewski, Dawn|website=recode.net|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the ballot guide, the [[start-up]] had 100,000 pledged candidates and 400,000 friends of candidates also pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brigade Launches First of Its Kind Social Ballot Guide for U.S. Voters|url=https://brigade.news/brigade-launches-first-of-its-kind-social-ballot-guide-for-u-s-voters-21a69c7f6a75|website=brigade.news|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The platforms data also saw [[Donald Trump]] winning swing states before the polls in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States Presidential Election]].&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite web|title=An App Called Brigade Saw Trump Winning Swing States When Polls Didn't|access-date=2014-04-17|website=npr.org|language=en-US|author=Shahani, Aarti|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/10/501613521/an-app-saw-trump-winning-swing-states-when-polls-didnt}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Brigade had 200,000 [[verified]] users. Within the vote pledges, 94.5% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] pledged to vote for Republican nominee Trump, with 2.2% pledging with Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; However, on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] pledge side, only 55% pledged for Clinton while 40% of Democrats pledged for Trump.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

|caption = Computers and computing devices from different eras}}

A '''computer''' is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of [[arithmetic]] or [[Boolean algebra|logical]] operations automatically via [[computer programming]]. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called ''[[Computer program|programs]].'' These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

Computers are used as [[control system]]s for a wide variety of [[Programmable logic controller|industrial]] and [[Consumer electronics|consumer devices]]. This includes simple special purpose devices like [[microwave oven]]s and [[remote control]]s, factory devices such as [[industrial robot]]s and [[computer-aided design]], and also general purpose devices like [[personal computer]]s and [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s.

Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the [[abacus]] aided people in doing calculations. Early in the [[Industrial Revolution]], some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for [[loom]]s. More sophisticated electrical [[machine]]s did specialized [[analogue electronics|analog]] calculations in the early 20th century. The first [[Digital data|digital]] electronic calculating machines were developed during [[World War II]].  The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then.

Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one [[processing element]], typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), and some form of [[memory (computers)|memory]]. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored [[data|information]]. [[Peripheral]] devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era [[touchscreen]]). Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

== Etymology ==
[[File:X-4 with Female Computer - GPN-2000-001932.jpg|thumb|A female computer, with microscope and calculator, 1952]]
According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the first known use of the word "computer" was in 1613 in a book called ''The Yong Mans Gleanings'' by English writer Richard Braithwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage of the term referred to a [[human computer]], a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. Originally, women were often hired as "human computers" because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, most human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.&lt;ref name=OEDComputer&gt;{{Cite journal |title=computer, ''n.'' |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' gives the first attested use of "computer" in the "1640s, [meaning] "one who calculates,"; this is an "...&amp;nbsp;agent noun from compute (v.)". The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' states that the use of the term to mean "calculating machine" (of any type) is from 1897."  The ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' indicates that the "modern use" of the term, to mean "programmable digital electronic computer" dates from "...&amp;nbsp;1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as [[Turing machine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=computer|title=computer (n.)|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of computing hardware}}

=== Pre-20th century ===
[[File:Os d'Ishango IRSNB.JPG|thumb|upright=0.45|The [[Ishango bone]]]]
Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using [[one-to-one correspondence]] with [[finger counting|fingers]]. The earliest counting device was probably a form of [[tally stick]]. Later record keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|1981}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=30 January 2012 }} ) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|publisher=|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p.&amp;nbsp;5: calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[counting rods]] is one example.
[[File:Abacus 6.png|thumb|left|The Chinese [[Suanpan]] (算盘) (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408)]]
The [[abacus]] was initially used for arithmetic tasks. The [[Roman abacus]] was developed from devices used in [[Babylonia]] as early as 2400 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.

[[File:NAMA Machine d'Anticythère 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]-designed [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating between 150 and 100 BC, is the world's oldest analog computer.]]
The [[Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog "computer", according to [[Derek J. de Solla Price]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/project/general/the-project.html ''The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project''], The Antikythera Mechanism Research Project. Retrieved 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the [[Antikythera wreck]] off the Greek island of [[Antikythera]], between [[Kythera]] and [[Crete]], and has been dated to {{circa|100 BC}}. Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.

Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use. The [[planisphere]] was a [[star chart]] invented by Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī in the early 11th century.&lt;ref name=Wiet&gt;G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff, P. Wolff, J. Naudu (1975). ''History of Mankind, Vol 3: The Great medieval Civilisations'', p. 649. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrolabe]] was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]] in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. A combination of the planisphere and [[dioptra]], the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in [[spherical astronomy]].

The [[Sector (instrument)|sector]], a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

The [[planimeter]] was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.

[[File:Sliderule 2005.png|thumb|A slide rule]]
The [[slide rule]] was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after the publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]]. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as [[transcendental function]]s such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic]] [[trigonometry]] and other [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the [[E6B]] circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft.

In the 1770s, [[Pierre Jaquet-Droz]], a Swiss [[watchmaker]], built a mechanical doll ([[automata|automaton]]) that could write holding a quill pen. By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced. In effect, it could be mechanically "programmed" to read instructions. Along with two other complex machines, the doll is at the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire of [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]], and still operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chonday.com/Videos/the-writer-automaton|title=The Writer Automaton, Switzerland|date=11 July 2013|publisher=chonday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tide-predicting machine]] invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.

The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve [[differential equations]] by [[integral|integration]], used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876, [[James Thomson (engineer)|Lord Kelvin]] had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the [[ball-and-disk integrator]]s.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com"&gt;Ray Girvan, [http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html "The revealed grace of the mechanism: computing after Babbage"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094710/http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html |date=3 November 2012 }}, ''Scientific Computing World'', May/June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The [[torque amplifier]] was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, [[Vannevar Bush]] and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.

=== First computing device ===
[[File:Difference engine plate 1853.jpg|thumb|A portion of [[Charles Babbage|Babbage's]] [[Difference engine]].]]
[[Charles Babbage]], an English mechanical engineer and [[polymath]], originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "[[computer pioneer|father of the computer]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher=Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 0-02-741370-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he conceptualized and invented the first [[mechanical computer]] in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary [[difference engine]], designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an [[Analytical Engine]], was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[program loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as [[Turing-complete]].&lt;ref name="babbageonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5|title=Babbage|work=Online stuff|publisher=Science Museum|date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html|title=Let's build Babbage's ultimate mechanical computer|work=opinion|publisher=New Scientist|date = 23 December 2010|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand&amp;nbsp;– this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the [[British Government]] to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the ''mill'') in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.

=== Analog computers ===
[[File:099-tpm3-sk.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]]'s third tide-predicting machine design, 1879–81]]
During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific [[computing]] needs were met by increasingly sophisticated [[analog computer]]s, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for [[computation]]. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.&lt;ref name="stanf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=The Modern History of Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern analog computer was a [[tide-predicting machine]], invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872. The [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.&lt;ref name="scientific-computing.com" /&gt;

The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the [[differential analyzer]], built by H. L. Hazen and [[Vannevar Bush]] at [[MIT]] starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education ([[control systems]]) and aircraft ([[slide rule]]).

==== Electromechanical ====
By 1938, the [[United States Navy]] had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a [[submarine]]. This was the [[Torpedo Data Computer]], which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target. During [[World War II]] similar devices were developed in other countries as well.

[[File:Z3 Deutsches Museum.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Replica of [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical) computer.]]
Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using [[vacuum tube]]s. The [[Z2 (computer)|Z2]], created by German engineer [[Konrad Zuse]] in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer.&lt;ref name="Part 4 Zuse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm|title=Part 4:  Konrad Zuse's Z1 and Z3 Computers|last=Zuse|first=Horst|work=The Life and Work of Konrad Zuse|publisher=EPE Online|accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601210541/http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part4a.htm |archivedate = 1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], the world's first working [[electromechanical]] [[Computer programming|programmable]], fully automatic digital computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zuse|first=Konrad|author-link=Konrad Zuse|title=The Computer – My Life ''Translated by McKenna, Patricia and Ross, J.

It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as [[floating point number]]s. Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in [[Charles Babbage]]'s earlier design), using a [[binary numeral system|binary]] system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goremotesupport.com/blog/crash-the-story-of-it-zuse|title=Crash!

==== Vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits ====
{{Anchor|Digital computer|Digital}}
Purely [[electronic circuit]] elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog. The engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], working at the [[Post Office Research Station]] in [[London]] in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the [[telephone exchange]]. Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the [[telephone exchange]] network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of [[vacuum tube]]s.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; In the US, [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] and [[Clifford Berry|Clifford E. Berry]] of Iowa State University developed and tested the [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (ABC) in 1942,&lt;ref&gt;15 January 1941 notice in the ''Des Moines Register'',&lt;/ref&gt; the first "automatic electronic digital computer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Electronic Computer|author=Arthur W. Burks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory.&lt;ref name=Copeland2006&gt;{{Citation|last=Copeland|first=Jack|year=2006|title=Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=101–115|isbn=0-19-284055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumb|[[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the first [[Electronics|electronic]] [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[Computer programming|programmable]] computing device, was used to break German ciphers during World War II.]]
During World War II, the British at [[Bletchley Park]] achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]], was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical [[bombe]]s which were often run by women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29840653|title=The woman who cracked Enigma cyphers|last=Miller|first=Joe|date=November 10, 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park|title=Meet the female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|last=Bearne|first=Suzanne|date=July 24, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To crack the more sophisticated German [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] machine, used for high-level Army communications, [[Max Newman]] and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]].&lt;ref name=Copeland2006 /&gt; He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bletchley's code-cracking Colossus|publisher=BBC News |date=2 February 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8492762.stm|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January 1944&lt;ref name="The Colossus Computer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnmoc.org/colossus-rebuild-story|title=Colossus – The Rebuild Story|website=The National Museum of Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked its first message on 5 February.&lt;ref name="Copeland2006" /&gt;

Colossus was the world's first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[Computer programming|programmable]] computer.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt; It used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of [[boolean logic]]al operations on its data, but it was not [[Turing-complete]]. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I contained 1,500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2,400 valves, was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark I, greatly speeding the decoding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Randell|first1=Brian|author-link1=Brian Randell|last2=Fensom|first2=Harry|last3=Milne|first3=Frank A.|title=Obituary: Allen Coombs|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 March 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-coombs-1611270.html|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fensom|first=Jim|title=Harry Fensom obituary|date=8 November 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/08/harry-fensom-obituary|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eniac.jpg|thumb|left|[[ENIAC]] was the first electronic, Turing-complete device, and performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the [[United States Army]].]]
The U.S.-built [[ENIAC]]&lt;ref&gt;John Presper Eckert Jr. and John W. Mauchly, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,120,606, filed 26 June 1947, issued 4 February 1964, and invalidated 19 October 1973 after court ruling on ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was [[Turing-complete]]. Like the Colossus, a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches. The programmers of the ENIAC were six women, often known collectively as the "ENIAC girls".{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=39}}{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=459}}

It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of [[John Mauchly]] and [[J. Presper Eckert]] at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.&lt;ref name="Eniac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techiwarehouse.com/engine/a046ee08/Generations-of-Computer|title=Generations of Computer|publisher=techiwarehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern computers ===

==== Concept of modern computer ====
The principle of the modern computer was proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his seminal 1936 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s2-42/1/230|doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230|title=On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem|first=A. M.|last=Turing|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|year=1937|series=2|volume=42|number=1|pages=230–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Computable Numbers''. Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the [[stored program]], where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.&lt;ref&gt;"von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others." Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.&lt;/ref&gt; Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]]. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be [[Turing-complete]], which is to say, they have [[algorithm]] execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.

==== Stored programs ====
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum close up.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards|A section of the [[Manchester Baby]], the first electronic stored-program computer]]
Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.&lt;ref name="Copeland2006" /&gt; With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by design an [[instruction set]] and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]]. The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1936 paper. In 1945, Turing joined the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer. His 1945 report "Proposed Electronic Calculator" was the first specification for such a device. John von Neumann at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] also circulated his ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="stanf" /&gt;

The [[Manchester Baby]] was the world's first [[stored-program computer]]. It was built at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] by [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C. Williams]], [[Tom Kilburn]] and [[Geoff Tootill]], and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a [[testbed]] for the [[Williams tube]], the first [[Random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Early computers at Manchester University|journal=Resurrection|volume=1|issue=4|publisher=The Computer Conservation Society|date=Summer 1992|url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|issn=0958-7403|accessdate=7 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828010743/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g|archive-date=28 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the computer was considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|title=Early Electronic Computers (1946–51)|publisher=University of Manchester|accessdate=16 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105031620/http://www.computer50.org/mark1/contemporary.html|archivedate=5 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the [[Manchester Mark 1]].

==== Transistors ====
&lt;!-- [[Second generation of computers]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bipolar junction transistor]]]]
The bipolar [[transistor]] was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors replaced [[vacuum tube]]s in computer designs, giving rise to the "second generation" of computers.
Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.

At the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lavington|first=Simon|title=A History of Manchester Computers|year=1998|edition=2|publisher=The British Computer Society|location=Swindon|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]] and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]], and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125&amp;nbsp;kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic [[drum memory]], so it was not the first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the [[Harwell CADET]] of 1955,&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee"&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

==== Integrated circuits ====
The next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the [[integrated circuit]].
The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Geoffrey Dummer|Geoffrey W.A. Dummer]]. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.]] on 7 May 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html "The Hapless Tale of Geoffrey Dummer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181443/http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html |date=11 May 2013 }}, (n.d.), (HTML), ''Electronic Product News'', accessed 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical ICs were invented by [[Jack Kilby]] at [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Robert Noyce]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Jack|last=Kilby|author-link=Jack Kilby|title=Nobel lecture|publisher=Nobel Foundation|year=2000|location=Stockholm|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/kilby-lecture.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.&lt;ref name="TIJackBuilt"&gt;[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml ''The Chip that Jack Built''], (c. 2008), (HTML), Texas Instruments, Retrieved 29 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as "a body of semiconductor material&amp;nbsp;... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated".&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Kilby, Miniaturized Electronic Circuits, United States Patent Office, US Patent 3,138,743, filed 6 February 1959, issued 23 June 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Winston| first = Brian| title = Media Technology and Society: A History : From the Telegraph to the Internet| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gfeCXlElJTwC&amp;pg=PA221| year = 1998| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-14230-4| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Noyce]]'s Unitary circuit, {{Ref patent |country=US |number=2981877|status=patent|gdate=1961-04-25|title=Semiconductor device-and-lead structure |assign1 =[[Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of [[silicon]], whereas Kilby's chip was made of [[germanium]].

This new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the [[microprocessor]]. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the [[Intel 4004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Intel's First Microprocessor—the Intel 4004 |publisher=Intel Corp. |date=November 1971 |url=http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |accessdate=17 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513221700/http://www.intel.com/museum/archives/4004.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed and realized by [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], and Stanley Mazor at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 2300 transistors; by comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, composed of 5.5&amp;nbsp;million transistors, according to {{citation|last1= Patterson |first1= David |last2= Hennessy|first2= John|year=1998|title= Computer Organization and Design |location= San Francisco|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]]|isbn = 1-55860-428-6|pages=27–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile computers ===

The first [[portable computer|mobile computers]] were heavy and ran from mains power. The 50lb [[IBM 5100]] was an early example. Later portables such as the [[Osborne 1]] and [[Compaq Portable]] were considerably lighter, but still needed to be plugged in. The first [[laptop]]s, such as the [[Grid Compass]], removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/12/global-notebook-shipments-finally-overtake-desktops/|title=Global notebook shipments finally overtake desktops|work=Ars Technica|first=David|last=Chartier|date=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones.

These [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]] run on a variety of operating systems and soon became the dominant computing device on the market, with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated 237 million devices in 2Q 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IDC|title=Growth Accelerates in the Worldwide Mobile Phone and Smartphone Markets in the Second Quarter, According to IDC|date=25 July 2013|url=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022208/http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24239313|archive-date=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general purpose computer has four main components: the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), the [[control unit]], the [[Computer data storage|memory]], and the [[input and output devices]] (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by [[bus (computing)|buses]], often made of groups of [[wire]]s.
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small [[electrical network|electrical circuits]] which can be turned off or on by means of an [[transistor|electronic switch]]. Each circuit represents a [[bit]] (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a "1", and when off it represents a "0" (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in [[logic gate]]s so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

=== Input devices ===
When unprocessed data is sent to the computer with the help of input devices, the data is processed and sent to output devices. The input devices may be hand-operated or automated. The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU. Some examples of input devices are:
* [[Computer keyboard]]
* [[Digital camera]]
* [[Digital video]]
* [[Graphics tablet]]
* [[Image scanner]]
* [[Joystick]]
* [[Microphone]]
* [[Mouse (computing)|Mouse]]
* [[Overlay keyboard]]
* [[Real-time clock]]
* [[Trackball]]
* [[Touchscreen]]

=== Output devices ===
The means through which computer gives output are known as output devices. Some examples of output devices are:
* [[Computer monitor]]
* [[Printer (computing)|Printer]]
* [[PC speaker]]
* [[Projector]]
* [[Sound card]]
* [[Video card]]

=== Control unit ===
{{Main|CPU design|Control unit}}
[[File:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing how a particular [[MIPS architecture]] instruction would be decoded by the control system]]

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Some computers have instructions that are partially interpreted by the control unit with further interpretation performed by another device. For example, [[EDVAC]], one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.

A key component common to all CPUs is the [[program counter]], a special memory cell (a [[processor register|register]]) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:

# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).

Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as "jumps" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of [[control flow]]).

The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a [[microsequencer]], which runs a [[microcode]] program that causes all of these events to happen.

=== Central processing unit (CPU) ===
The control unit, ALU, and registers are collectively known as a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single [[integrated circuit]] called a ''[[microprocessor]]''.

=== Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) ===
{{Main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | title = The Most Complex Machine: A Survey of Computers and Computing

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, [[trigonometry]] functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and [[square root]]s. Some can only operate on whole numbers ([[integer]]s) while others use [[floating point]] to represent [[real number]]s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return [[Truth value|boolean truth values]] (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other ("is 64 greater than 65?"). Logic operations involve [[Boolean logic]]: [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[logical disjunction|OR]], [[Exclusive or|XOR]], and [[Negation|NOT]]. These can be useful for creating complicated [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]] and processing [[boolean logic]].

[[Superscalar]] computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Handbook of Parallel Computing and Statistics | author = Erricos John Kontoghiorghes | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4067-2 | page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graphics processing unit|Graphics processors]] and computers with [[SIMD]] and [[MIMD]] features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

=== Memory ===
{{Main|Computer data storage}}
[[File:Magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetic core memory]] was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory.]]

A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered "address" and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to "put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357" or to "add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595." The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.

In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store [[binary numeral system|binary numbers]] in groups of eight bits (called a [[byte]]). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in [[two's complement]] notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.

The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called [[Processor register|registers]] that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.

Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:
* [[random-access memory]] or RAM
* [[read-only memory]] or ROM
RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the [[BIOS]] that orchestrates loading the computer's [[operating system]] from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In [[embedded system|embedded computers]], which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called [[firmware]], because it is notionally more like hardware than software. [[Flash memory]] blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. {{harv|Verma &amp; Mielke|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM [[CPU cache|cache memories]], which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

=== Input/output (I/O) ===
{{Main|Input/output}}
[[File:HDDspin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard disk drive]]s are common storage devices used with computers.]]
I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to the Basic Computer | author = Donald Eadie | year = 1968 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called [[peripheral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Introduction to Microcomputers and the Microprocessors | author = Arpad Barna |author2=Dan I. Porat | publisher = Wiley | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-471-05051-3 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], and output devices such as the [[computer monitor|display]] and [[printer (computing)|printer]]. [[Hard disk drive]]s, [[floppy disk]] drives and [[optical disc drive]]s serve as both input and output devices. [[Computer networking]] is another form of I/O.
I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A [[graphics processing unit]] might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Modern [[desktop computer]]s contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O. A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.

=== Multitasking ===
{{Main|Computer multitasking}}
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Learning the UNIX Operating System: A Concise Guide for the New User | author = Jerry Peek |author2=Grace Todino |author3=John Strang  | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-596-00261-9 | page = 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an [[interrupt]], which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running "at the same time". then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed "time-sharing" since each program is allocated a "slice" of time in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Noise Reduction in Speech Applications | author = Gillian M. Davis | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8493-0949-6 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the era of inexpensive computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a "time slice" until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

=== Multiprocessing ===
{{Main|Multiprocessing}}
[[File:Cray 2 Arts et Metiers dsc03940.jpg|thumb|[[Cray]] designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.]]
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as [[supercomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. Multiprocessor and [[multi-core]] (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.

Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called [[computer cluster]]s can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. {{harv|TOP500|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics rendering]], and [[cryptography]] applications, as well as with other so-called "[[embarrassingly parallel]]" tasks.

== Software ==
{{Main|Computer software}}
''Software'' refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical [[Computer hardware|hardware]] from which the system is built. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. It is often divided into [[system software]] and application software]] Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with [[BIOS]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]] in an [[IBM PC compatible]] computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".

=== Application Software ===

=== Programs ===
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be [[computer programming|programmed]]. That is to say that some type of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (the [[Computer program|program]]) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]] often have machine code in the form of an [[imperative programming language]]. In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second ([[FLOPS|gigaflops]]) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of [[programmer]]s years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

==== Stored program architecture ====
{{Main|Computer program|Computer programming}}
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Manchester Baby]], the world's first electronic [[stored-program computer]], at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Manchester, England]]
This section applies to most common [[RAM machine]]–based computers.

In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's [[Computer data storage|memory]] and are generally carried out ([[execution (computing)|executed]]) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called "jump" instructions (or [[Branch (computer science)|branches]]). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen [[conditional (programming)|conditionally]] so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support [[subroutine]]s by providing a type of jump that "remembers" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.

Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the [[control flow|flow of control]] within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Comparatively, a person using a pocket [[calculator]] can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. The following example is written in the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS assembly language]]:
{{Clear}}
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
  begin:
  addi $8, $0, 0           # initialize sum to 0
  addi $9, $0, 1           # set first number to add = 1
  loop:
  slti $10, $9, 1000       # check if the number is less than 1000
  beq $10, $0, finish      # if odd number is greater than n then exit
  add $8, $8, $9           # update sum
  addi $9, $9, 1           # get next number
  j loop                   # repeat the summing process
  finish:
  add $2, $8, $0           # put sum in output register
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.

==== Machine code ====
In most computers, individual instructions are stored as [[machine code]] with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or [[opcode]] for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the [[Harvard architecture]] after the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in [[CPU cache]]s.

While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers ([[machine code|machine language]]) and while this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-8]] could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the [[booting]] process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some [[non-volatile memory]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&amp;nbsp;– a [[mnemonic]] such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's [[assembly language]]. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|right|A 1970s [[punched card]] containing one line from a [[Fortran]] program. The card reads: "Z(1) = Y + W(1)" and is labeled "PROJ039" for identification purposes.]]

==== Programming language ====
{{Main|Programming language}}
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike [[natural language]]s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into [[machine code]] by a [[compiler]] or an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]] before being run, or translated directly at run time by an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

===== Low-level languages =====
{{Main|Low-level programming language}}
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed ''low-level programming languages'') tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an [[ARM architecture]] computer (such as may be found in a [[smartphone]] or a [[handheld video game|hand-held videogame]]) cannot understand the machine language of an [[x86]] CPU that might be in a [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An [[x86-64]] compatible microprocessor like the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] is able to run most of the same programs that an [[Intel Core 2]] microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel [[Pentium]]s and [[Intel 80486]]. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High-level languages/third generation language =====
{{Main|High-level programming language}}
Although considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract [[high-level programming language]]s that are able to express the needs of the [[programmer]] more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually "compiled" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a [[compiler]].&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often [[interpreted language|interpreted]] rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].&lt;/ref&gt; High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various [[video game console]]s.

==== Fourth-generation languages ====
{{Main|Fourth-generation programming language}}
Fourth-generation languages (4GL) are less procedural than 3G languages. The benefit of 4GL is that they provide ways to obtain information without requiring the direct help of a programmer.

==== Program design ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large [[Computer software|software]] systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of [[software engineering]] concentrates specifically on this challenge.

==== Bugs ====
{{Main|Software bug}}
[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer]]
Errors in computer programs are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]". They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to "[[Hang (computing)|hang]]", becoming unresponsive to input such as [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.&lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused some [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain [[floating point]] division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;
Admiral [[Grace Hopper]], an American computer scientist and developer of the first [[compiler]], is credited for having first used the term "bugs" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the [[Harvard Mark II]] computer in September 1947.&lt;ref name="taylor84"&gt;{{cite news

== Firmware ==
Firmware is the technology which has the combination of both hardware and software such as BIOS chip inside a computer. This chip (hardware) is located on the motherboard and has the BIOS set up (software) stored in it.

== Networking and the Internet ==
{{Main|Computer networking|Internet}}
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|left|Visualization of a portion of the [[Routing|routes]] on the Internet]]
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Systems, Experts, and Computers | author = Agatha C. Hughes | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-262-08285-3 | page = 161 | quote = The experience of SAGE helped make possible the first truly large-scale commercial real-time network: the SABRE computerized airline reservations system&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now [[DARPA]]), and the [[computer network]] that resulted was called the [[ARPANET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Internet|url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml|publisher=[[Internet Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.

In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the [[World Wide Web]], combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like [[Ethernet]] and [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. "Wireless" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

== Unconventional computers ==
{{Main|Human computer}}
{{See also|Harvard Computers}}
A computer does not need to be [[electronics|electronic]], nor even have a [[Central processing unit|processor]], nor [[Random-access memory|RAM]], nor even a [[hard disk]]. While popular usage of the word "computer" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (6th ed, 2007), the word ''computer'' dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to "A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc."&lt;/ref&gt; definition of a computer is literally: "''A device that computes'', especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefreedictionary.com/computer |title=Definition of computer|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any device which ''processes information'' qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Unconventional computing ==
{{further|Unconventional computing}}
Historically, computers evolved from [[mechanical computer]]s and eventually from [[vacuum tube]]s to [[transistor]]s. However, conceptually computational systems as [[Turing complete|flexible]] as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls ([[billiard ball computer]]); an often quoted example.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} More realistically, modern computers are made out of [[transistors]] made of [[photolithography|photolithographed]] [[semiconductors]].

== Future ==
There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as [[optical computing|optical computers]], [[DNA computing|DNA computers]], [[wetware computer|neural computers]], and [[quantum computing|quantum computers]]. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any [[computable function]], and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by [[Shor's algorithm|quantum factoring]]) very quickly.

=== Computer architecture paradigms ===
There are many types of [[computer architecture]]s:
* [[Quantum computer]] vs. [[Chemical computer]]
* [[Scalar processor]] vs. [[Vector processor]]
* [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) computers
* [[Register machine]] vs. [[Stack machine]]
* [[Harvard architecture]] vs. [[von Neumann architecture]]
* [[Cellular architecture]]

Of all these [[abstract machine]]s, a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=II|first1=Joseph D. Dumas|title=Computer Architecture: Fundamentals and Principles of Computer Design|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849327490|page=340|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWaUurOwMPQC&amp;q=quantum+computers&amp;q=quantum%20computers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logic gates]] are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above [[Digital data|digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] paradigms. The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called [[Computer program|programs]] makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from [[calculator]]s. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a [[Turing-complete|minimum capability (being Turing-complete)]] is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore, any type of computer ([[netbook]], [[supercomputer]], [[cellular automaton]], etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]]. Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule based systems and pattern recognition systems. Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop. Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions. Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing.

== Professions and organizations ==
As the use of computers has spread throughout society, there are an increasing number of careers involving computers.

In [[Data governance|Data Governance]] groups, responsibilities for data management are increasingly divided between the business process owners and information technology (IT) departments.  Two functional titles commonly used for these roles are [[Data steward|Data Steward]] and Data Custodian. 

Data Stewards are commonly responsible for data content, context, and associated business rules. Data Custodians are responsible for the safe custody, transport, storage of the data and implementation of business rules.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie Mellon - Information Security Roles and Responsibilities, http://www.cmu.edu/iso/governance/roles/data-custodian.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Policies, Regulations and Rules: Data Management Procedures - REG 08.00.3 - Information Technology'', NC State University, http://www.ncsu.edu/policies/informationtechnology/REG08.00.3.php&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, Data Stewards are responsible for what is stored in a data field, while Data Custodians are responsible for the technical environment and database structure. Common job titles for data custodians are Database Administrator (DBA), Data Modeler, and [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] Developer.

==Data Custodian Responsibilities==
A data custodian ensures:
# Access to the data is authorized and controlled
# Data stewards are identified for each data set
# Technical processes sustain data integrity
# Processes exist for data quality issue resolution in partnership with Data Stewards
# Technical controls safeguard data
# Data added to data sets are consistent with the common data model
# Versions of Master Data are maintained along with the history of changes
# Change management practices are applied in maintenance of the database
# Data content and changes can be audited

The '''Department of Science and Technology''' (DST) is the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] department responsible for scientific research, including [[space]] programmes. The current Minister is [[Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane]].

Much of the department's work is ultimately carried out through various quasi-independent agencies (although still usually government bodies) including: 
* the [[National Research Foundation of South Africa]], which receives a substantial proportion of the DST budget to carry out various research support tasks, including supporting key national research infrastructure ("National Research Facilities"), scientific research grant administration and a student grant scheme;
* the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]], which acts as a quasi-privatised research and development agency with a specific focus on research of application to industry;
* the [[Technology Innovation Agency]], which serves to provide funding to turn innovative research into commercial products;
* the [[South African National Space Agency]], which covers space-related research and development initiatives;
* the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)]], which focuses its research on human health and disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">The '''DigRF''' working group was formed as a [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI Alliance]] (MIPI) [[working group]] in April 2007. The group is focused on developing specifications for wireless mobile [[RFIC]] to base-band IC ([[BBIC]]) interfaces in mobile devices.

The group's current charter is split into short-term and long-term development efforts. The short-term development will focus on a specification targeted for completion by end of 2007 for [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and [[WiMax]] [[air interface]] standards. The longer term development will focus on future air interface standards which promise further improvements in high speed, data optimized traffic. In addition, the future work will seek to harmonize efforts with the MIPI's [[PHY]] and [[UniPro]] working groups.

These specifications will describe the logical, electrical and timing characteristics of the digital RF-BB Interface with sufficient detail to allow physical implementation of the interface, and with sufficient rigor that implementations of the interface from different suppliers are fully compatible at the physical level.

There is DigRF version v1.12 for usage in GSM/EDGE handsets, which was specified in 2004. DigRF v3.09 from the year 2006 with its 312 Mbit/s can additionally handle [[UMTS]]. The present DigRF v4 draft offers Gbit/s bandwidth for LTE and WiMax.

A '''digital divide''' is an [[economic inequality|economic]] and [[social inequality]] with regard to access to, use of, or impact of [[information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="NTIA95"&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). (1995). ''Falling through the net: A survey of the ''have nots'' in rural and urban America''. Retrieved from, http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The divide within countries (such as the [[digital divide in the United States]]) may refer to inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas, usually at different [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] levels or other demographic categories.  The divide between differing countries or regions of the world is referred to as the [[#The global digital divide|global digital divide]],&lt;ref name="NTIA95" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris, P. (2001). [http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/Books/Digital%20Divide.htm ''Digital Divide: Civic Engagement, Information Poverty and the Internet Worldwide''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024044752/http://ksghome.harvard.edu/%7Epnorris/Books/Digital%20Divide.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }}.

==Definitions and usage==
The term ''digital divide'' describes a gap in terms of access to and usage of [[information and communication technology]]. It was traditionally considered to be a question of having or not having access,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but with a global [[mobile phone]] penetration of over 95%,&lt;ref name="ITU-IndividualsUsingTheInternet"/&gt; it is becoming a relative inequality between those who have more and less bandwidth&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; and more or fewer skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MGraham" /&gt; Conceptualizations of the digital divide have been described as "who, with which characteristics, connects how to what":&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
* Who is the subject that connects: individuals, organizations, enterprises, schools, hospitals, countries, etc.
* Which characteristics&amp;nbsp;or attributes are distinguished to describe the divide: income, education, age, geographic location, motivation, reason not to use, etc.
* How sophisticated is the usage: mere access, retrieval, interactivity, intensive and extensive in usage, innovative contributions, etc.
* To what does&amp;nbsp;the subject connect: fixed or mobile, Internet or telephone, digital TV, broadband, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ishti.org/2016/10/17/can-online-degrees-reduce-global-inequalities-in-education/ "Digital Divide and Global Inequalities in Education"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Different authors focus on different aspects, which leads to a large variety of definitions of the digital divide. "For example, counting with only 3 different choices of subjects (individuals, organizations, or countries), each with 4 characteristics (age, wealth, geography, sector), distinguishing between 3 levels of digital adoption (access, actual usage and effective adoption), and 6 types of technologies (fixed phone, mobile... Internet...), already results in 3x4x3x6 = 216 different ways to define the digital divide. Each one of them seems equally reasonable and depends on the objective pursued by the analyst".&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011" /&gt;
The "digital divide" is also referred to by a variety of other terms which have similar meanings, though may have a slightly different emphasis: digital inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/performance/digital-inclusion |title=Dashboard - Digital inclusion |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital participation,&lt;ref&gt;https://digitalparticipation.scot/&lt;/ref&gt; basic digital skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetechpartnership.com/basic-digital-skills/basic-digital-skills-framework/ |title=Tech Partnership Legacy |work=Thetechpartnership.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media literacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research |title=Media literacy |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and digital accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rouse |first=Margaret |url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/digital-accessibility |title=What is digital accessibility? - Definition from WhatIs.com |work=Whatis.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a US-based [[nonprofit organization]], has found the term "digital divide" to be problematic, since there are a multiplicity of divides. Instead, they chosen to use the term "digital inclusion", providing a definition:
Digital Inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure that all individuals and communities, including the most disadvantaged, have access to and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).  This includes 5 elements: 1) affordable, robust broadband internet service; 2) internet-enabled devices that meet the needs of the user; 3) access to digital literacy training; 4) quality technical support; and 5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NDIA |year= 2017 |url= https://www.digitalinclusion.org/definitions/ |accessdate= June 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of connectivity==

===Infrastructure===
The infrastructure by which individuals, households, businesses, and communities connect to the Internet address the physical mediums that people use to connect to the Internet such as desktop computers, laptops, basic mobile phones or [[smartphones]], iPods or other MP3 players, gaming consoles such as Xbox or PlayStation, electronic book readers, and tablets such as iPads.&lt;ref&gt;Zickuher, Kathryn. 2011.

[[File:BandwidthInequality1986-2014.jpg|thumb|300px |The digital divide measured in terms of bandwidth is not closing, but fluctuating up and down. Gini coefficients for telecommunication capacity (in kbit/s) among individuals worldwide&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;]]
Traditionally the nature of the divide has been measured in terms of the existing numbers of subscriptions and digital devices. Given the increasing number of such devices, some have concluded that the digital divide among individuals has increasingly been closing as the result of a natural and almost automatic process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Compaine, B.M. (2001). The digital divide: Facing a crisis or creating a myth? Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = W.H. | last2 = Gillett | first2 = S.E. | last3 = McKnight | first3 = L.W. | last4 = Peltu | first4 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Bridging broadband internet divides | url = | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 28–38 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to persistent lower levels of connectivity among women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with lower incomes, rural residents, and less educated people as evidence that addressing inequalities in access to and use of the medium will require much more than the passing of time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Eszter Hargittai. The Digital Divide and What to Do About It. New Economy Handbook, p. 824, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn zickuhr. Who's not online and why? Pew Research Center, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have measured the digital divide not in terms of technological devices, but in terms of the existing bandwidth per individual (in kbit/s per capita).&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/asi.23020 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/TechInfoInequality.pdf | volume=65 | issue = 4 | title=Technological information inequality as an incessantly moving target: The redistribution of information and communication capacities between 1986 and 2010 | year=2013 | journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | pages=821–835 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | year = 2016 | title = The bad news is that the digital access divide is here to stay: Domestically installed bandwidths among 172 countries for 1986–2014 | url = http://www.martinhilbert.net/the-bad-news-is-that-the-digital-access-divide-is-here-to-stay | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 40 | issue = 6| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As shown in the Figure on the side, the digital divide in kbit/s is not monotonically decreasing, but re-opens up with each new innovation. For example, "the massive diffusion of narrow-band Internet and mobile phones during the late 1990s" increased digital inequality, as well as "the initial introduction of broadband DSL and cable modems during 2003–2004 increased levels of inequality".&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt; This is because a new kind of connectivity is never introduced instantaneously and uniformly to society as a whole at once, but diffuses slowly through social networks. As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed. The most recent increase in digital equality stems from the massive diffusion of the latest digital innovations (i.e. fixed and mobile broadband infrastructures, e.g. [[3G]] and fiber optics [[FTTH]]).&lt;ref&gt;SciDevNet (2014) How mobile phones increased the digital divide; http://www.scidev.net/global/data/scidev-net-at-large/how-mobile-phones-increased-the-digital-divide.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurement methodologies of the digital divide, and more specifically an Integrated Iterative Approach General Framework (Integrated Contextual Iterative Approach – ICI) and the digital divide modeling theory under measurement model DDG (Digital Divide Gap) are  used to analyze the gap existing between developed and developing countries, and the gap among the 27 members-states of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Abdalhakim, Hawaf., (2009). An innovated objective digital divide measure, ''Journal of Communication and Computer'', Volume 6, No.12 (Serial No.61), USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paschalidou, Georgia,  (2011), Digital divide and disparities in the use of new technologies, https://dspace.lib.uom.gr/bitstream/2159/14899/6/PaschalidouGeorgiaMsc2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The bit as the unifying variable ====
[[File:Hilbert DigitalBitsDivide.png|thumb |300px |Fixed-line phone and Internet 2000–2010: subscriptions (top) and kbit/s (bottom) per capita&lt;ref&gt;Figures 11 and 12 in [http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization (1986–2007/2010)"]. Hilbert, Martin. Working paper INF/15-E, International Telecommunications Union. December 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Instead of tracking various kinds of digital divides among fixed and mobile phones, narrow- and broadband Internet, digital TV, etc., it has recently been suggested to simply measure the amount of kbit/s per actor.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertEquip2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01972241003712199 | volume=26 | issue=3 | title=Information Societies or "ICT Equipment Societies?" Measuring the Digital Information-Processing Capacity of a Society in Bits and Bytes | year=2010 | journal=The Information Society | pages=157–178 | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf "Mapping the dimensions and characteristics of the world’s technological communication capacity during the period of digitization"], Martin Hilbert (2011), Presented at the 9th World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Meeting, Mauritius: International Telecommunication Union (ITU); free access to the article can be found here: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/wtim11/documents/inf/015INF-E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has shown that the digital divide in kbit/s per capita is actually widening in relative terms: "While the average inhabitant of the developed world counted with some 40 kbit/s more than the average member of the information society in developing countries in 2001, this gap grew to over 3 Mbit/s per capita in 2010."&lt;ref name="HilbertMapping2011" /&gt; 

The upper graph of the Figure on the side shows that the divide between developed and developing countries has been diminishing when measured in terms of subscriptions per capita. In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="HilbertInfoInequality" /&gt; This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that "the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies".&lt;ref name="ITUmeasuring2012"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf "Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills and digital literacy===
However, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment. There are at least three factors at play: information accessibility, information utilization and information receptiveness. More than just accessibility, individuals need to know how to make use of the information and communication tools once they exist within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Mun-cho, K. &amp; Jong-Kil, K. (2001). Digital divide: conceptual discussions and prospect, In W. Kim, T. Wang Ling, Y.j. Lee &amp; S.S. Park (Eds.), The human society and the Internet: Internet related socio-economic Issues, First International Conference, Seoul, Korea: Proceedings, Springer, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Information professionals have the ability to help bridge the gap by providing reference and information services to help individuals learn and utilize the technologies to which they do have access, regardless of the economic status of the individual seeking help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aqili | first1 = S. | last2 = Moghaddam | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Bridging the digital divide: The role of librarians and information professionals in the third millennium | journal = Electronic Library | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 226–237 | doi = 10.1108/02640470810864118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Internet connectivity can be utilized at a variety of locations such as homes, offices, schools, libraries, public spaces, Internet cafe and others. There are also varying levels of connectivity in rural, suburban, and urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, Gretchen. 2010. Latinos and Digital Technology, 2010. Pew Hispanic Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25013823"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ramalingam A, Kar SS| title=Is there a digital divide among school students? an exploratory study from Puducherry | journal=J Educ Health Promot | year= 2014 | volume= 3 | issue=  | page= 30 | pmid=25013823 | doi=10.4103/2277-9531.131894 | pmc=4089106 | doi-broken-date=2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
[[Common Sense Media]], a nonprofit group based in San Francisco, surveyed almost 1,400 parents and reported in 2011 that 47 percent of families with incomes more than $75,000 had downloaded [[Application software|apps]] for their children, while only 14 percent of families earning less than $30,000 had done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/10/25/app-gap-emerges-highlighting-savvy-mobile-children/ |title=‘App gap’ emerges highlighting savvy mobile children|author= Ryan Kim|journal= GigaOM|date= October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons and correlating variables==

The gap in a digital divide may exist for a number of reasons. Obtaining access to ICTs and using them actively has been linked to a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics: among them income, education, race, gender, geographic location (urban-rural), age, skills, awareness, political, cultural and psychological attitudes.&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawton|first=Tait|title=15 Years of Chinese Internet Usage in 13 Pretty Graphs|url=http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|work=NanjingMarketingGroup.com|publisher=CNNIC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140422192031/http://www.nanjingmarketinggroup.com/blog/15-years-chinese-internet-usage-13-pretty-graphs|archivedate=April 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Wensheng.

As for geographic location, people living in urban centers have more access and show more usage of computer services than those in rural areas. Gender was previously thought to provide an explanation for the digital divide, many thinking ICT were male gendered, but controlled statistical analysis has shown that income, education and employment act as [[confounding variables]] and that women with the same level of income, education and employment actually embrace ICT more than men (see [[ICT4D#Women and ICT4D|Women and ICT4D]]).&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Hilbert | first= Martin | title = Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries?

For example, the [[Digital Divide in Germany|digital divide in Germany]] is unique because it is not largely due to difference in quality of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/sw_2007/papers/schleife.pdf|title=Regional Versus. Individual Aspects of the Digital Divide in Germany|last=Schliefe|first=Katrin|date=February 2007|website=|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One telling fact is that "as income rises so does Internet use ...",  strongly suggesting that the digital divide persists at least in part due to income disparities.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, R.E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science. 178-179. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, a digital divide stems from poverty and the economic barriers that limit resources and prevent people from obtaining or otherwise using newer technologies.

In research, while each explanation is examined, others must be controlled in order to eliminate [[interaction effects]] or [[Mediation (statistics)|mediating variables]],&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mossberger | first1 = Karen | last2 = Tolbert | first2 = Carolina J. | last3 = Gilbert | first3 = Michele | year = 2006 | title = Race, Place, and Information Technology (IT) | url = | journal = Urban Affairs Review | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 583–620 | doi=10.1177/1078087405283511}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these explanations are meant to stand as general trends, not direct causes. Each component can be looked at from different angles, which leads to a myriad of ways to look at (or define) the digital divide. For example, measurements for the intensity of usage, such as incidence and frequency, vary by study. Some report usage as access to Internet and ICTs while others report usage as having previously connected to the Internet. Some studies focus on specific technologies, others on a combination (such as [[Infostate]], proposed by [[Orbicom-UNESCO]], the [[Digital Opportunity Index]], or [[ITU]]'s [[ICT Development Index]]). Based on different answers to the questions of who, with which kinds of characteristics, connects how and why, to what there are hundreds of alternatives ways to define the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt; "The new consensus recognizes that the key question is not how to connect people to a specific network through a specific device, but how to extend the expected gains from new ICTs".&lt;ref&gt;Galperin, H. (2010). Goodbye digital divide, Hello digital confusion? A critical embrace of the emerging ICT4D consensus. Information Technologies and International Development, 6 Special Edition, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the desired impact and "the end justifies the definition" of the digital divide.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"/&gt;

During the mid-1990s the US Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications &amp; Information Administration (NTIA) began publishing reports about the Internet and access to and usage of the resource.

In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.

Overcoming the divide 
See also|Information and communication technologies for development}}

An individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the "magical number" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide? Modeling Income Related Structural Challenges of Technology Diffusion in Latin America| doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019| journal = World Development| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 756–770| year = 2010| url = http://martinhilbert.net/CheapEnoughWD_Hilbert_pre-print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that people consider ICT expenditure of US$120 per year as a basic necessity. Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.

Furthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay&lt;/ref&gt; It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm "UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.

In the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme]] launched its Online Volunteering service,&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.&lt;ref&gt;Acevedo, Manuel. 2005. [http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org/fileadmin/docdb/pdf/2006/Acevedo_Volunteering_in_the_Information_Society_2005.pdf%20 Volunteering in the information society], Research paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media websites serve as both manifestations of and means by which to combat the digital divide. The former describes phenomena such as the divided users demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites host thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.

=== Libraries ===
[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]

Attempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where very low access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an "online indigenous digital library as part of public library services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = | journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30–9 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.

To address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] began the Gates Library Initiative. The Gates Foundation focused on providing more than just access, they placed computers and provided training in libraries. In this manner if users began to struggle while using a computer, the user was in a setting where assistance and guidance was available. Further, the Gates Library Initiative was "modeled on the old-fashioned life preserver: The support needs to be around you to keep you afloat."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends. Prior conditions in Kenya—lack of funding, language and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement for those citizens. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began. In the early 2000s, The Carnegie Foundation funded a revitalization project through the Kenya National Library Service (KNLS). Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies (ICT) to their patrons. In 2012, public libraries in the Busia and Kiberia communities introduced technology resources to supplement curriculum for primary schools. By 2013, the program expanded into ten schools.&lt;ref&gt;Pingo, Z. B. (2015). Transition from Camel Libraries to Digital Technologies in Kenya Public Libraries. Public Library Quarterly, 34(1), 63-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective use==
[[Community Informatics]] (CI) provides a somewhat different approach to addressing the digital divide by focusing on issues of "use" rather than simply "access".   CI is concerned with ensuring the opportunity not only for ICT access at the community level but also, according to [[Michael Gurstein]], that the means for the "effective use" of ICTs for community betterment and empowerment are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the digital divide|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1107/1027|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurstein has also extended the discussion of the digital divide to include issues around access to and the use of "open data" and coined the term "data divide" to refer to this issue area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|title=Open data: Empowering the empowered or effective data use for everyone?|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/3316/2764|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Social capital===
Once an individual is connected, Internet connectivity and ICTs can enhance his or her future social and cultural capital. [[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites. Once an individual has access to connectivity, obtains infrastructure by which to connect, and can understand and use the information that ICTs and connectivity provide, that individual is capable of becoming a "digital citizen".&lt;ref name="MossbergerRacePlace"/&gt;

=== Economic disparity ===
In the United States, research provided by Sungard Availability Services notes a direct correlation between a company's access to technological advancements and its overall success in bolstering the economy.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2016/07/16/lack-of-digital-cloud-opportunities-is-actually-embarrassing-for-employees-survey-suggests/|title=Lack Of Digital, Cloud Opportunities Is Actually Embarrassing For Employees, Survey Suggests|last=McKendrick|first=Joe|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The study, which includes over 2,000 IT executives and staff officers, indicates that 69 percent of employees feel they do not have access to sufficient technology in order to make their jobs easier, while 63 percent of them believe the lack of technological mechanisms hinders their ability to develop new work skills.&lt;ref name=Forbes1/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Additional analysis provides more evidence to show how the digital divide also affects the economy in places all over the world. A BCG Report suggests that in countries like Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K., the digital connection among communities is made easier, allowing for their populations to obtain a much larger share of the economies via digital business.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/22/the-real-threat-to-economic-growth-is-the-digital-divide/|title=The Real Threat to Economic Growth Is the Digital Divide|last=Foroohar|first=Rana|work=Time|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In fact, in these places, populations hold shares approximately 2.5 percentage points higher.&lt;ref name=EcoGrowth/&gt; During a meeting with the United Nations a Bangladesh representative expressed his concern that poor and undeveloped countries would be left behind due to a lack of funds to bridge the digital gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing Digital Divide Critical to Social, Economic Development, Delegates Say at Second Committee Debate on Information and Communications Technologies {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/gaef3432.doc.htm|website=www.un.org|accessdate=September 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The digital divide also impacts children's ability to learn and grow in low-income school districts. Without Internet access, students are unable to cultivate necessary tech skills in order to understand today's dynamic economy.&lt;ref name=RichPoor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/digital-divide-the-technology-gap-between-rich-and-poor|title=Digital Divide: The Technology Gap between the Rich and Poor|website=Digital Responsibility|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Federal Communication Commission's Broadband Task Force created a report showing that about 70% of teachers give students homework that demand access to broadband.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neatoday.org/2016/04/20/the-homework-gap/|title=The Homework Gap: The 'Cruelest Part of the Digital Divide'|date=April 20, 2016|website=NEA Today|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Even more, approximately 65% of young scholars use the Internet at home to complete assignments as well as connect with teachers and other students via discussion boards and shared files.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;A recent study indicates that practically 50% of students say that they are unable to finish their homework due to an inability to either connect to the Internet, or in some cases, find a computer.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;This has led to a new revelation: 42% of students say they received a lower grade because of this disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Hwk-Gap"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Finally, according to research conducted by the Center for American Progress, "if the United States were able to close the educational achievement gaps between native-born white children and black and Hispanic children, the U.S. economy would be 5.8 percent—or nearly $2.3 trillion—larger in 2050".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.net-ref.com/whitepaper-connected-classroom/|title=The Digital Divide in the Age of the Connected Classroom {{!}} NetRef|date=January 14, 2016|work=NetRef|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographic differences ===
Furthermore, according to the 2012 Pew Report "Digital Differences", a mere 62% of households who make less than $30,000 a year use the Internet, while 90% of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 had access.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Studies also show that only 51% of Hispanics and 49% of African Americans have high-speed Internet at home. This is compared to the 66% of Caucasians that too have high-speed Internet in their households.&lt;ref name=RichPoor/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Overall, 10% of all Americans don't have access to high-speed Internet, an equivalent of almost 34 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/technology/the-challenges-of-closing-the-digital-divide.html|title=The Challenges of Closing the Digital Divide|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|date=June 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Supplemented reports from the Guardian demonstrate the global effects of limiting technological developments in poorer nations, rather than simply the effects in the United States. Their study shows that the rapid digital expansion excludes those who find themselves in the lower class. 60% of the world's population, almost 4 billion people, have no access to the Internet and are thus left worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/13/internet-not-conquered-digital-divide-rich-poor-world-bank-report|title=Spread of internet has not conquered 'digital divide' between rich and poor – report|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=January 13, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Knowledge divide===
Since gender, age, racial, income, and educational gaps in the digital divide have lessened compared to past levels, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a [[knowledge divide]].&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; A knowledge divide concerning technology presents the possibility that the gap has moved beyond access and having the resources to connect to ICTs to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected.&lt;ref&gt;Sciadas, George. (2003). Monitoring the Digital Divide…and Beyond. [[Orbicom-UNESCO|Orbicom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second-level digital divide===
The second-level digital divide, also referred to as the production gap, describes the gap that separates the consumers of content on the Internet from the producers of content.&lt;ref name="Reilley"&gt;Reilley, Collen A. Teaching Wikipedia as a Mirrored Technology. First Monday, Vol. 16, No. 1-3, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the technological digital divide is decreasing between those with access to the Internet and those without, the meaning of the term digital divide is evolving.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Graham | first1 = M.| title = Time machines and virtual portals: The spatialities of the digital divide| doi = 10.1177/146499341001100303| journal = Progress in Development Studies| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 211–227|date=July 2011| citeseerx = 10.1.1.659.9379}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, digital divide research has focused on accessibility to the Internet and Internet consumption. However, with more and more of the population with access to the Internet, researchers are examining how people use the Internet to create content and what impact socioeconomics are having on user behavior.&lt;ref name="MGraham"&gt;Graham, Mark (2014).

New applications have made it possible for anyone with a computer and an Internet connection to be a creator of content, yet the majority of user generated content available widely on the Internet, like public blogs, is created by a small portion of the Internet using population. [[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.&lt;ref name="Reilley" /&gt; Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.

Some of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.&lt;ref name="Schradie"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | format = PDF | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status. Users of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in content creation due to disadvantages in education and lack of the necessary free time for the work involved in blog or web site creation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Schradie" /&gt;  Additionally, there is evidence to support the existence of the second-level digital divide at the K-12 level based on how educators' use technology for instruction.&lt;ref name="Reinhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reinhart | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = E. | last3 = Toriskie | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = K-12 Teachers: Technology Use and the Second Level Digital Divide | url = | journal = Journal of Instructional Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 3/4| page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools' economic factors have been found to explain variation in how teachers use technology to promote higher-order thinking skills.&lt;ref name="Reinhart" /&gt;

The global digital divide describes global disparities, primarily between [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], in regards to access to computing and information resources such as the [[Internet]] and the opportunities derived from such access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lu | first1 = Ming-te | year = 2001 | title = Digital divide in developing countries | url = http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Global Information Technology Management | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115838/http://www.uncg.edu/bae/jgitm/Vol4no3.pdf | archivedate = August 26, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with a smaller [[unit of analysis]], this gap describes an inequality that exists, referencing a global scale.

The Internet is expanding very quickly, and not all countries—especially developing countries—are able to keep up with the constant changes. The term "digital divide" doesn't necessarily mean that someone doesn’t have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.

In fact, there is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only 3 countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt; This concentration is not new, as historically only 10 countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).&lt;ref name="HilbertBitsDivide"/&gt;

===Versus the digital divide===
The global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide, the focus is set on the fact that "Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world"&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized in regard to the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.

The global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[north-south divide]] of "northern" wealthier nations and "southern" poorer ones.

===Obstacles to a solution===
Some people argue that basic necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:
;Physical access 
Involves "the distribution of ICT devices per capita…and land lines per thousands".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations. 
;Financial access
The cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5" /&gt;
Financial access and "the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap" &lt;ref&gt;“Digital Divide.” The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Socio-demographic access
Empirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.&lt;ref name="HilbertDigDiv2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715–736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HilbertWD38,5"/&gt; Others, like gender, don't seem to have much of an independent effect after controlling for income, education and employment.&lt;ref name=HilbertGend2011 /&gt;
;Cognitive access
In order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.  
;Design access
Computers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.&lt;/ref&gt;  
;Institutional access
In illustrating institutional access, Wilson states "the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercafés, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited".&lt;ref name=Wilson-2004/&gt;{{rp|303}} 
;Political access
Guillen &amp; Suarez argue that "democratic political regimes enable a faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes".&lt;ref name=Guillen-2005/&gt;{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.  Recently situations in Iran and China have denied people the ability to access certain websites and disseminate information.  Iran has prohibited the use of high-speed Internet in the country and has removed many satellite dishes in order to prevent the influence of [[Western culture]], such as music and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/oct/18/news.iran|first1=Robert|last1=Tait|date=July 23, 2006|title=Iran bans fast internet to cut west's influence|work=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Cultural access
Many experts claim that bridging the digital divide is not sufficient and that the images and language needed to be conveyed in a language and images that can be read across different cultural lines.&lt;ref name=Carr-2007/&gt; A 2013 study conducted by Pew Research Center noted how participants taking the survey in Spanish were nearly twice as likely to not use the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who’s Not Online and Why|date=September 25, 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

In the early 21st century, residents of developed countries enjoy many Internet services which are not yet widely available in developing countries, including:

* In tandem with the above point, mobile phones and small electronic communication devices;
* E-communities and social-networking;
* Fast broadband Internet connections, enabling advanced Internet applications;&lt;ref&gt;This graphic illustrates the difference in [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22ICT,%20Fixed%20Broadband,%20Subscribers%20per%20100,%20History%20and%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=1&amp;Dim1=%22Afr-SubSahar%22,%22EU27%22&amp;File=0 fixed broadband penetration (History and Forecast)] between the European Union and Sub-Saharan Africa from [[International Futures]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Affordable and widespread Internet access, either through [[personal computer]]s at [[home]] or work, through public terminals in [[public library|public libraries]] and [[Internet cafe]]s, and through [[wireless access point]]s;
*[[E-commerce]] enabled by efficient electronic payment networks like [[credit card]]s and reliable [[shipping]] services;
*[[Virtual globe]]s featuring street maps searchable down to individual street addresses and detailed satellite and aerial photography;
* Online [[research]] systems like [[LexisNexis]] and [[ProQuest]] which enable users to peruse [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] articles that may be centuries old, without having to leave home;
* Electronic readers such as Kindle, Sony Reader, Samsung Papyrus and Iliad by iRex Technologies;
*[[Price engine]]s like [[Google Shopping]] which help [[consumer]]s find the best possible online [[price]]s, and similar services like [[ShopLocal]] which find the best possible prices at local [[Retailing|retailer]]s;
*[[Electronic services delivery]] of [[government]] services, such as the ability to pay [[tax]]es, [[fee]]s, and [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] online.
* Further civic engagement through e-government and other sources such as finding information about candidates regarding political situations.

==Global solutions==
{{Main|Information and Communication Technologies for Development}}

There are four specific arguments why it is important to "bridge the gap":&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"&gt;Digital Divide - ICT Information Communications Technology - 50x15 Initiative. (March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

*Economic equality – For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency situation, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civil life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Social mobility – Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Democracy – Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|first=|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=http://www.sior.ub.edu|archive-date=September 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;
*Economic growth – It is believed that less developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries are able to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

While these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.&lt;ref name="internetworldstats.com"/&gt;

Using previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma &amp; Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, "internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.&lt;ref name=James-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54–61 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, computer literacy, and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.

It has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, "The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...Government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, "If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that "in developing nations…foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all important".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: "invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations".&lt;ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/&gt;{{rp|111}}

There are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that "the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}}

Other proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries, so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their own problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet cafés to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.

At the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for "power") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech "CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&amp;cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their own content, one scholar has posited that social media—like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—may be useful tools in closing the divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, "the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide".&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Facebook’s statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics "Facebook Statistics"], 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164409/http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics |date=October 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website.&lt;ref name=FacebookStats-2011/&gt; The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt; Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.&lt;ref name="AliHRJ"/&gt;

Some cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 "Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 "City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free Basics===
{{Main|Free Basics}}

Free Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&amp;oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a "human right", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.

"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.

===Satellite constellations===

Several projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest hurdle of these projects is the astronomical financial and logistical costs of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said "It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this." Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.

===One Laptop per Child===

[[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"&gt;[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced "XO" laptops (dubbed the "$100 laptop", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet—as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.&lt;ref name="wiki.laptop.org"/&gt;

Several of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:&lt;ref name=WSIS-03&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html "Declaration of Principles"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.
:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.
:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.
:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.
:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.
:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.
:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.
:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.
:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.
:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">The use of computers (including devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[laptop]]s) by children and adolescents before bed has been associated with a reduction in the hours of [[sleep]] experienced by frequent users, along with a decreased quality of sleep, in most cases. The results of computer use at night have been linked with tiredness.

A 2010 review concluded that "the use of electronic media by children and adolescents does have a negative impact on their sleep, although the precise effects and mechanisms remain unclear", with the most consistent results associating excessive media use with shorter sleep duration and delayed bed times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain |first=Neralie |last2=Gradisar |first2=Michael |title=Electronic media use and sleep in school-aged children and adolescents: a review |journal=Sleep Medicine |date=15 February 2010 |volume=11 |pages=735–742 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 meta-analysis found that "Bedtime access and use of media devices was significantly associated with inadequate sleep quantity; poor sleep quality; and excessive daytime sleepiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Ben|last2=Rees|first2=Philippa|last3=Hale|first3=Lauren|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Darsharna|last5=Paradkar|first5=Mandar S.|title=Association Between Portable Screen-Based Media Device Access or Use and Sleep Outcomes|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=1 December 2016|volume=170|issue=12|pages=1202|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2341|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60839202/poi160064.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends screen time for children be limited for multiple reasons, among them that "Too much screen time can also harm the amount and quality of sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy of Pediatrics Announces New Recommendations for Children’s Media Use|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-new-recommendations-for-childrens-media-use.aspx|website=www.aap.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many apps promise to improve sleep by filtering out blue light produced by media devices; there have been no large studies to assess whether such apps work. Some users express dissatisfaction with the resultant orange tint of screens. Some people use blue-blocking glasses, for the purpose of attempting to block out blue light both from electronic media and from other artificial light sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apps Can Cut Blue Light From Devices, But Do They Help You Sleep?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/27/561740031/apps-can-cut-blue-light-from-devices-but-do-they-help-you-sleep|accessdate=13 March 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Emergency Disconnect Package''' (EDP) is a piece of equipment used in the drilling and work-over (servicing or modification) of deep sea oil &amp; gas wells, by [[Mobile offshore drilling unit|Mobile Offshore Drilling Rigs]] (MODU's) and [[Well intervention|Well Intervention Vessels]] (WIV's). The EDP is designed for use in an emergency, when the MODU or WIV needs to quickly disconnect, and move away from the oil/gas well that it is drilling or working-over.  Examples of when this might be necessary include unexpected [[extreme weather]] that exceeds the MODU/Vessel's capability to maintain its position. 

Under normal operating conditions, the MODU/WIV (which is floating on the sea surface) is connected to the oil/gas well (which is drilled in the sea bed) by a vertical (or near-vertical) piece of steel pipe, called a [[marine riser]].  Tools and fluids are moved within the marine riser as required to/from the well. At the bottom of the marine riser, the EDP and other components that connect the riser to the well and allow the well to be shut-in when required, constitute a '[[Lower riser package|Lower Riser Package]]' (LRP). 

When required to do so, the EDP disconnects from the LRP and isolates the riser from the environment. Thus the EDP allows the MODU/WIV to safely and quickly disconnect from the [[Subsea (technology)|subsea well]] and move away in an emergency.  The EDP is designed to carry out its function while under load with a high disconnection angle.

An EDP consists of a connector to the rest of the LRP, an [[isolation valve]], an accumulator, a subsea control module and a connection point at the top for connection to the riser pipe. A production retainer valve shuts in the riser and the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] master valve shuts in the riser. A crossover valve allows circulation of the riser after disconnection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">An '''excitation filter''' is a high quality optical-glass filter commonly used in [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] and [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] applications for selection of the excitation wavelength of light from a light source. Most excitation filters select light of relatively short wavelengths from an excitation light source, as only those wavelengths would carry enough energy to cause the object the microscope is examining to fluoresce sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Light with shorter wavelengths have higher energy, according to the Planck equation &lt;math&gt;E = hc/ \lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The excitation filters used may come in two main types — '''short pass filters''' and '''band pass filters'''.&lt;ref name="Reichman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Reichman| first = Jay| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Handbook of Optical Filters for Fluorescence Microscopy| work = | publisher = Chroma Technology Corp.| date = June 1998| url = http://depts.washington.edu/keck/handbook3.pdf| format = | doi = | accessdate = 25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of these filters exist in the form of '''notch filters''' or deep blocking filters (commonly employed as [[emission filters]]). Other forms of excitation filters include the use of monochromators, wedge prisms coupled with a narrow slit (for selection of the excitation light) and the use of holographic diffraction gratings, etc. [for beam diffraction of white laser light into the required excitation wavelength (selected for by a narrow slit)].

An excitation filter is commonly packaged with an emission filter and a dichroic beam splitter in a cube so that the group is inserted together into the microscope. The dichroic beam splitter controls which wavelengths of light go to their respective filter.&lt;ref name="Reichman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakowicz| first = Joseph R.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy| publisher = Springer Science+Business Media| series = | volume = | edition = 3rd| date = | location = New York| pages = 41| language = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-PSybuLNxcAC&amp;pg=PA41| doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''FIRST Global''' (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a [[trade name]] for a nonprofit organization, the International First Committee Association. It promotes [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education and careers for youth through Olympics-style robotics competitions called the FIRST Global Challenge. It was founded by [[Dean Kamen]] in 2016 as an expansion of [[FIRST]], an organization with similar objectives. 

== History ==
FIRST Global is a [[trade name]] for the International First Committee Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Haiti Students Compete in First Global Robot Olympics in DC| url=http://www.lunionsuite.com/haiti-compete-first-robot-olympics/| work=L'union Suite| date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit corporation based in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], with a [[501(c)3]] designation from the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unrated Profile for International First Committee Association |url=https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&amp;ein=811060352 |publisher=Charity Navigator |accessdate=July 23, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by the co-founder of FIRST, Dean Kamen, with the objective of promoting STEM education and careers in the developing world through Olympics-style robotics competitions.

Each year, FIRST Global announces the host city of the next year's Challenge during that year's closing ceremony. For example, during the closing ceremony of the 2017 FIRST Global Challenge, entrepreneur Ricardo Salinas, a founding member of FIRST Global, announced that [[Mexico City]] would host the 2018 FIRST Global Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://first.global/press-releases/students-from-160-nations-to-reconvene-a-year-from-now-in-mexico-city-for-the-second-iteration-of-the-first-global-challenge/ |title=Students from 160 Nations to Reconvene a Year from Now in Mexico City for the Second Iteration of the FIRST Global Challenge – FIRST Global |website=first.global |language=en-US |access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''FinTS''' ('''Financial Transaction Services'''), formerly known as '''HBCI''' ('''Home Banking Computer Interface'''), is a bank-independent protocol for online banking, developed and used by [[Germany|German]] banks.

HBCI was originally designed by the two German banking groups [[Sparkasse]] and [[Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken]] and German higher-level associations as the [[Association of German Banks]] (in German: Bundesverband deutscher Banken e.V.). The result of this effort was an open protocol specification, which is publicly available. The standardisation effort was necessary to replace the huge number of deprecated homemade software clients and servers (some of them still using [[Bildschirmtext|BTX]] emulation).
While IFX (Interactive Financial Exchange), [[Open Financial Exchange|OFX]] (Open Financial Exchange) and [[Secure electronic transaction|SET]] (Secure Electronic Transaction) are tailored for the North American market, HBCI is designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

The FinTS-specification is publicly available on a website run by the ZKA ([[Central Credit Committee]]).

==Features==
* Support for online-banking using [[Personal Identification Number|PIN]]/[[Transaction authentication number|TAN]] one time passwords.
* Support for online-banking with [[SWIFT]].
* [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] encryption and signatures.
* Making use of [[XML]] and [[SOAP]] for data-exchange, encryption and signatures.
* Implemented on top of [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[SMTP]] as communication layer.
* Multibanking: The software clients are designed to support accounts on multiple banking companies.
* Platform Independence: The specification allows software development for various types of clients.
* Storage of the encryption keys on an external physical device (smart card) for improved security.
* Possibility to use so called "Secoder" smart card readers to allow the user to cross check the transaction data on a secure device before signing it to uncover manipulations caused by [[malware]]. To use Secoder, the bank as well as the home banking software have to support the Secoder protocol extension of FinTS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starmoney.de/index.php?id=453&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=1649&amp;L=&amp;cHash=2a3bc8d542535c02b8728152bd9f58ec Secoder 2.0-Standard in StarMoney] starmoney.de, Star Finanz-Software Entwicklung und Vertriebs GmbH, Retrieved on November 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbci-zka.de/dokumente/spezifikation_deutsch/fintsv3/FinTS_3.0_Security_Alternative_Sicherheitsverfahren_Rel_20130122_final_version.pdf ZKA: Spezifikation FinTS 3.0 Alternative ZKA Sicherheitsverfahren] (PDF; 1,2&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

HBCI has been superseded by its successor FinTS, and as of 2011, 2000 financial institutions in Germany are supporting FinTS.

==Versions==
=== HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN ===
'''HBCI 2.2 PIN/TAN''' (or '''HBCI+''') is an extension to HBCI that added a security method based on [[Personal Identification Number|PIN]]s and [[Transaction authentication number|TAN]]s, which had already been in use with [[bildschirmtext|BTX]] and [[web banking]].

=== FinTS 3.0 ===
For version '''3.0''', which formally introduced the PIN/TAN method, the specification was renamed to '''FinTS''', whereas the original DSA- and RSA-based security method retained the name '''HBCI'''.

=== FinTS 4.0 ===
In version '''4.0''', the basic message syntax was switched over to [[XML]]. Further, the number of roundtrips necessary was reduced, allowing asynchronous communication (e.g. via [[SMTP]]) for simple transaction dialogues.

'''ISO/TC 37''' is a technical [[committee]] within the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) that prepares [[Technical standard|standards]] and other [[documents]] concerning [[methodology]] and principles for [[terminology]] and [[language resources]].

'''Title: Terminology and other language and content resources'''

'''Scope: [[Standardization]] of principles, methods and applications relating to [[terminology]] and other [[language]] and content [[resources]] in the [[contexts]] of [[multilingual]] [[communication]] and cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]'''

ISO/TC 37 is a so-called "horizontal committee", providing guidelines for all other technical committees that develop standards on how to manage their terminological problems. However, the standards developed by ISO/TC 37 are not restricted to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. Collaboration with [[industry]] is sought to ensure that the requirements and needs from all possible users of standards concerning terminology, language and structured content are duly and timely addressed.

Involvement in standards development is open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and requests can be made to the TC through any liaison or member organization (see the list of current members and liaisons of ISO/TC 37:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48104&lt;/ref&gt;)

ISO/TC 37 standards are therefore fundamental and should form the basis for many [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], [[translation]], and other [[industry]] [[Industrial application|applications]].

==ISO/TC 37 "Terminology and other language and content resources"==
International Standards are developed by [[expert]]s from [[industry]], [[academia]] and [[business]] who are [[delegates]] of their national standards institution or another [[organization]] in liaison. Involvement, therefore, is principally open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. They are based on consensus among those national standards institutes who collaborate in the respective committee by way of membership.

ISO/TC 37 develops [[International Standards]] concerning:
* terminological principles and methods
* vocabulary of terminology and language resource management
* terminology work
* preparation and management of language resources
* preparation and layout of terminology standards
* [[computer]]ized terminography and [[lexicography]]
* terminology [[documentation]]
* coding and [[code]]s in the field of terminology and other language resources
* applications of terminology and other language resources in [[language engineering]] and [[content management]]
* translation, interpreting and related technology

ISO/TC 37 looks upon a long [[history]] of terminology unification activities. In the past, terminology experts - even more so experts of terminology [[theory]] and methodology - had to struggle for wide recognition. Today their [[expertise]] is sought in many application areas, especially in various fields of standardization. The emerging multilingual [[information society]] and [[knowledge society]] will depend on reliable [[Digital data|digital]] content. [[Terminology]] is indispensable here. This is because terminology plays a crucial role wherever and whenever specialized [[information]] and [[knowledge]] is being prepared (e.g. in [[research and development]]), used (e.g. in specialized [[Textbook|texts]]), recorded and processed (e.g. in data banks), passed on (via [[training]] and [[teaching]]), implemented (e.g. in technology and knowledge transfer), or translated and interpreted. In the age of [[globalization]] the need for methodology standards concerning multilingual [[Digital data|digital]] [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] is increasing - ISO/TC 37 has developed over the years the [[expertise]] for methodology standards for [[science]] and [[technology]] related content in textual form.

==Terminology standardization==
The beginnings of terminology standardization are closely linked to the standardization efforts of IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]], founded in 1906) and ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]], founded in 1946).

A terminology standard according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Guide 2 (1996) is defined as "standard that is concerned with terms, usually accompanied by their [[definition]]s, and sometimes by explanatory notes, [[illustration]]s, examples, etc."

ISO 1087-1:2000 defines [[terminology]] as ''"set of designations belonging to one special language" and designations as "[[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of a [[concept]] by a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] which denotes it".'' Here, concept representation goes beyond terms (being only linguistic signs), which is also supported by the state-of-the-art of terminology science, according to which terminology has three major functions:

# basic elements carrying meaning in [[Domain Name System|domain]] [[communication]],
# ordering of scientific-technical [[knowledge]] at the level of concepts,
# access to other representations of specialized information and knowledge.

The above indicates that terminological [[data]] (comprising various kinds of knowledge representation) possibly have a much more fundamental role in domain-related information and knowledge than commonly understood.

Today, terminology standardization can be subdivided into two distinct activities:
* standardization of terminologies,
* standardization of terminological principles and methods.

The two are mutually [[interdependent]], since the [[standardization]] of terminologies would not result in high-quality terminological data, if certain common principles, rules and methods are not observed. On the other hand, these standardized terminological principles, rules and methods must reflect the state-of-the-art of theory and methodology development in those domains, in which terminological data have to be standardized in connection with the formulation of subject standards.

Terminology gained a special position in the field of standardization at large, which is defined as ''"activity of establishing, with regard to actual or potential [[problem]]s, provisions for common and repeated use, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context"'' (ISO/IEC 1996). Every technical committee or sub-committee or working group has to standardize subject matters, define and standardize its respective terminology. There is a consensus that terminology standardization precedes subject standardization (or "subject standardization requires terminology standardization").

==History of ISO/TC 37==
ISO/TC 37 was put into operation in 1952 in order "to find out and formulate general principles of terminology and terminological lexicography" (as terminography was called at that time).

The [[history]] of terminology standardization proper - if one excludes earlier attempts in the field of [[metrology]] - started in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which was founded in [[London]] in 1906 following a recommendation passed at the International Electrical Congress, held in [[St. Louis]], United States, on 15 September 1904, to the extent that: ''"...steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the [[nomenclature]] and ratings of [[electric]]al [[Electrical equipment|apparatus]] and [[machinery]]".'' From the very beginning, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] considered it its foremost task to standardize the terminology of electrotechnology for the sake of the quality of its subject standards, and soon embarked upon the International Electrotechnical [[Vocabulary]] (IEV), whose first edition, based on many individual terminology standards, was published in 1938. The IEV is still being continued today, covering 77 chapters as parts of the International Standard series IEC 60050. The IEV [[Online]] [[Database]] can be accessed on Electropedia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427022958/http://www.electropedia.org/ |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the International Federation of Standardizing Associations (ISA, founded in 1926), made a similar experience. But it went a step further and - triggered by the publication of [[Eugen Wüster]]'s book "Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik" [International standardization of technical language] (Wüster 1931) - established in 1936 the Technical Committee ISA/TC 37 "Terminology" for the sake of formulating general principles and rules for terminology standardization.

ISA/TC 37 conceived a scheme of four classes of recommendations for terminology standardization mentioned below, but the [[Second World War]] interrupted its [[Innovator|pioneering]] work. Nominally, ISO/TC 37 was established from the very beginning of ISO in 1946, but it was decided to re-activate it only in 1951 and the Committee started operation in 1952. Since then until 2009 the secretariat of ISO/TC 37 has been held by the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm),&lt;ref name="infoterm"&gt;http://www.infoterm.org&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] Austria. Infoterm,&lt;ref name="infoterm" /&gt; an [[international non-governmental organization]] based in Austria, continues to collaborate as a [[twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]. After this the administration went to CNIS (China).

==Objective of ISO/TC 37==
To prepare standards specifying principles and methods for the preparation and [[management]] of language resources within the framework of standardization and related activities. Its technical work results in [[International Standards]] (and Technical Reports) covering terminological principles and methods as well as various aspects of [[computer-assisted]] terminography. ISO/TC 37 is not responsible for the co-ordination of the terminology standardizing activities of other ISO/TCs.

Computer [[software]] is said to have '''Internal Documentation''' if the notes on how and why various parts of code operate is included within the [[source code]] as comments.  It is often combined with meaningful [[variable (programming)|variable]] names with the intention of providing potential future programmers a means of understanding the workings of the code.

This contrasts with external [[documentation]], where programmers keep their notes and explanations in a separate document.

Internal documentation has become increasingly popular as it cannot be lost, and any programmer working on the code is immediately made aware of its existence and has it readily available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6888">The '''Internationalization Tag Set''' ('''ITS''') is a set of attributes and elements designed to provide [[internationalization and localization]] support in [[XML]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITS specification identifies concepts (called "ITS data categories") which are important for internationalization and localization. It also defines implementations of these concepts through a set of elements and attributes grouped in the ITS namespace. XML developers can use this namespace to integrate internationalization features directly into their own XML schemas and documents.

==Overview==

ITS v1.0 includes seven data categories:

* '''Translate''': Defines what parts of a document are translatable or not.
* '''Localization Note''': Provides alerts, hints, instructions, and other information to help the localizers or the translators.
* '''Terminology''': Indicates parts of the documents that are terms and optionally pointers to information about these terms.
* '''Directionality''': Indicates what type of display directionality should be applied to parts of the document.
* '''Ruby''': Indicates what parts of the document should be displayed as ruby text. ([[Ruby character|Ruby]] is a short run of text alongside a base text, typically used in East Asian documents to indicate pronunciation or to provide a brief annotation).
* '''Language Information''': Identifies the language of the different parts of the document.
* '''Elements Within Text''': Indicates how elements should be treated with regard to linguistic segmentation.

The vocabulary is designed to work on two different fronts: First by providing markup usable directly in the XML documents. Secondly, by offering a way to indicate if there are parts of a given markup that correspond to some of the ITS data categories and should be treated as such by ITS processors.

ITS applies to both new document types as well as existing ones. It also applies to both markups without any internationalization features as well as the class of documents already supporting some internationalization or localization-related functions.

ITS can be specified using '''global rules''' and '''local rules'''.

* The global rules are expressed anywhere in the document (embedded global rules), or even outside the document (external global rules), using the &lt;code&gt;its:rules&lt;/code&gt; element.
* The local rules are expressed by specialized attributes (and sometimes elements) specified inside the document instance, at the location where they apply.

==Examples==

===Translate data category===

In the following ITS markup example, the elements and attributes with the &lt;code&gt;its&lt;/code&gt; prefix are part of the ITS namespace. The &lt;code&gt;its:rules&lt;/code&gt; element lists the different rules to apply to this file. There is one &lt;code&gt;its:translateRule&lt;/code&gt; rule that indicates that any content inside the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element should not be translated.

The &lt;code&gt;its:translate&lt;/code&gt; attributes used in some elements are utilised to override the global rule. Here, to make translatable the content of &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and to make non-translatable the text "faux pas".

pas&lt;/span&gt; to start a dissertation on the origin of modern novel without 
mentioning the &lt;tl&gt;HKLM of GFDL&lt;/tl&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Localization Note data category===

In the following ITS markup example, the &lt;code&gt;its:locNote&lt;/code&gt; element specifies that any node corresponding to the [[XPath|XPath expression]] &lt;code&gt;"//msg/data"&lt;/code&gt; has an associated note. The location of that note is expressed by the &lt;code&gt;locNotePointer&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which holds a relative XPath expression  pointing to the node where the note is, here &lt;code&gt;="../notes"&lt;/code&gt;.

Note also the use of the &lt;code&gt;its:translate&lt;/code&gt; attribute to mark the &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; elements as non-translatable.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;Res xmlns:its="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its"&gt;
 &lt;prolog&gt;
  &lt;its:rules version="1.0"&gt;
   &lt;its:translateRule selector="//msg/notes" translate="no"/&gt;
   &lt;its:locNoteRule locNoteType="description" selector="//msg/data" locNotePointer="../notes"/&gt;
  &lt;/its:rules&gt;
 &lt;/prolog&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;msg id="FileNotFound"&gt;
   &lt;notes&gt;Indicates that the resource file {0} could not be loaded.&lt;/notes&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;Cannot find the file {0}.&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/msg&gt;
  &lt;msg id="DivByZero"&gt;
   &lt;notes&gt;A division by 0 was going to be computed.&lt;/notes&gt;
   &lt;data&gt;Invalid parameter.&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/msg&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/Res&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==ITS limitations==

ITS does not have a solution to all XML internationalization and localization issues.

One reason is that version 1.0 does not have data categories for everything. For example, there is currently no way to indicate a relation source/target in bilingual files where some parts of a document store the source text and some other parts the corresponding translation.

The other reason is that many aspects of internationalization cannot be resolved with a markup. They have to do with the design of the DTD or the schema itself. There are [http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/ best practices, design and authoring guidelines] that are necessary to follow to make sure documents are correctly internationalized and easy to localize. For example, using attributes to store translatable text is a bad idea for many different reasons, but ITS cannot prevent an XML developer from making such choice.

Some of the ITS 1.0 limitations are being addressed in the version 2.0: See http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/ for more details.

'''Investment-specific technological progress''' refers to progress that requires investment in new equipment and structures embodying the latest technology in order to realize its benefits.

==Introduction==
To model how something is [[Production theory basics|produced]], think of a box that in one end takes in inputs such as [[Labour (economics)|labor]] (employees) and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (equipment, buildings, etc.) and in another end spits out the [[final good]]. With this picture in mind now one can ask, how does technological progress affect production? One way of thinking is that technological progress affects ''specific'' inputs (arrows going in) such as equipment and buildings. To realize the benefits of such [[technological change]] for production, these inputs must be purchased. So for example, the advent of the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] (an important technological improvement in computers) will affect the production of [[Ford]] cars only if Ford Motor Co.'s assembly plants (the red box) invest in [[computers]] with microchips (instead of computers with [[punched cards]]) and use them (they are one of the arrows going in the box) in the production of [[Ford Mustang|Mustangs]] (the arrow coming out). As the name suggests, this is ''investment-specific'' technological progress---it requires investing in new [[machines]] or buildings which contain or ''embody'' the latest technology. Notice that the term ''investment'' can be general: not only must a [[business|firm]] buy the new technology to reap its benefits, but it also must invest in training its workers and [[management|managers]] to be able to use this new technology (Greenwood &amp; Jovanovic 2001) .

==Importance==
Identifying ''investment-specific'' technological progress is important, because knowing what type of technological progress is operating in an [[economy]] will determine how someone (should) want his or her [[tax]] dollars to be spent and how he or she may want to invest his or her [[savings]] (Gort et al. 1999). If "investment-specific" technological change is the main source of progress, then one would want his or her dollars spent on helping firms buy new equipment and renovate their plants, because these investments will improve production and hence what you consume. Furthermore, one may want to help pay for current employee training in using new technologies (to keep them up to date) or subsidize the education of new employees (who will enter the job market knowing how to use the new technology). So, the type of technological progress will also matter for unemployment and education issues. Finally, if technological progress is "investment-specific" you may want to direct your money towards the research and development (R &amp; D) of new technologies (like quantum computers or alternative energy sources) (Krusell 1998).

More generally, why is any type of technological progress important? Technological change has made our lives easier. Because of technological progress, people can work less, make more money and enjoy more leisure time (Greenwood &amp; Vandenbroucke 2006). Women have been able to break away from the traditional "[[housewife]]" role, join the labor-force in greater numbers (Greenwood et al. 2005) and become less economically dependent on men (Greenwood &amp; Guner 2009). Finally, technological progress has been shown to affect the fall in [[child labor]] starting around 1900 (Greenwood &amp; Seshadri 2005). Figure 1 illustrates this last point: in 1900 child labor's share of the paid labor force began to fall.

[[Image:kid1.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 1]]

==A simple example: the microwave oven==
An example of investment-specific technological progress is the [[microwave oven]]. The idea of the microwave came to be by accident: in 1946 an engineer noticed that a [[candy bar]] in his pocket had melted while working on something completely unrelated to cooking (Gallawa 2005). The development of this good, from melting the candy bar to the home appliance we know today, took time and the investment of resources to make a microwave small and cheap. The first microwave oven cost between 2000 and 3000 dollars and was housed in refrigerator-sized cabinets (Gallawa 2005)! Today, almost any college student can enjoy a 3-minute microwaveable meal in the smallest dorm room. But a microwave's uses do not stop at the dorm room. Many industries have found microwave heating advantageous: it has been used to dry cork, ceramics, paper, leather, and so on (Gallawa 2005). However, for either college students or firms to reap the benefits of quick warming, they must first "invest" in a microwave oven (that "embodies" the technological advance). To realize the benefits of investment-specific technological progress you must first invest in a technology that embodies it.

==Measurement==
While measuring technological progress is not easy, economists have found indirect ways of estimating it. If "'investment-specific'" technological progress makes producing goods easier, then the price of the goods affected (relative to the price of other goods) should decrease. In particular, "investment-specific" technological advance has affected the prices of two inputs into the production process: equipment and structures. Think of equipment as machines (like computers) and structures as buildings. If there is technological progress in the production (or creation) of these goods, then one would expect the price of them to fall or the value of them to rise relative to older versions of the same good.

Figure 2 (the pink line) shows how the price of new producer durables (such as equipment) in the US relative to the price of new consumer nondurables (like clothing) has consistently declined over the past fifty years (Gort et al. 1999). To calculate the relative price of producer durables divide the price that firms pay (for the durable inputs of production) by the price that a regular consumer pays (for things like [[jeans]]). We use relative prices so we can say how many units of equipment can be bought instead (or in terms) of buying one unit of consumer goods. Figure 3 (the pink line) says that over time, firms have been able to buy more and more units of equipment instead of one unit of consumption, especially when we take into account that the quality of equipment being acquired has increased (a computer today is much faster than a computer five years ago and we should take that into account when comparing their prices). When changes in quality are not taken into account (which is wrong) it looks like the price of equipment has not decreased as much (see the black line in Figure 2).

[[File:Investment-specific technological progress - Figure 2.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 2]]

Measuring the price of structures is more complicated than measuring the price of equipment, but economists have again been able to get an idea of how much progress there has been in structures (such as buildings). One approach is that if newer buildings were constructed or designed using newer technologies then they should be worth more than older buildings (because they '''embody''' the new technology (Gort et al. 1999). In particular, they should rent for more. As Figure 3 shows, this is true. Renting a square foot in a new building is much more expensive than renting a square foot in a building forty years old. So it must be the case that you are paying for a nicer, more functional and maybe even safer building.

[[Image:figure4.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 3]]
Figures 2 and 3 suggest that '''investment-specific''' technological change is operating in the US. The annual rate of technological progress in equipment and structures has been estimated to be about 3.2% and 1%, respectively (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997).

==Conclusion==
In the second section it was mentioned that "investment-specific" technological change is important since it will affect production (both in quality and size). An important question then is, just how much "bang for your buck" do you get with "investment-specific" technological change? The answer is quite astounding; economists have found that 37% of growth in US output (production) is due to technological progress in equipment and 15% is due to technological progress in structures (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997). All in all, more than half (37% + 15% = 52%) of the growth of the US economy is due to "investment-specific" technological change (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997).

The '''MTV-1 Micro TV''' was the second model of a [[handheld television|near pocket-sized]] [[television]]. The first was the Panasonic IC model TR-001 introduced in 1970. The MTV-1 was developed by [[Clive Sinclair]] (Sinclair Radionics Ltd). It was shown to the public at [[trade show]]s in [[London]] and [[Chicago]] in January, 1977, and released for sale in 1978. Development spanned 10 years and included a cash infusion of {{GBP|1.6 million|link=yes}} (about {{USD|2.9 million}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) from the UK government in 1976.

The MTV-1 used a [[Germany|German]] [[Telefunken|AEG Telefunken]] {{convert|2|inch|cm|adj=on}} black-and-white, electrostatic [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), the smallest CRT built into a commercially available product, and included a rechargeable 4-[[AA battery|AA]]-cell [[NiCad]] battery pack. It measured {{convert|4|*|6.25|*|1.625|in|mm}} and weighed {{convert|28|oz|g}}. It was able to receive either [[phase alternating line|PAL]] or [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] transmissions on [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]]. A [[Wales|Welsh]] company, Wolsey Electronics, manufactured it for Sinclair. Custom [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]] and Sinclair contributed to its small size and low power consumption.

The original {{USD|395}} (about {{GBP|205}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) price tag proved to be too high to sell many of them, and Sinclair lost over {{GBP|1.8 million}} in 1978, eventually selling its remaining inventory to liquidators at greatly reduced prices.

The MTV-1B, released later in 1978 at the much lower price of {{GBP|99}}, was able to receive only British and South African UHF PAL signals.

[[File:Unix manual.png|thumb|The man page on {{tt|man(1)}}, as seen in various [[Linux distribution]]s. This version of the utility predates Linux itself, but is now maintained by the [[Debian]] project.|330x330px]]

A '''man page''' (short for '''manual page''') is a form of [[software documentation]] usually found on a [[Unix]] or [[Unix-like]] [[Operating System|operating system]]. Topics covered include [[computer program]]s (including [[library (computing)|library]] and [[system call]]s), formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. A [[User (computing)|user]] may invoke a man page by issuing the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; [[Command (computing)|command]].

By default, &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; typically uses a [[terminal pager]] program such as &lt;code&gt;[[more (command)|more]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[[less (Unix)|less]]&lt;/code&gt; to display its output.

==History==
[[File:Screenshot of "Xman" program.png|thumb|''xman'', an early [[X11]] application for viewing manual pages]]
[[File:OpenBSD Manpages Section 8 Intro.png|thumb|[[OpenBSD]] section 8 intro manpage, displaying in a text console]]

In the first two years of the [[history of Unix]], no documentation existed.&lt;ref name="reader"&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[http://man.cat-v.org/unix-1st/ Unix Programmer's Manual]'' was first published on November 3, 1971. The first actual man pages were written by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] at the insistence of their manager [[Douglas McIlroy|Doug McIlroy]] in 1971. Aside from the man pages, the ''Programmer's Manual'' also accumulated a set of short papers, some of them [[tutorial]]s (e.g. for general Unix usage, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language, and tools such as [[Yacc]]), and others more detailed descriptions of operating system features. The printed version of the manual initially fit into a single binder, but as of [[PWB/UNIX]] and the [[Version 7 Unix|7th Edition]] of [[Research Unix]], it was split into two volumes with the printed man pages forming Volume 1.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/history.html |title=UNIX Evolution: 1975-1984 Part I - Diversity |last1=Darwin |first1=Ian  |last2=Collyer |first2=Geoffrey |accessdate=22 December 2012}} Originally published in ''Microsystems'' '''5'''(11), November 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later versions of the documentation imitated the first man pages' terseness. Ritchie added a "How to get started" section to the [[Version 3 Unix|Third Edition]] introduction, and [[Lorinda Cherry]] provided the "Purple Card" pocket reference for the [[Version 6 Unix|Sixth]] and [[Version 7 Unix|Seventh]] Editions.{{r|reader}} Versions of the software were named after the revision of the manual; the seventh edition of the ''Unix Programmer's Manual'', for example, came with the 7th Edition or Version 7 of Unix.&lt;ref name="fiedler198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Version 4 Unix|Fourth]] Edition the man pages were formatted using the [[troff]] typesetting package{{r|reader}} and its set of &lt;code&gt;-man&lt;/code&gt; macros (which were completely revised between the Sixth and Seventh Editions of the ''Manual'',&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; but have since not drastically changed). At the time, the availability of online documentation through the manual page system was regarded as a great advance. To this day, virtually every Unix command line application comes with a man page, and many Unix users perceive a program's lack of man pages as a sign of low quality; indeed, some projects, such as [[Debian]], go out of their way to write man pages for programs lacking one. The modern descendants of [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD]] also distribute man pages as one of the primary forms of system documentation (having replaced the old &lt;code&gt;-man&lt;/code&gt; macros with the newer &lt;code&gt;-mdoc&lt;/code&gt;).

Few alternatives to &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; have enjoyed much popularity, with the possible exception of [[GNU Project|GNU Project's]] "&lt;code&gt;[[Texinfo|info]]&lt;/code&gt;" system, an early and simple [[hypertext]] system.
In addition, some Unix [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] applications (particularly those built using the [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] development environments) now provide end-user documentation in [[HTML]] and include embedded HTML viewers such as &lt;code&gt;yelp&lt;/code&gt; for reading the help within the application.

Man pages are usually written in English, but translations into other languages may be available on the system.

[[File:FreeBSD typeset man page.png|thumb|Part of the [[FreeBSD]] {{tt|man(1)}} manual page, typeset into [[portable document format|PDF]] format.]]
The default format of the man pages is [[troff]], with either the [[troff macros|macro package]] man (appearance oriented) or [[mdoc]] (semantic oriented). This makes it possible to typeset a man page into [[PostScript]], [[portable document format|PDF]], and various other formats for viewing or printing.

Most [[Unix]] systems have a package for the man2html command, which enables users to browse their man pages using an html browser (textproc/man2html on [[FreeBSD]] or ''man'' on some [[Linux]] distribution).

In 2010, [[OpenBSD]] deprecated [[troff]] for formatting manpages in favour of [[mandoc]], a specialised compiler/formatter for manpages with native support for output in [[PostScript]], [[HTML]], [[XHTML]], and the terminal.

In February 2013, the [[BSD]] community saw a new open source [http://mdoc.su/ mdoc.su] service launched, which unified and shortened access to the man.cgi scripts of the major modern BSD projects through a unique [[nginx]]-based deterministic [[URL shortening]] service for the *BSD man pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/news/status/report-2013-01-2013-03.html#mdoc.su-%E2%80%94-Short-Manual-Page-URLs &lt;!--|archive-url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2013-May/001475.html--&gt; |title=FreeBSD Quarterly Status Report, January-March 2013 |publisher=[[FreeBSD]] |editor-first=Gabor |editor-last=Pali |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |date=19 February 2013 |url=http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-doc/2013-February/021465.html |mailinglist=freebsd-doc@freebsd.org |title=announcing mdoc.su, short manual page URLs |first=Constantine A. |last=Murenin |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdoc.su/ |title=mdoc.su — Short manual page URLs for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly BSD |first=Constantine A. |last=Murenin |date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in the man-db version of the man command that would cause the command to return "gimme gimme gimme" when run at 00:30 (a reference to the [[ABBA]] song [[Gimme!

== Command usage ==
To read a manual page for a Unix command, a user can type:

&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man &lt;command_name&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Pages are traditionally referred to using the notation "name(section)": for example, {{man|1|ftp|FreeBSD||inline}}. The section refers to different ways the topic might be referenced - for example, as a system call, or a shell (command line) command or package, or a package's configuration file, or as a coding construct / header.

The same page name may appear in more than one section of the manual, such as when the names of [[system call]]s, user [[Command (computing)|command]]s, or [[Troff macro|macro packages]] coincide. Examples are {{man|1|man|ManKier||inline}} and {{man|7|man|ManKier||inline}}, or {{man|2|exit|Linux||inline}} and {{man|3|exit|Linux||inline}}. The syntax for accessing the non-default manual section varies between different man implementations. 

On Solaris and illumos, for example, the syntax for reading {{man|3c|printf|Solaris||inline}} is:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man -s 3c printf
&lt;/source&gt;
On Linux and BSD derivatives the same invocation would be:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
man 3 printf
&lt;/source&gt;

which searches for ''[[printf]]'' in section 3 of the man pages.

== Manual sections ==
{{unref|section|date=November 2018}}
The manual is generally split into eight numbered sections, organized as follows (on [[Research Unix]], [[BSD]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]):

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|1
|General [[Command (computing)|command]]s
|-
|2
|[[System call]]s
|-
|3
|[[library (computing)|Library]] functions, covering in particular the [[C standard library]]
|-
|4
|[[Special file]]s (usually devices, those found in /dev) and [[device driver|drivers]]
|-
|5
|[[File format]]s and conventions
|-
|6
|[[Video game|Game]]s and [[screensaver]]s
|-
|7
|Miscellanea
|-
|8
|System administration [[command (computing)|command]]s and [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s
|}

Unix [[System V]] uses a similar numbering scheme, except in a different order:

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|1
|General [[Command (computing)|command]]s
|-
|1M
|System administration [[command (computing)|command]]s and [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s
|-
|2
|[[System call]]s
|-
|3
|[[C library]] functions
|-
|4
|[[File format]]s and conventions
|-
|5
|Miscellanea
|-
|6
|[[Video game|Game]]s and [[screensaver]]s
|-
|7
|[[Special file]]s (usually devices, those found in /dev) and [[device driver|drivers]]
|-
|}

On some systems some of the following sections are available:

{| class="wikitable"
!Section
!Description
|-
|0
|[[C library]] [[header file]]s
|-
|9
|[[Kernel (computing)|Kernel]] routines
|-
|n
|[[Tcl]]/[[Tk (computing)|Tk]] keywords
|-
|x
|The [[X Window System]]
|}

Some sections are further subdivided by means of a suffix; for example, in some systems, section 3C is for C library calls, 3M is for the math library, and so on. A consequence of this is that section 8 (system administration commands) is sometimes relegated to the 1M subsection of the main commands section.  Some subsection suffixes have a general meaning across sections:
{| class="wikitable"
!Subsection
!Description
|-
|p || [[POSIX]] specifications
|-
|x || [[X Window System]] documentation
|}

Some versions of &lt;tt&gt;man&lt;/tt&gt; cache the formatted versions of the last several pages viewed.

== Layout ==
All man pages follow a common layout that is optimized for presentation on a simple [[ASCII]] text display, possibly without any form of highlighting or font control. Sections present may include: 

; NAME: The name of the command or function, followed by a one-line description of what it does.
; SYNOPSIS: In the case of a command, a formal description of how to run it and what command line options it takes.  For program functions, a list of the parameters the function takes and which header file contains its definition.
; DESCRIPTION: A textual description of the functioning of the command or function.
; EXAMPLES: Some examples of common usage.
; SEE ALSO: A list of related commands or functions.

Other sections may be present, but these are not well standardized across man pages.  Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY and COPYRIGHT.

{{more footnotes|date=October 2008}}

The '''Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard''' ('''METS''') is a [[metadata standards|metadata standard]] for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using the [[XML]] schema language of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). The standard is maintained as part of the [[MARC standards]] of the [[Library of Congress]], and is being developed as an initiative of the [[Digital Library Federation]] (DLF).

==Overview==
METS is an XML Schema designed for the purpose of:
* Creating XML document instances that express the hierarchical structure of [[digital library]] objects.
* Recording the names and locations of the files that comprise those objects.
* Recording associated [[metadata]]. METS can, therefore, be used as a tool for modeling real world objects, such as particular document types.

Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of [[Submission Information Package]] (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System ([[OAIS]]) Reference Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems|title=Space Data and Information Transfer System -- Open Archival Information System -- Reference Model (ISO 14721:2012)|date=2012|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|location=Geneva|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries vs traditional libraries===
Maintaining a library of digital objects requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. METS is intended to promote the preservation of, and interoperability between digital libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu. PDF p. 1, 20-21. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Where a '''traditional [[library]]''' may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note, for example, that the book was produced using a [[Ryobi offset press]].
* The same cannot be said for a '''digital library'''. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. 
* However, in a digital library it is possible to create an eBook-like PDF file or TIFF file which can be seen as a single physical book and reflect the integrity of the original.

===Flexibility and interoperability===
The open flexibility of METS means that there is not a prescribed vocabulary which allows many different types of institutions, with many different document types, to utilize METS. The customization of METS makes it highly functional internally, but creates limitations for interoperability. Interoperability becomes difficult when the exporting and importing institutions have used vocabularies. As a workaround for this problem the creation of institutional profiles has become popular. These profiles document the implementation of METS specific to that institution helping to map content in order for exchanged METS documents to be more usable across institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=J.|author2=Pearson, D. |author3=Williams, M. |author4=Yeadon, S. |title=The Australian METS Profile – A journey about metadata.|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=2008|volume=14|issue=3/4|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march08/pearce/03pearce.html|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Lindsey|title=METS: A Survey of Recent Literature and Applications|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice|date=2011|volume=2011|series=ISSN 1522-0222|url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mbolin/wagner.htm|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
As early as 1996 the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began working toward the development of a system that combined encoding for an outline of a digital object's structure with metadata for that object. In 1998 this work was expanded upon by the Making of America II project (MoAII). An important objective of this project was the creation of a standard for digital objects that would include defined metadata for the descriptive, administrative, and structural aspects of a digital object. A type of structural and metadata encoding system using an XML [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) was the result of these efforts. The MoAII DTD was limited in that it did not provide flexibility in which metadata terms could be used for the elements in the descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata portions of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu. PDF p. 2. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a new version of the DTD was developed that used [[namespaces]] separate from the system rather than the vocabulary of the previous DTD. This revision was the foundation for the current METS schema, officially named in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, M. V. (2004).

==Characteristics==
[[File:PARTSangles.jpg |thumb|upright=1.1 |Sections of a METS document]]
Any METS document has the following features:
* An open standard (non-proprietary)
* Developed by the library community
* Relatively simple
* Extensible
* Modular

==The 7 sections of a METS document==
* '''METS header''' metsHdr: the METS document itself, such as its creator, editor, etc.
* '''Descriptive Metadata''' dmdSec: May contain internally embedded metadata or point to metadata external to the METS document. Multiple instances of both internal and external descriptive metadata may be included.
* '''Administrative Metadata''' amdSec: Provides information regarding how files were created and stored, intellectual property rights, metadata regarding the original source object from which the digital library object derives, and information regarding the provenance of files comprising the digital library object (such as master/derivative relationships, migrations, and transformations). As with descriptive metadata, administrative metadata may be internally encoded or external to the METS document.
* '''File Section''' fileSec: Lists all files containing content which comprise the electronic versions of the digital object. &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt; elements may be grouped within &lt;tt&gt;fileGrp&lt;/tt&gt; elements to subdivide files by object version. Although this section is not required, it is typically included in most METS documents as it adds a level of functionality to the structure of the document.
* '''Structural Map''' structMap: Outlines a hierarchical structure for the digital library object, and links the elements of that structure to associated content files and metadata. The Structural Map is the only section required for all METS documents.
* '''Structural Links''' structLink: Allows METS creators to record the existence of hyperlinks between nodes in the Structural Map. This is of particular value in using METS to archive Websites.
* '''Behavioral''' behaviorSec: Used to associate executable behaviors with content in the METS object. Each behavior has a mechanism element identifying a module of executable code that implements behaviors defined abstractly by its interface definition.

==METS profiles==
A profile is expressed as an XML document. There is a schema for this purpose. The profile expresses the requirements that a METS document must satisfy.
A sufficiently explicit METS Profile may be considered a ''data standard''.

===METS profiles in use===
* Musical Score (may be a score, score and parts, or a set of parts only)
* Print Material (books, pamphlets, etc.)
* Music Manuscript (score or sketches)
* Recorded Event (audio or video)
* [[PDF]] Document
* Bibliographic Record
* Photograph
* Compact Disc
* Collection

The '''Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning''' ('''MSIP''', {{korean|hangul=미래창조과학부|hanja={{linktext|未來|創造|科學|部}}}}) was a ministry of the [[Government of South Korea]]. Its purpose is to set, manage, and evaluate science and technology policy, support scientific research and development, develop human resources, conduct R&amp;D leading to the production and consumption of [[Atomic power]], plan national informatization and information protection strategies, manage radio frequency bands, oversee the [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) industry, and operate [[Korea Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of government formation|url=http://law.go.kr/lsSc.do?menuId=0&amp;p1=&amp;subMenu=1&amp;nwYn=1&amp;query=%EC%A0%95%EB%B6%80%EC%A1%B0%EC%A7%81%EB%B2%95&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#liBgcolor0|publisher=Republic of Korea|accessdate=18 February 2014|language=ko|date=2013-12-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225040948/http://law.go.kr/lsSc.do?menuId=0&amp;p1=&amp;subMenu=1&amp;nwYn=1&amp;query=%EC%A0%95%EB%B6%80%EC%A1%B0%EC%A7%81%EB%B2%95&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#liBgcolor0|archivedate=25 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in Building #4 of the Gwacheon Government Complex in [[Gwacheon]], [[Gyeonggi Province]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.msip.go.kr/english/wpge/m_71/eng0506.do Location Map] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140101163720/http://english.msip.go.kr/english/wpge/m_71/eng0506.do |date=2014-01-01 }}."

[[Ministry of Science and ICT]] succeeds the ministry from 2017.

==History==

The creation of the ministry was announced in February 2013.&lt;ref name="yonhap_20130328"&gt;Chang, J.S. [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/fullstory/2013/03/28/99/4500000000AEN20130328002300315F.HTML "English names of government ministries finalized"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200345/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/fullstory/2013/03/28/99/4500000000AEN20130328002300315F.HTML |date=2014-01-02 }} ''Yonhap News'' March 28, 2013. Retrieved on June 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry was created under a reorganization plan initiated by [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Park Geun-hye]] in an effort to generate new sources of economic growth in the areas of [[science]] and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name="kitt_20130422"&gt;[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/27869/science-ict-ministry-strives-create-jobs-new-industries "Science &amp; ICT ministry strives to create jobs, new industries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218134555/http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/27869/science-ict-ministry-strives-create-jobs-new-industries |date=2014-02-18 }} ''Korea IT Times'' April 22, 2013. Retrieved on June 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the ministry was one of Park's core pledges during the 2013 campaign leading to her election.&lt;ref name="yonhap_20130317"&gt;Shim, S. [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/03/17/42/0301000000AEN20130317003451315F.HTML "(2nd LD) Rival parties reach agreement on gov't restructuring plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222212843/http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/03/17/42/0301000000AEN20130317003451315F.HTML |date=2014-02-22 }} "Yonhap News" March 17, 2013. Retrieved on June 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry dissolved in July, 2017. [[Ministry of Science and ICT]] (과학기술정보통신부) succeeds the former ministry.

==Leadership==

Choi Mun-kee was the inaugural Minister of this Ministry. Later [[Choi Yanghee]] became the Minister of Science, ICT and Future Planning.&lt;ref name="koreatimes_20130401"&gt;Jun Ji-hye.

==Mandate &amp; activities==

Policies on new media, such as cable TV service operators, satellite channels and [[digital multimedia broadcasting]] , have been transferred to this ministry.&lt;ref name="yonhap_20130317" /&gt; The ministry is expected to contribute to the creation of about 410,000 jobs in these areas by the year 2017, including about 90,000 jobs in business start-ups.&lt;ref name="kitt_20130422" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg_20130531" /&gt;

The ministry will help drive the so-called national informatization project, which seeks to introduce technology into a variety of areas including traditional markets, agriculture, and small- and medium-sized businesses.&lt;ref name="kitt_20130422" /&gt;

===Awards===

The ministry is responsible for awarding the Korea Science and Technology Award in conjunction with the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies&lt;ref name="koreatimes_20130625"&gt;Kwon, Ji-youn. [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2013/06/178_138085.html "SNU professors win national science award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221183542/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2013/06/178_138085.html |date=2014-02-21 }} ''Korea Times'' June 25, 2013. Retrieved on June 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Korea Mobile App Award in conjunction with the MoneyToday publication.&lt;ref name="wsj_20130605" /&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Naming ===
Because the ministry not only took over from the former [[Ministry of Science and Technology (South Korea)|Ministry of Science and Technology]], but also assumed responsibility for ICT from the [[Ministry of Information and Communication (South Korea)|Ministry of Information and Communication]] and control of [[Korea Post]], some people worry that it has become bloated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Some others worry about its Korean name, as the Korean name translates directly to English as "Ministry of Future Creation and Science". Some scientists worry that it hints at [[Creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jin|first=Um|script-title=ko:정부 부처 명칭 어찌하오리까?|url=http://news.tv.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/01/16/2013011602783.html|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=TV Chosun|date=16 January 2013|language=ko|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106163456/http://news.tv.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/01/16/2013011602783.html|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news1.kr/articles/1029053 | script-title=ko:장하나 "미래창조과학부 종교연구단체?" | date=27 February 2013 | agency=News1 | accessdate=6 January 2014 | author=Seungsup, Kim | language=ko | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106061853/http://news1.kr/articles/1029053 | archivedate=6 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity bias ===
On May 2013, a [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] was created within the ministry, stating their purpose as "Becoming lead [[gospel]] on ministry, and change country for god". According to their business plan, they planned to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] one person every month, identifying Islam as a cult organization. People worry about the religious neutrality of public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.christiantoday.co.kr/view.htm?id=263532 | script-title=ko:미래창조과학부 기독선교회 창립… 회장은 용홍택 정책관 | date=3 May 2013 | agency=Christiantoday | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Dongyun Lee | language=ko | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107033228/http://www.christiantoday.co.kr/view.htm?id=263532 | archivedate=7 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1001768328 | script-title=ko:미래창조과학부 기독선교회 창립, 종교 중립 논란 | date=3 May 2013 | agency=SBS | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Sangyeop Lee | language=ko | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107045943/http://news.sbs.co.kr/section_news/news_read.jsp?news_id=N1001768328 | archivedate=7 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person in charge said "the business plan is just a document made by a member of the mission, and is not an official policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dongascience.com/news/view/1035 | script-title=ko:미래부 특정 종교 '입김' 강해지나…이슬람교 이단 규정 | date=11 June 2013 | agency=Dong A Science | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Yongha Ryu | language=ko | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107045940/http://www.dongascience.com/news/view/1035 | archivedate=7 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mobile form ''' is an electronic or digital form application that functions on a [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer|tablet device]]. Mobile forms enable users to collect [[data]] using [[mobile device]]s, and then to send the results back to the source. Mobile forms exist to replace paper forms as a more productive means of [[data collection]], eliminating the need to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] or scan paper data results into a back office system.

Depending on the [[mobile form]] [[App (computing)|application]] provider, some mobile form solutions allow offices to dispatch data to mobile form applications. In addition, other mobile form applications can be connected with various [[cloud service]]s, [[Server (computing)|servers]], and [[social media platform]]s.

Depending on the business, the motivating factors to deploying mobile forms may vary. Some businesses implement mobile forms to speed up processes, while others institute mobile forms with field users to reduce [[cost]]s associated with transporting paper forms back and forth. Furthermore, [[Green business|green-minded businesses]] implement mobile forms in order to be more environmentally friendly, thus reducing their reliance on paper, ink printing, and subsequent waste.

Advanced mobile form features include [[signature]] capture, [[bar code]] capture, photo capture, [[GPS]] location form info, time form info, and skip logic.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Uses for mobile forms include:
* [[Safety inspection]]s 
* [[Work order]]s
* [[Expense report]]s
* [[Inventory]] reports
* [[Merchandise]] requisition
* [[Invoice|Invoicing]]

'''Mobile technology in Africa''' is a fastest growing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aiti.mit.edu/|title=MIT Global Startup Labs|website=aiti.mit.edu|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowhere is the effect more dramatic than in Africa, where mobile technology often represents the first modern infrastructure of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_39/b4051054.htm|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.businessweek.com|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 10% of Internet users are in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm|title=Africa Internet Users, 2018 Population and Facebook Statistics|website=www.internetworldstats.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 50% of Africans have mobile phones and their penetration is expanding rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.budde.com.au/Research/2010-Global-Mobile-Communications-Key-Trends-and-Growth-in-a-Challenging-Environment.html|title=2010 Global Mobile Communications - Key Trends and Growth in a Challenging Environment - BuddeComm|website=www.budde.com.au|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that mobile technology is the largest platform in Africa, and can access a wide range of income groups. AppsAfrica reports Mobile App downloads will reach 98 billion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appsafrica.com/1/post/2012/01/apps-revolution-game-changer-for-mobile-operators-in-africa.html/ Mobile App downloads will reach 98 billion]&lt;/ref&gt; which will have a huge benefit for mobile app developers in Africa [http://www.appsafrica.com/1/post/2012/01/apps-revolution-game-changer-for-mobile-operators-in-africa.html]

As a consequence of the wider availability of mobile telephony with respect to fixed telephony, in many African countries most [[Internet]] traffic goes through the mobile network. An example is [[Seychelles]], that is the African country with a larger percentage of Internet subscribers, where most Internet users access the net through the mobile network.&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt;

==Growth of mobile telephony in the 2000s==
Several factors contributed to the "boom" of mobile telephony in Africa in the 2000s.

===Limitations of African PSTNs===
[[Image:Public telephone uganda.jpg|thumb|right|An [[MTN Group|MTN]]-operated "mobile phone booth" ([[Uganda]] 2009)]]
A major success factor of mobile telephony in Africa is the scarce diffusion of [[PSTN]]s (fixed line networks). In 2000, [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] as a whole had fewer telephone lines than [[Manhattan]] alone. Fixed line networks hardly reach the remote rural areas where a relevant percentage of the African population lives. Of about 400.000 rural settlements that are estimated to exist in Africa, less than 3% have [[PSTN]] access. Mobile telephony providers have taken advantage of this situation, implementing a very aggressive diffusion strategy for mobile networks. In 2006, 45% of rural settlements in Africa had [[GSM]] coverage. More recently, coverage has reached 90% of the territory in several countries, including [[Comoros]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mauritius]], [[Seychelles]], [[South Africa]], and [[Uganda]]. Other countries that in 2007 reached above 50% of GSM coverage are [[Botswana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Burundi]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea]], [[Namibia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Togo]].&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt; As a consequence of the larger diffusion of GSM networks over fixed line networks, "mobile-telephone booths" are common in some areas of Africa.

The fixed line market in Africa is generally based on [[monopoly]] (often [[state monopoly]]), with a few number of [[incumbent operator]]s who did not invest in spreading their networks much farther than the larger urban areas. While this situation is changing (for example, both [[Telecom Kenya]] and [[Botswana Telecommunications Corporation]] have recently been privatized, and a market [[liberalization]] strategy has been initiated in several countries&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt;), the mobile telephony market is generally more competitive and dynamic.&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt;

The table below outlines the percentage of African countries where [[telecommunications]] markets (fixed line telephony, mobile telephony, [[Internet]]) are fully competitive, partially competitive, or monopolistic, either ''de iure'' or ''de facto'' (data refer to 2007).&lt;ref name="ITU"&gt;See ITU (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market strategies===
[[Image:Village antenna.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[GSM]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] in a rural village ([[Gambia]])]] 
Mobile telephony providers that introduced mobile telephony in Africa in the 2000s adopted [[business model]]s explicitly designed to reach the poorest (and largest) section of the population, with low-priced [[mobile phone]]s and small denomination [[Prepaid debit card|prepaid card]]s.&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt;

Another key success factor in the providers' strategy in Africa has been the cutting down of [[roaming]] costs. This is especially relevant in Africa since strong relationships often hold between neighbouring communities that happen to be separated by national borders.&lt;ref name="ITU"/&gt; [[Celtel]] was the first operator to provide free roaming with the 2006 [[One Network]] campaign, whereby roaming became free between [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]]. In 2007 this has been extended to [[Gabon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Malawi]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;See Reuters (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; After Celtel, other providers operating in African markets have announced their intent to gradually reduce and eventually abolish roaming costs for certain areas.

==Non-profit mobile technology==
Mobile technology can be used, not only to generate profit from high income groups, but to provide information and create social change for low income groups. For example, mobile technology is used to provide information on health, education, finances or to access specific groups such as the youth. 
However, people who are very poor have very basic phones. Thus non-profit mobile technology is not aimed at advanced smart phones, but ranges from sending out bulk [[SMS]]s to [[USSD]], mobi-sites and mobile communities. AppsAfrica&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appsafrica.com/1/post/2012/02/developing-rural-areas-will-provide-next-billion-phone-users.html / details the next 1 Billion phone users will come from Rural areas]&lt;/ref&gt; writes the next 1 Billion phone users will come from Rural areas [http://www.appsafrica.com/1/post/2012/02/developing-rural-areas-will-provide-next-billion-phone-users.html]

The ultimate aim of non-profit mobile technology is to make it fat, or as near to free for the end user. This means enlisting donors and getting mobile networks on board. Internationally, companies such as TextToChange, [[FrontlineSMS]], [[RapidSMS]], [[Ushahidi]] all work with mobiles in health, disaster relief and aid management.

==Promote health==
[[mHealth]] is using mobile technology to provide groups with health information. It was pioneered in part by the [[United Nations Foundation|UN Foundation]] and [[Vodafone#Vodafone Foundation|Vodafone Foundation]] through partnerships with the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] and the social enterprise [[Magpi|DataDyne]], who then joined with other partners in forging the mHealth Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfoundation.org/our-solutions/mobile-technology/tech4dev/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
mHealth activities come in the form of appointment reminders, community mobilization and health promotion, emergency toll-free telephone services, health call centres, health surveys, information initiatives and patient monitoring among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhealthalliance.org/news/mobile-health-activity-spreads-over-4-5-countries-remains-limited-small-scale-and-single-issue-|title=Welcome to mHealth Knowledge {{!}} www.mhealthknowledge.org|website=www.mhealthalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the first African mobile health summit was held in [[Cape Town]]. At the summit, the WHO released a report stating that eighty-three per cent of governments surveyed had at least one mHealth project in their country. However, the majority of mHealth activities were limited in size and scope.
mHealth initiatives were health call centres (59%), emergency toll-free telephone services (55%), managing emergencies and disasters (54%), and mobile telemedicine (49%).

In South Africa, companies like Cell-Life and GeoMed and HealthSMS use mobile technology for health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/global-health/mobile-health-for-development.html|title=Mobile Health for Development|website=United Nations Foundation|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fight HIV/Aids==
The [[Praekelt Foundation]] is a South African example of a [[non profit organisation]] that is using mobile technology to create social change. Their programmes have currently reached 50 million people across 15 countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Praekelt Foundation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.praekelt.org/|title=Home|website=Praekelt.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders saw that the technology they were creating for corporate clients could be useful for NGOs to provide information to their target markets. “Full profit want to reach people for different reasons, but people should not be charged for having access to life saving information,” says Marcha Neethling, head of operations at Praekelt Foundation.

One of the mobile technologies developed by Praekelt Foundation is a mobile community called YoungAfricaLive (YAL). Users do not need to have airtime or data bundles on their phones to use it. The aim of the mobile community was to create a space that would be interactive and fun where young people could talk candidly and learn about love, relationships and sex and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Praekelt Foundation"/&gt;

The mobile community is unique to the [[Vodacom]] network. At the end of 2010, Vodacom’s mobile platform, Vodafone Live, was receiving 3.2 million unique users monthly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.habarimedia.co.za/mobile/vodafone-live&lt;/ref&gt; As (young) people were already using mobile technology to surf the net and download songs etc. it seemed the perfect place to engage with this target group.

The community is aimed at users between 16 and 24 and users receive daily news and celeb stories. All with a social call to action at the end, they participate in polls, watch videos that link to stories and can engage in anonymous chat rooms. Experts come on to the chat rooms to discuss sexual topics and allow users to ask personal questions anonymously. For example, well known South African sexologist Dr Eve hosts live chats once a week.

Users have engaged with the community and many of the updated features of the community have come directly from user suggestions. Users have commented saying YoungAfricaLive creates a platform for them to express their ideas, making them proud of their status and encouraging them to be responsible around sex.

The ongoing challenge with free mobile communities and technology is continuing to engage the service provider to allow the community to be entirely free. “With YoungAfricaLive South Africa, Vodacom is sponsoring the bandwidth, which is a massive investment. .. (thus) sustainability is always a question.”&lt;ref&gt;South African sexologist Dr Eve&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community crime fighting==
In 2011 [[Vodacom]] pioneered a project in South Africa to fight crime using mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vodacom.com/news_article.php?articleID=958&amp;pid=press_releases&lt;/ref&gt; They partnered with The Khulisa's Youth out of School Ubuntu Club in Tembisa, Johannesburg and donated a computer and seven mobile phones to the Club. These are used by the young patrollers in the community to keep in touch and to report all crime incidents, as well as update the community on current events.

The project is based in the Phomolong area of Tembisa, which is notorious for high levels of criminal activity. Each mobile phone donated has internet capabilities  and the members of the Club will be allocated a mobile phone that they will use to capture events, interview members of the community and create video clips. These will be uploaded to their [[Facebook]] page and website all in an effort to report on criminal activity in the community.

The [[South African Police Service]] also runs a national crime line which they encourage citizens to SMS in and report crimes in their communities.

'''Operation Serenata de Amor''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] project to analyze public spending in Brazil. The project has been funded by a recurrent financing campaign since [[Independence Day (Brazil)|September 7]], 2016, and came in the wake of major scandals of misappropriation of public funds in Brazil, such as the [[Mensalão scandal]] and what was revealed in the [[Operation Car Wash]] investigations. 

The analysis began with data from the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] and then expanded to other types of budget and other instances of government, such as the [[Federal Senate]]. The project is built through collaboration on [[GitHub]] and using a public group with more than 600 participants on [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]].

The name "Serenata de Amor," which means "serenade of love," was taken from a popular cashew cream bonbon produced by [[Garoto|Chocolates Garoto]] in Brazil.

==Modules==
Throughout the development of the project new modules have been developed in addition to the main repository:
* The [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor/ main repository, serenata-de-amor], serves as the starting point for investigative work.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie Rosie] is the robot programmed to identify public funds expenses with discrepancies, starting with CEAP (Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity); it analyzes each of the reimbursements requested by the deputies and senators, indicating the reasons that lead it to believe they are suspicious.
* From Rosie was born [https://github.com/okfn-brasil/whistleblower whistleblower], which tweets under the name of @RosieDaSerenata, distributing the results found on social media.
* [https://jarbas.serenatadeamor.org/ Jarbas] ([https://github.com/okfn-brasil/jarbas Github repository]) is a data visualization tool which shows a complete list of reimbursements made available by the Chamber of Deputies and mined by Rosie.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-toolbox Toolbox] is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] installable package to support the development of Serenata de Amor and Rosie.

==History==
Operation Serenata de Amor is an artificial intelligence project for the analysis of public expenditures. It was conceived in March 2016 by data scientist Irio Musskopf, sociologist Eduardo Cuducos and entrepreneur Felipe Cabral. The project was financed collectively in the Catarse platform, where it reached 131% of the collection goal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catarse.me/serenata|title=Operação Serenata de Amor|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Catarse}}&lt;/ref&gt; paying 3 months of project development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1852180-jovens-criam-robo-que-monitora-despesas-de-deputados-federais.shtml Jovens criam robô que monitora despesas de deputados federais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/sistema-que-fiscaliza-gastos-de-deputados-gera-680-denuncias-na-camara.ghtml Sistema que fiscaliza gastos de deputados gera 680 denúncias na Câmara]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/113732-jovens-criaram-bot-capaz-monitorar-despesas-deputados-federais.htm Jovens criaram bot capaz de monitorar despesas de deputados federais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correiodobrasil.com.br/robo-com-nome-de-bombom-promete-recuperar-r-1-bilhao-por-mes-da-corrupcao/ Robô com nome de bombom promete recuperar R$ 1 bilhão por mês da corrupção]&lt;/ref&gt; Ana Schwendler, also a data scientist; Pedro Vilanova "Tonny", data journalist; Bruno Pazzim, software engineer; Filipe Linhares, a frontend engineer, Leandro Devegili, an entrepreneur and André Pinho took the first steps towards constructing the platform, such as collecting and structuring the first datasets.

Jessica Temporal, data scientist and [[Yasodara Córdova]] "Yaso", researcher; Tatiana Balachova "Russa", UX designer; joined the project after the financing took place.

The members created a [https://apoia.se/serenata recurring financing campaign], expanding the analysis of public spending to the Federal Senate. Donors make monthly payments ranging from 5 BRL to 200 BRL to maintain group activities. The monthly amount collected is around 10,000 BRL.

==Results==
In January 2017, concluding the period financed by the initial campaign, the group carried out an investigation into the suspicious activities found by the data analysis system. 629 complaints were made to the Ombudsman's Office of the Chamber of Deputies, questioning expenses of 216 federal deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Facebook project page has more than 25,000 followers, and users frequently cite the operation as a benchmark in transparency in the Brazilian government. One of the examples of results obtained by the operation is the case of the Deputy who had to return about 700 BRL to the House &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Após ser flagrado por app, deputado devolve à Câmara R$ 727 por 13 refeições no mesmo dia|url=https://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/apos-ser-flagrado-por-app-deputado-devolve-a-camara-r-727-por-13-refeicoes-no-mesmo-dia.ghtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his expenses were analyzed by the platform.

The platform was able to analyze more than 3 million notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Programa analisa 3 milhões de notas fiscais de deputados em busca de gasto irregular|journal=G1|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/grupo-analisa-3-milhoes-de-notas-fiscais-de-deputados-em-busca-de-gastos-irregulares.ghtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising about 8,000 suspected cases in public spending. The community that supports the work of the team benefits from open source repositories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grupo prepara ‘robô’ para analisar gastos de parlamentares|url=https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2016/09/09/Grupo-prepara-%E2%80%98rob%C3%B4%E2%80%99-para-analisar-gastos-de-parlamentares|journal=Nexo Jornal}}&lt;/ref&gt; with licenses open for the collaboration.

It was also presented in the Google News Lab in 2017. It was presented by [[Yasodara Córdova|Yaso]], when she was the Director of the iniciative, at the [https://www.media.mit.edu MIT Media Lab]/[[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Klein Center]] Initiative for Artificial Intelligence ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/ai|title=Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence {{!}} Berkman Klein Center|access-date=2017-11-03|work=cyber.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [https://blogs.harvard.edu/aiandinclusionsymposium/ Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion Symposium], an iniciative of the  [https://networkofcenters.net Global Network of Internet &amp; Society Centers (NoC).] It was also presented both by Irio and Yaso at the [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/digitalhks/aboutus Digital Harvard Kennedy School,] over a lunch seminar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/digitalhks/blog/ai-and-open-data-lunch-and-learn-digital-hks-fellow-yaso-c%C3%B3rdova|title=Artificial Intelligence and Open Data with digital HKS Fellow, Yaso Córdova|website=projects.iq.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where the transparency of the platform and the main solutions found were discussed, so that the code and data are always available to verify its suitability.

By working to foster a global network of like-minded individuals, investors and entrepreneurs, Pakathon aims to solve problems in sectors such as education, healthcare, gender equality, energy and law.

== Introduction ==
The organization's flagship event is a weekend-long [[hackathon]] hosted in chapter cities where students and professionals develop and pitch their projects to a panel of mentors. Top-performing teams are then invited to present their ideas to a global audience where they compete for funding, mentorship, and additional support, with the aim of advancing their ideas from conception to reality. Two winning teams are then selected: one from Pakistan and another from the international host cities.

In 2015, Pakathon partnered with the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] to expand Pakathon's innovation-centred programming in up to 50 Pakistani universities.

== Impact ==
Pakathon's first winning team conceived the idea for ProCheck, a serialization system for authentic medicines in Pakistan. ProCheck allows customers and patients to verify authentic medicines using their mobile phones via text messaging. In November, 2015 ProCheck partnered with Ferozsons Labs, a leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in Pakistan, to serialize 35 million units of medicine using ProCheck's track and trace solution. As a result, more than 50,000 patients across the country will be able to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit medicines.

On July 18, 1877, [[Thomas Edison]] and his team invented the [[phonograph]]. His first successful recording and reproduction of intelligible sounds, achieved early in the following December, used a thin sheet of [[tin foil]] wrapped around a hand-cranked grooved metal cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/news-products/1877-thomas-edison-cylinder-recorder/383579|title=1877 Thomas Edison Cylinder Recorder|date=September 1, 2006|work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix Magazine]]|accessdate=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin foil was not a practical recording medium for either commercial or artistic purposes and the crude hand-cranked phonograph was only marketed as a novelty, to little or no profit. Edison moved on to developing a practical incandescent electric light and the next improvements to sound recording technology were made by others.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt;

Following seven years of research and experimentation at their [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Sound recording and phonograph development|Volta Laboratory]], [[Charles Sumner Tainter]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Chichester Bell]] introduced wax as the recording medium and engraving, rather than indenting, as the recording method. In 1887, their "[[Graphophone]]" system was being put to the test of practical use by official reporters of the US Congress, with commercial units later being produced by the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].&lt;ref name="acusd"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After this system was demonstrated to Edison's representatives, Edison quickly resumed work on the phonograph. He settled on a thicker all-wax cylinder, the surface of which could be repeatedly shaved down for reuse. Both the Graphophone and Edison's "Perfected Phonograph" were commercialized in 1888. Eventually, a patent-sharing agreement was signed and the wax-coated cardboard tubes were abandoned in favor of Edison's all-wax cylinders as an interchangeable standard format.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, S.

Beginning in 1885, prerecorded wax cylinders were marketed.{{Citation needed|reason=source originally cited does not support date indicated|date=July 2018}} These have professionally made recordings of songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickel-in-the-slot machines—the first juke boxes—installed in arcades and taverns, but within a few years private owners of phonographs were increasingly buying them for home use. Each cylinder can easily be placed on and removed from the [[mandrel]] of the machine used to play them.&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;

Cylinder machines of the late 1880s and the 1890s were usually sold with recording attachments. The ability to record as well as play back sound was an advantage of cylinder phonographs over the competition from cheaper [[gramophone record|disc record]] phonographs which began to be mass-marketed at the end of the 1890s, as the disc system machines can be used only to play back prerecorded sound.&lt;ref name="Gracyk" /&gt;

In the earliest stages of phonograph manufacturing various competing incompatible types of cylinder recordings were made. A standard system was decided upon by [[Edison Records]], [[Columbia Phonograph]], and other companies in the late 1880s. The standard cylinders are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} long, {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm}} in diameter, and play about {{convert|2|min}} of music or other sound.&lt;ref name="Adapters" /&gt;

Over the years the type of wax used in cylinders was improved and hardened so that cylinders could be played with good quality over 100 times. In 1902 Edison Records launched a line of improved hard wax cylinders marketed as "Edison Gold Molded Records".  The major development of this line of cylinders is that Edison had developed a process that allowed a mold to be made from a master cylinder which then permitted the production of several hundred cylinders to be made from the mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cylinder.de/guide_black-wax-cylinders.html|title=The Cylinder Archive - Cylinder Guide: Black Wax Cylinders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was labeled, "Gold Moulded" because of the gold vapor that was given off by gold electrodes used in the process.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;

Originally all cylinders sold had to be recorded live on the softer brown wax which wore out in as few as twenty playings. Later cylinders were reproduced either mechanically or by linking phonographs together with rubber tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cylinder.de/guide_brown-wax-cylinders.html|title=Brown Wax Cylinders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not completely satisfactory, the result was good enough to be sold.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Cylinders were sold in cardboard tubes with cardboard caps on each end, the upper one a removable lid. Like cylindrical containers for hats, they were simply called "boxes", the word still used by experienced collectors. Within them, the earliest soft wax cylinders came swathed in a separate length of thick cotton batting. Later molded hard-wax cylinders were sold in boxes with a cotton lining. Celluloid cylinders were sold in unlined boxes. These protective boxes were normally kept and used to house the cylinders after purchase. Their general appearance allowed bandleader [[John Philip Sousa]] to deride their contents as "canned music", an epithet he borrowed from [[Mark Twain]],&lt;ref&gt;Bierley, Paul Edmund, "The Incredible Band of John Philip Sousa". [[University of Illinois Press]], 2006. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; but that did not stop Sousa's band from profiting by recording on cylinders.

The earliest cylinder boxes have a plain brown paper exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped with the company name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around the outside of the box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.

In 1900, Thomas B Lambert was granted a patent that described a process for mass-producing cylinders made from [[celluloid]], an early hard plastic ([[Henri Lioret]] of France was producing celluloid cylinders as early as 1893, but they were individually recorded rather than molded). That same year, the Lambert Company of Chicago began selling cylinder records made of the material. They would not break if dropped and could be played thousands of times without wearing out, although the choice of the bright pink color of early cylinders was arguably a marketing error. The color was changed to black in 1903, but brown and blue cylinders were also produced. The coloring was purportedly done because the dye reduced surface noise. Unlike wax, the hard inflexible material could not be shaved and recorded over, but it had the advantage of being nearly permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cylinder.de/guide_lambert-cylinders.html|title=Lamberts_EN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phonographcylinders.com/lambert-replica-cylinder.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324014701/http://www.phonographcylinders.com/lambert-replica-cylinder.php |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such "indestructible" style cylinders are arguably the most durable form of sound recording produced in the entire era of analog audio media; they can withstand a greater number of playbacks before wearing out than later media such as the [[vinyl record]] or [[Compact Cassette|audio tape]]. Their only serious shortcoming is that the celluloid slowly shrinks over the years, so that if it is on a core of plaster, metal or other very unyielding material, the ever-increasing tension can ultimately cause the celluloid to split lengthwise. A typical Lambert cylinder will have shrunk by approximately 3&amp;nbsp;mm in length in the 100&amp;nbsp;years or so since its manufacture (the actual amount is very dependent on storage conditions). Thus the grooves will no longer be 100 per inch, and the cylinder will skip if played on a typical feed-screw-type machine. The diameter will also have shrunk and many such cylinders will no longer fit on the [[mandrel]] unless very carefully reamed to fit. Such cylinders can still be played quite satisfactorily on suitable modern equipment. The Lambert company was put out of business in 1906 due to repeated actions from Edison for patent infringement, which Lambert had not actually committed - it was the cost of defending the actions that eventually sank Lambert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

This superior technology was licensed by a few companies including the Indestructible Record Company in 1906 and [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]] in 1908. The [[Edison Bell]] company in Europe had separately licensed the technology and were able to market Edison's titles in both wax (popular series) and celluloid (indestructible series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Read |first1=Oliver |last2=Welch |first2=Walter L. |date=1976 |title=From Tinfoil to Stereo|edition=2|location=Indianapolis, Indiana |page=146|publisher= Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc. |isbn=0-672-21206-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lambert was able to license the process because the patent was not owned by the now defunct Lambert Company, but by Lambert himself.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Edison had introduced wax cylinders that played for nominally 4 minutes (instead of the usual 2) in 1909 under the ''Amberol'' brand.  These were made from a harder (and more easily breakable) form of wax to withstand the smaller stylus used to play them.  The longer playing time was achieved by shrinking the groove size and spacing them twice as close together.  In 1912, the Edison company eventually acquired Lambert's patents to the celluloid technology, and almost immediately started production under a variation of their existing ''Amberol'' brand as ''Edison Blue Amberol Records''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cylinder.de/guide_blue-amberol-cylinders.html|title=The Cylinder Archive - Cylinder Guide: Amberol and 4-minute Indestructible Cylinders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These new celluloid recordings were given a core made from [[plaster of Paris]].  The celluloid material itself was blue in color, but purple was introduced in 1919, "... for more sophisticated selections".  The use of the plaster core provided resistance to the shrinkage of the celluloid, but the playing surface is still liable to split if stored in less than ideal conditions.  The plaster core itself can deteriorate in conditions that are too damp or too dry.  Nevertheless, most Blue Amberol cylinders are, today, quite playable on antique phonographs or modern equipment alike (although the plaster core may need some reaming).{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Edison made several designs of phonographs both with internal and external horns for playing these improved cylinder records. The internal horn models were called ''Amberolas''. Edison marketed its "Fireside" model phonograph with a gearshift and a 'model K' reproducer with two styli that allowed it to play both 2-minute and 4-minute cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;Model Number taken directly from actual Fireside reproducer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversion kits were produced for some of the later model 2 minute phonographs adding a gear change and a second 'model H' reproducer.  These kits were shipped with a set of 12 (wax) Amberol cylinders in distinctive orange boxes.  The purchaser had no choice as to the titles.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==Disc records==
In the era before [[World War I]], phonograph cylinders and [[gramophone record|disc records]] competed with each other for public favor.

The audio fidelity of a sound groove is debatably better if it is engraved on a cylinder due to better linear tracking. This was not resolved until the advent of RIAA standards in the early 1940s—by which time it had already been rendered academic, as cylinder production stopped with Edison's last efforts in October 1929.

==Advantages of cylinders==
The cylinder system had certain advantages. As noted, wax cylinders could be used for home recordings, and "indestructible" types could be played over and over many more times than the disc. Cylinders usually rotated twice as fast as contemporary discs, but the linear velocity was comparable to the innermost grooves of the disc. In theory, this would provide generally poorer [[High fidelity|audio fidelity]]. Furthermore, since [[constant angular velocity]] translates into [[constant linear velocity]] (the radius of the [[helix|helical]] track is constant), cylinders were also free from inner groove problems suffered by disc recordings. Around 1900, cylinders were, on average, indeed of notably higher audio quality than contemporary discs, but as disc makers improved their technology by 1910 the fidelity differences between better discs and cylinders became minimal.

Cylinder phonographs generally used a [[worm drive|worm gear]] to move the stylus in synchronization with the grooves of the recording, whereas most disc machines relied on the grooves to pull the stylus along. This resulted in cylinder records played a number of times having less degradation than discs, but this added mechanism made cylinder machines more expensive.

==Advantages of discs==
Both the disc records, and the machines to play them, were cheaper to mass-produce than the products of the cylinder system. Disc records were also easier and cheaper to store in bulk, as they could be stacked, or when in paper sleeves put in rows on shelves like books—packed together more densely than cylinder recordings.

Many cylinder phonographs used a belt to turn the mandrel; slight slippage of this belt could make the mandrel turn unevenly, thus resulting in pitch fluctuations. Disc phonographs using a direct system of gears turned more evenly; the heavy metal turntable of disc machines acted as a flywheel, helping to minimize speed wobble.

Virtually all US disc records were single-sided until 1908, when [[Columbia Records]] began mass production of discs with recordings [[A-side and B-side|pressed on both sides]]. Except for premium-priced classical records, that quickly became the industry standard. With their capacity effectively doubled, the storage efficiency advantage of discs over the space-wasting cylinder format became even more obvious.

The disc companies had superior advertising and promotion, most notably the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in the United States and the [[Gramophone Company]]/[[HMV]] in the Commonwealth. Great singers like [[Enrico Caruso]] were hired to record exclusively, helping put the idea in the public mind that that company's product was superior. Edison tried to get into the disc market with [[Vertical cut recording|hill-and-dale]] discs, [[Edison Disc Record]]s.

==Decline==
[[File:PhonographCylinders.JPG|thumb|Disc records and cylinders]]
Cylinder records continued to compete with the growing disc record market into the 1910s, when discs won the commercial battle. In 1912, [[Columbia Records]], which had been selling both discs and cylinders, dropped the cylinder format, while Edison introduced his unique [[Edison Disc Record|Diamond Disc]] format. Beginning in 1915, new Edison cylinder issues were simply dubs of Edison discs and therefore had lower audio quality than the disc originals. Although his cylinders continued to be sold in steadily dwindling and eventually minuscule quantities, Edison continued to support owners of cylinder phonographs by making new titles available in that format until the company ceased manufacturing all records and phonographs in November 1929.&lt;!-- presumably still available into October, but no new titles added after mid-year. --&gt;&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;

==Later applications==

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their [[Dictabelt]] technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by [[magnetic tape]] recording. However, cylinders for older style dictating machines continued to be available for some years, and it was not unusual to encounter cylinder dictating machines into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Dictabelt"&gt;

In the late 20th and early 21st century some new recordings have been made on cylinders for the [[novelty effect]] of using obsolete technology. Probably the most famous of these are by [[They Might Be Giants]], who in 1996 recorded "I Can Hear You" and three other songs, performed without electricity, on an 1898 Edison wax recording studio phonograph at the [[Edison National Historic Site]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. This song was released on ''[[Factory Showroom]]'' in 1996 and re-released on the 2002 compilation ''[[Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants]]''. The other songs recorded were "James K. Polk", "Maybe I Know", and "The Edison Museum", the last a song about the site of the recording. These recordings were officially released online as MP3 files in 2001.&lt;ref name="giants"&gt;

In 2010 the British [[steampunk]] band [[The Men That Will Not Be Blamed For Nothing]] released the track "Sewer", from their debut album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Steampunk! Volume 1]]'' on a wax cylinder in a limited edition of 40, of which only 30 were put on sale.  The box set came with instructions on how to make your own cylinder player for less than £20. The [[BBC]] covered the release on Television on [[BBC Click]], on [[BBC Online]] and on [[Radio 5 Live]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/10171206.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tech Know: A journey into sound | date=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, [[Ash International]] and PARC released the first commercially available glow in the dark phonograph cylinder, a work by [[Michael Esposito (paranormal investigator)|Michael Esposito]] and [[Carl Michael von Hausswolff]], entitled ''The Ghosts Of Effingham''. The cylinder was released in a limited edition of 150 copies, and was produced by Vulcan Records in Sheffield, England.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

==Preservation of cylinder recordings==
[[File:HoldPhonoCylinder.jpg|thumbnail|Proper way to hold a cylinder record: put fingers on the inside; do not touch the outer surface which has the recording.]]
Because of the nature of the recording medium, playback of many cylinders can cause degradation of the recording. The replay of cylinders diminishes their fidelity and degrades their recorded signals. Additionally, when exposed to humidity, mold can penetrate cylinders' surface and cause the recordings to have surface noise. Currently, the only professional machine manufactured for the playback of cylinder recordings is the [[Archéophone]] player, designed by Henri Chamoux. The Archéophone is used by the Edison National Historic Site, [[Bowling Green State University]] (Bowling Green, Ohio), The Department of Special Collections, Donald C Davidson Library at The [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and many other libraries and archives.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Other modern so-called 'plug-in' mounts, each incorporating the use of a Stanton 500AL MK II magnetic cartridge, have been manufactured from time to time. Information on each may be viewed on the Phonograph Makers Pages link. It is possible to use these on the Edison cylinder players.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Also of interest is the cylinder player built by BBC engineers working in "Engineering Operations - Radio" in 1987.  This was equipped with a linear-tracking arm borrowed from a contemporary Revox turntable, and a variety of re-tipped Shure SC35 cartridges.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In an attempt to preserve the historic content of the recordings, cylinders can be read with a [[confocal microscope]] and converted to a [[digital recording|digital audio]] format. The resulting sound clip in most cases sounds better than stylus playback from the original cylinder. Having an electronic version of the original recordings enables archivists to open access to the recordings to a wider audience. This technique also has the potential to allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;Fadeyev &amp; Haber, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern reproductions of cylinder and disc recordings usually give the impression that the introduction of discs was a quantum leap in audio fidelity, but this is on modern playback equipment; played on equipment from around 1900, the cylinders do not have noticeably more rumble and poorer bass reproduction than the discs. Another factor is that many cylinders are amateur recordings, while disc recording equipment was simply too expensive for anyone but professional engineers; many extremely poor recordings were made on cylinder, while the vast majority of disc recordings were competently recorded.   All cylinder recordings were acoustically recorded as were early disc recordings.  From the mid-1920s onwards, discs started to be recorded electrically which provided a much enhanced frequency range of recording.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Also important is the quality of the material: the earliest tinfoil recordings wore out fast. Once the tinfoil was removed from the cylinder it was nearly impossible to re-align in playable condition. The earliest soft wax recordings also wore out quite fast, although they have better fidelity than the early rubber discs.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In addition to poor states of preservation, the poor impression modern listeners may get of wax cylinders is from their early date, which can compare unfavorably to recordings made even a dozen years later. Other than a single playable example from 1878 (from an experimental phonograph-clock), the oldest playable preserved cylinders are from the year 1888. These include a severely degraded recording of [[Johannes Brahms]], Handel's [[Israel in Egypt]] and a short speech by Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] in fairly listenable condition. Somewhat later are the almost unlistenable 1889 amateur recordings of [[Nina Grieg]]. The problem with the wax cylinders is that they readily support the growth of mildew which penetrates throughout the cylinder and, if serious enough, renders the recording unplayable. The earliest preserved rubber disc recordings are children's records, featuring animal noises and nursery rhymes. This means that the earliest disc recordings most music lovers will hear are shellac discs made after 1900, after more than ten years of development.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

In [[sociology]], the '''post-industrial society''' is the stage of society's development when the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] generates more wealth than the [[secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]] of the economy.

The term was originated by [[Alain Touraine]] and is closely related to similar sociological theoretical constructs such as [[post-Fordism]], [[information society]], [[knowledge economy]], [[post-industrial economy]], [[late modernity|liquid modernity]], and [[network society]]. They all can be used in economics or social science disciplines as a general theoretical backdrop in [[research design]].

As the term has been used, a few common themes, including the ones below have begun to emerge.

# The economy undergoes a transition from the production of goods to the provision of services.
# Knowledge becomes a valued form of capital; see [[Human capital]].
# Producing ideas is the main way to grow the economy.
# Through processes of globalization and automation, the value and importance to the economy of [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], unionized work, including manual labor (e.g., assembly-line work) decline, and those of professional workers (e.g., scientists, creative-industry professionals, and IT professionals) grow in value and prevalence.
# Behavioral and information sciences and technologies are developed and implemented. (e.g., [[behavioral economics]], [[information architecture]], [[cybernetics]], [[game theory]] and [[information theory]].)

==Origins==
[[Daniel Bell]] popularized the term through his 1974 work ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''.&lt;ref name="Bell, Daniel 1974"&gt;Bell, Daniel. The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have credited Bell with coining the term,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.economist.com/node/18061086?story_id=18061086 Ahead of the curve]'', Schumpeter, [[The Economist]], Feb 3rd 2011&lt;/ref&gt; French sociologist [[Alain Touraine]] published in 1969 the first major work on the post-industrial society. The term was also used extensively by social philosopher [[Ivan Illich]] in his 1973 paper ''[[Tools for Conviviality]]'' and appears occasionally in Leftist texts throughout the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, James Weinstein, 'Studies on the Left: R.I.P.', ''Radical America: An SDS Magazine'', vol.1, no.3 (Nov-Dec, 1967), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has grown and changed as it became mainstream. The term is now used by admen such as [[Seth Godin]],&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth . ''Linchpin'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; public policy PhD's such as Keith Boeckelman,&lt;ref&gt;The American States in the Postindustrial Economy. The State and Local Government Review. on the web: https://www.jstor.org/pss/4355128&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologists such as [[Neil Fligstein]] and Ofer Sharone.&lt;ref&gt;Work in the Postindustrial Economy of California. (2002) On the web http://www.russellsage.org/publications/workingpapers/workpostindcalif/document&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. President Bill Clinton even used the term to describe Chinese growth in a round-table discussion in Shanghai in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;1999 Forward to "The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society" by Daniel Bell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of knowledge==
The post-industrialized society is marked by an increased valuation of knowledge. This itself is unsurprising, having been foreshadowed in [[Daniel Bell]]'s presumption as to how economic employment patterns will evolve in such societies. He asserts employment will grow faster in the tertiary (and quaternary) sector relative to employment in the primary and secondary sector and that the tertiary (and quaternary) sectors will take precedence in the economy. This will continue to occur such that the“impact of the expert”will expand and power will be monopolized by knowledge.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"&gt;Targ, Harry R. "Global Dominance and Dependence, Post-Industrialism, and International Relations Theory: A Review." International Studies Quarterly. 20. 3 (1976): 461-482.&lt;/ref&gt;

As tertiary and quaternary sector positions are essentially knowledge-oriented, this will result in a restructuring of education, at least in its nuances.  The“new power… of the expert”consequently gives rise to the growing role of universities and research institutes in post-industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Post-industrial societies themselves become oriented around these places of knowledge production and production of experts as their new foci. Consequently, the greatest beneficiaries in the post-industrial society are young urban professionals. As a new, educated, and politicized generation more impassioned by liberalism, social justice, and environmentalism the shift of power into their hands, as a result of their knowledge endowments, is often cited as a good thing.&lt;ref name="Wright, James D. 1978"&gt;Wright, James D.“The Political Consciousness of Post-Industrialism.” Contemporary Sociology. 7. 3 (1978): 270-273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"&gt;Banks, Alan and Jim Foster.“The Mystifications of Post-Industrialism. Appalachian Journal . 10. 4 (1983): 372-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing importance of knowledge in post-industrial societies results in a general increase in expertise through the economy and throughout society. In this manner, it eliminates what Alan Banks and Jim Foster identify as “undesirable work as well as the grosser forms of poverty and inequality.” This effect is supplemented by the aforementioned movement of power into the hands of young educated people concerned with social justice.&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"/&gt;

Economists at Berkeley have studied the value of knowledge as a form of [[human capital|capital]], adding value to material capital, such as factory or a truck. Speaking along the same lines of their argument, the addition or 'production' of knowledge, could become the basis of what would undoubtably be considered 'post-industrial' policies meant to deliver economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Czarnitzki, Dirk; Hall Bronwyn H. (Berkeley); Oriani Raffaele; ''The Market Valuation of Knowledge Assets in US and European Firms.'' On the web at http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/papers/CHO05_mktval.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity culture==
Similarly, post-industrial society has serviced the creative culture. Many of those most well-equipped to thrive in an increasingly technological society are young adults with tertiary education. As education itself becomes more and more oriented towards producing people capable of answering the need for self-actualization, creativity, and self-expression, successive generations become more endowed with the ability to contribute to and perpetuate such industries. This nuanced change in education, as well among the emerging class of young professionals, is itself initiated by what James D Wright identifies as an “unprecedented economic affluence and the satiation of basic material needs.”&lt;ref name="Wright, James D. 1978"/&gt; [[Ellen Dunham-Jones]] as well observes this feature of post-industrial society where “abundant goods [are] equitably distributed [in order that] laborless leisure and self-determination” can be consumed.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"&gt;Dunham-Jones, Ellen. “New Urbanism as a Counter-Project to Post-Industrialism [The Promise of New Urbanism].” Places. 13. 2 (2000): 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-industrial society is repeatedly stressed to be one where knowledge is power and technology is the instrument.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Naturally, where one is creatively inclined, they are advantaged by such a society. The doctrine of “speed, mobility and malleability” is well suited to a dynamic creative industry and as industries of good production decrease in precedence, the way is paved for artists, musicians, and other such types, whose skills are better utilized by the tertiary and quaternary sector.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Urban geographer Trevor Barnes, in his work outlining the Vancouver experience in post-war development, evokes the post-industrial condition, citing the emergence and consolidation of a significant video games industry as a constituent of the elite service sector.&lt;ref name="Barnes, T 2011"&gt;Barnes, T et al. “Vancouver: Restructuring narratives in the transnational metropolis.” Canadian urban regions: trajectories of growth and change. Eds. L Bourne et al. (2011): 291-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

This increased faculty of the post-industrialist society with respects to the creative industry is itself reflected by the economic history of post-industrial societies. As economic activities shift from primarily primary and secondary sector-based to tertiary, and later quaternary, sector-based, cities in which this shift occurs become more open to exchanges of information.&lt;ref name="Golden, Miriam 2006"&gt;Golden, Miriam &amp; Michael Wallerstein. “Domestic and International Causes for the Rise of Pay Inequality: Post-Industrialism, Globalization and Labor Market Institutions.” The Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, UCLA (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This is necessitated by the demands of a tertiary and quaternary sector: in order to better service an industry focused on finance, education, communication, management, training, engineering, and aesthetic design, the city must become points of exchange capable of providing the most updated information from across the globe. Conversely, as cities become a convergence of international ideas, the tertiary and quaternary sector can be expected to grow.&lt;ref name="Barnes, T 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden, Miriam 2006"/&gt;

A virtual cult of 'creatives' have sprung up embodying and often describing and defending the post-industrial ethos. They argue that businesses that create intangibles have taken a more prominent role in the wake of manufacturing's decline.

Actor and then-artistic director of the [[Old Vic Theatre]], [[Kevin Spacey]], has argued the economic case for the arts in terms of providing jobs and being of greater importance in exports than manufacturing (as well as an educational role) in a guest column he wrote for ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6251188.ece Kevin Spacey makes an economic case for the arts{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Post-industrialism is criticized for the amount of real fundamental change it produces in society, if any at all. A mild view held by Alan Banks and Jim Foster contends that representations of post-industrial society by advocates assume professional, educated [[elite|elites]] were previously less relevant than they have become in the new [[social order]], and that changes that have occurred are minor but greatly embellished.&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"/&gt; More critical views see the entire process as the highest evolution of [[capitalism]], wherein the system produces [[commodities]] as opposed to practical goods and is determined privately instead of socially. This view is complemented by the assertion that “the characteristic feature of a modern [that is, post-industrial] society is that it is a [[technocracy]].”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Such societies then become notable for their ability to subvert [[social consciousness]] through powers of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] rather than powers of [[coercion]], reflective of the “ideology of the ruling class [as] … predominantly managerial.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;

In line with the view that nothing fundamental has changed in the transition from industrial societies to post-industrial societies is the insistence of lingering problems from past development periods. [[Neo-Malthusian]] in essence, this outlook focuses on post-industrial society’s continuing struggle with issues of resource [[scarcity]], [[overpopulation]], and [[environmental degradation]], all of which are remnants from its industrial history.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"&gt;Gibson, Donald E. “Post-Industrialism: Prosperity or Decline?” Sociological Focus. 26. 2 (1993): 147-163.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by a “[[corporate liberalism]]” that seeks to continue [[economic growth]] through “the creation and satisfaction of [[false needs]],” or as [[Christopher Lasch]] more derisively refers to it, “subsidized waste.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;

[[Urban development]] in the context of post-industrialism is also a point of contention. In opposition to the view that the new leaders of post-industrial society are increasingly environmentally aware, this critique asserts that it rather leads to environmental degradation, this being rooted in the patterns of development. [[Urban sprawl]], characterised behaviourally by cities “expanding at the periphery in even lower densities” and physically by “[[office park|office parks]], [[Shopping mall|malls]], strips, condo clusters, corporate campuses and gated communities,” is singled out as the main issue.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Resulting from a post-industrialist culture of “[[mobile capital]], the [[service economy]], post-Fordist disposable [[consumerism]] and [[banking deregulation]],” urban sprawl has caused post-industrialism to become environmentally and socially regressive.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Of the former, environmental degradation results from encroachment as cities meet demands on low-density habitation; the wider spread of population consumes more of the environment while necessitating more energy consumption in order to facilitate travel within the ever-growing city, incurring greater pollution.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; This process evokes the neo-Malthusian concerns of overpopulation and resource scarcity that inevitably lead to environmental deterioration.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"/&gt; Of the latter, “post-industrialism’s doctrine of … mobility and malleability” encourage a disconnect between communities where social belonging falls into the category of things considered by the “post-Fordist disposable consumer[ist]” attitude as interchangeable, expendable, and replaceable.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt;

Post-industrialism as a concept is highly [[western culture|Western]]-centric. Theoretically and effectively, it is only possible in the Global West, which its proponents assume to be solely capable of fully realizing industrialization and then post-industrialization. [[Herman Kahn]] optimistically predicted the “economic growth, expanded production and growing efficiency” of post-industrial societies and the resultant “material abundance and… high [[quality of life]]” to extend to “almost all people in Western societies” and only “some in Eastern societies.”&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"/&gt; This prediction is treated elsewhere by contentions that the post-industrial society merely perpetuates capitalism.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt;

Recalling the critical assertion that all modern societies are technocracies, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|T. Roszak]] completes the analysis by stating that “all societies are moving in the direction of technocracies.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; From this, the foremost “suave technocracies” reside in the West, whereas all others are successively graded in descending order: “vulgar technocracies,” “[[teratoid]] technocracies,” and finally “comic opera technocracies.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; This view importantly presumes one transition and furthermore one path of transition for societies to undergo, i.e. the one that Western societies are slated to complete. Much like the [[demographic transition]] model, this prediction does not entertain the idea of an Eastern or other alternative model of transitional development.

===Neologism===
When historians and sociologists considered the revolution that followed the agricultural society they did not call it a "post-agricultural society". "Post-industrial society" signifies only a departure, not a positive description.&lt;ref&gt;Veneris, Yannis. The Informational Revolution, Cybernetics and Urban Modelling, PhD Thesis, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 1984. This thesis explored trends and theories (general economic and regional), and developed a large scale dynamic simulation model of the transition from an industrial to an informational economy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veneris, Yannis. Modeling the transition from the Industrial to the Informational Revolution, Environment and Planning A 22(3):399-416, 1990. [http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a220399]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the word's early users, [[Ivan Illich]], prefigured this criticism and invented the term Conviviality, or the [[Convivial Society]], to stand as a positive description of his version of a post-industrial society.

===Social critique===
A group of scholars (including [[Allen J. Scott|Allen Scott]] and [[Edward Soja]]) argue that industry remains at the center of the whole process of capitalist accumulation, with services not only becoming increasingly industrialized and automated but also remaining highly dependent on industrial growth.

Some observers, including Soja (building on the theories of the French philosopher of urbanism [[Henri Lefebvre]]), suggest that although industry may be based outside of a "post-industrial" nation, that nation cannot ignore industry's necessary sociological importance.

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites). 
For comparison, the [[International Space Station]] orbits in the {{convert|300|–|400|km}} range, and the [[2009 satellite collision]] and [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|2007 antisat test]] occurred at {{convert|800|to|900|km}} altitude.&lt;ref name=nasa9&gt;

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J.

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L.

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred.

In 1958, the United States launched [[Vanguard I]] into a [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO). {{As of|2009|10}}, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving man-made space objects still in orbit.&lt;ref name="usaweekend"&gt;Julian Smith, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070826/070826space.html#junk "Space Junk"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''USA Weekend'', 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/nrl-vic031308.php Vanguard 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] listed 902 operational satellites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html "UCS Satellite Database"] ''Union of Concerned Scientists'', 16 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

===== Space Shuttle missions =====

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

NASA's study concluded that debris accounted for half of the overall risk to the Shuttle.&lt;ref name=threat&gt;Kelly, John.

''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', Volume 169 Number 10 (15 September 2008), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive-level decision to proceed was required if catastrophic impact was likelier than 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Kessler Syndrome and manned spacecraft}}Kessler syndrome ====
{{Main|Kessler syndrome}}
Although most manned space activity takes place at altitudes below {{convert|800|to|1500|km|abbr=on}}, a Kessler syndrome cascade in that region would rain down into lower altitudes and the decay time scale is such that "the resulting [low Earth orbit] debris environment is likely to be too hostile for future space use".&lt;ref name=k9163&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J.

In a Kessler syndrome, satellite lifetimes would be measured in years or months. New satellites could be launched through the debris field into higher orbits or placed in lower orbits (where decay removes the debris), but the utility of the region between {{convert|800|and|1500|km|abbr=on}} is the reason for its amount of debris.&lt;ref name=graph /&gt;

A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed.

When originally proposed in 2015, the [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb constellation]], initially planned to have ~700 satellites anticipated on orbit after 2018, would only state that they would re-enter the atmosphere within 25 years of retirement.&lt;ref name=sn20150615&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacenews.com/airbus-wins-oneweb-contract/ |title=OneWeb Taps Airbus To Build 900 Internet Smallsats |work=SpaceNews |accessdate=19 June 2015 |date=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By October 2017, both OneWeb—and also SpaceX, with their large [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink constellation]]—had filed documents with the US [[FCC]] with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans.  Both companies committed to a deorbit plan for post-mission satellites which will explicitly move the satellites into orbits where they will reenter the Earth's atmosphere within approximately one year following end-of-life.&lt;ref name=ars20171004&gt;

With a "one-up, one-down" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902 /&gt; Another possibility is the [[Mission Extension Vehicle|robotic]] [[Space Infrastructure Servicing|refueling]] of satellites.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.&lt;ref name= Anselmo /&gt; Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French [[SPOT (satellites)|Spot-1 satellite]], reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from {{convert|830|km|0|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|550|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Moliner, [http://www.aiaa.org/spaceops2002archive/papers/SpaceOps02-P-T3-30.pdf "Spot-1 Earth Observation Satellite Deorbitation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116030335/http://www.aiaa.org/Spaceops2002Archive/papers/SpaceOps02-P-T3-30.pdf |date=16 January 2011 }}, AIAA, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.com/resources/downloads/data/spacecraft-digest/display.aspx?i=3352 "Spacecraft: Spot 3"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930142847/http://www.agi.com/resources/downloads/data/spacecraft-digest/display.aspx?i=3352 |date=30 September 2011 }}, agi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an [[electrodynamic tether]] could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Christensen, [http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_tether_041117.html "The Terminator Tether Aims to Clean Up Low Earth Orbit"], space.com.

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, [[Spacecraft capture|capture]] it temporarily to attach a [[smallsat|smaller de-orbit satellite]] and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for [[atmospheric entry]] or move it to a graveyard orbit.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model.

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabbard diagram.png|thumb|alt=Debris graph of altitude and orbital period|Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000]]
The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

UNEP. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]] and other [[hydrocarbon]] resources may have the potential to become stranded as the world engages in a [[fossil fuel phase out]].

The term is important to financial [[risk management]] in order to avoid [[pure economic loss|economic loss]] after an [[asset]] has been converted to a [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]]. Accountants have measures to deal with the impairment of assets (e.g. [[IAS 16]]) which seek to ensure that an entity’s assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iasplus.com/en/standards/ias/ias16 | title=IAS 16 | publisher=Deloitte | date=9 July 2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, stranded assets are also defined as an asset that has become obsolete or [[Non-performing asset|non-performing]], but must be recorded on the balance sheet as a loss of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/stranded-asset.html | title=Stranded Asset | publisher=Business Dictionary | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the context of the environment ==

The term ''stranded assets'' has gained significant prominence in environmental and climate change discourses, where the focus has been on how environment-related factors (such as climate change policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carbontracker.org | title=Unburnable Carbon | publisher=[[Carbon Tracker Initiative]] | date=9 July 2014 | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) could strand assets in different sectors.&lt;ref name="bacr"/&gt; According to the Stranded Assets Programme at the [[University of Oxford]]'s [[Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment]], some of the environment-related risk factors that could result in stranded assets are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/stranded-assets/ | title=Stranded Assets Programme | publisher=Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=11 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327230917/http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/stranded-assets/ | archivedate=27 March 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* environmental challenges (e.g. climate change, [[natural capital]] degradation)
* changing resource landscapes including [[resource depletion]] (e.g. shale-gas abundance, phosphate scarcity)
* new government regulations (e.g. carbon pricing, air pollution regulation, carbon bubble)
* falling clean-technology costs (e.g. solar PV, onshore wind, electric vehicles)
* evolving social norms (e.g. fossil fuel divestment campaign) and consumer behaviour (e.g. certification schemes)
* [[Lawsuit|litigation]] (e.g. carbon liability) and changing statutory interpretations (e.g. fiduciary duty, disclosure requirements)

In the context of upstream energy production, the IEA defines stranded assets as "those investments which are made but which, at some time prior to the end of their economic life (as assumed at the investment decision point), are no longer able to earn an economic return, as a result of changes in the market and regulatory environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/WEO_Special_Report_2013_Redrawing_the_Energy_Climate_Map.pdf WEO Special Report 2013, IEA] IEA, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[carbon bubble]] is one popular example of how an environment-related risk factor could create stranded assets. Another example is pre-end of life decommissioning of nuclear power stations, decided by the German government and debated in Japan after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]. In financial terms, not only is the payback time of the asset curtailed, acceleration of decommissioning liabilities also increases their net present cost. When decisions result from changes to government legislation, liabilities exceeding decommissioning provisions accumulated over the asset's useful life may need to be shouldered by the tax payer, as opposed to the owner/operator.

In discussions of electric power generation deregulation, the related term [[stranded costs]] represents the existing investments in infrastructure for the incumbent utility that may become redundant in a competitive environment.

== Other stranded assets ==

Technology change may cause other stranded assets. For example moving to [[Transportation network company|'transport as a service']] (shared cars) may mean that much car manufacturing capacity, and associated insurance capacity, becomes stranded.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-saft/the-age-of-stranded-assets-isnt-just-about-climate-change-james-saft-idUSKBN19Y2SV&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technological determinism''' is a [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[theory]] that assumes that a society's [[technology]] [[determinism|determines]] the development of its social structure and cultural values. Technological determinism tries to understand how technology has had an impact on human action and thought. Changes in technology are the primary source for changes in society. The term is believed to have originated from [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely [[Clarence Ayres]] who was a follower of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]]. [[William Ogburn]] was also known for his radical technological determinism.

The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist [[Karl Marx]], whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically [[Productive forces|productive technology]], are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith &amp; Marx|first= Merrit Roe &amp; Leo |title= Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|publisher= The MIT Press|date=June 1994|isbn= 978-0262691673}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|title=Karl Marx and the Three Faces of Technological Determinism|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=May 1990|volume=20|issue=2|pages=333–351|doi=10.1177/030631290020002006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The term is believed to have been coined by Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American social scientist. Veblen's contemporary, popular historian Charles A. Beard, provided this apt determinist image, "Technology marches in seven-league boots from one ruthless, revolutionary conquest to another, tearing down old factories and industries, flinging up new processes with terrifying rapidity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beard|first=Charles A.|title=Time, Technology, and the Creative Spirit in Political Science|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=February 1927|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/1945535|jstor=1945535}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to the meaning, it is described as the ascription to machines of "powers" that they do not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Does Technology Drive History?: The Dilemma of Technological Determinism|last=Smith|first=Merritt|last2=Marx|first2=Leo|publisher=MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0262193474|location=Cambridge|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veblen, for instance, asserted that "the machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times And Ideas Of The Great Economic Thinkers|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|isbn=978-0684862149|location=New York|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of Karl Marx who expected that the construction of the railway in India would dissolve the caste system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general idea, according to [[Robert Heilbroner]], is that technology, by way of its machines, can cause historical change by changing the material conditions of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing Machines: Essays on Technical Change|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0262631884|location=Cambridge|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most radical technological determinists was a man named [[Clarence Edwin Ayres|Clarence Ayres]], who was a follower of Veblen's theory in the 20th century. Ayers is best known for developing economic philosophies, but he also worked closely with Veblen who coined the technological determinism theory.  He often times talked about the struggle between technology and ceremonial structure. One of his most notable theories involved the concept of "technological drag" where he explains technology as a self-generating process and institutions as ceremonial and this notion creates a technological over-determinism in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Limits to Economic Theory|last=Mulberg|first=Jonathan|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=978-0415123860|location=London|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Explanation ==
Technological determinism seeks to show technical developments, media, or technology as a whole, as the key mover in history and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=William M.|title=Culture Conglomerates: Consolidation in the Motion Picture and Television Industries|year=2006|publisher=Publisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0742540668|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory subscribed by "hyperglobalist" who claims that as a consequence of the wide availability of technology, accelerated globalization is inevitable. Therefore, technological development and innovation become the principal motor of social, economic or political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict adherents to technological determinism do not believe the influence of technology differs based on how much a technology is or can be used.  Instead of considering technology as part of a larger spectrum of human activity, technological determinism sees technology as the basis for all human activity.

Technological determinism has been summarized as 'The belief in technology as a key governing force in society ...' ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]). 'The idea that technological development determines social change ...' (Bruce Bimber). It changes the way people think and how they interact with others and can be described as '...a three-word logical proposition: "Technology determines history"' ([[Rosalind Williams]]) &lt;!--[thanks to Brian Martin: http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/96BRmetascience.html"].--&gt;. It is, '... the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course.' ([[Michael L. Smith]]). This 'idea of progress' or 'doctrine of progress' is centralised around the idea that social problems can be solved by technological advancement, and this is the way that society moves forward. Technological determinists believe that "'You can't stop progress', implying that we are unable to control technology" ([[Lelia Green]]). This suggests that we are somewhat powerless and society allows technology to drive social changes because, "societies fail to be aware of the alternatives to the values embedded in it [technology]" ([[Merritt Roe Smith]]).

Technological determinism has been defined as an approach that identifies technology, or technological advances, as the central causal element in processes of social change (Croteau and Hoynes). As a technology is stabilized, its design tends to dictate users' behaviors, consequently diminishing human agency. This stance however ignores the social and cultural circumstances in which the technology was developed. Sociologist Claude Fischer (1992) characterized the most prominent forms of technological determinism as "billiard ball" approaches, in which technology is seen as an external force introduced into a social situation, producing a series of ricochet effects.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau and Hoynes, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than acknowledging that a society or culture interacts with and even shapes the technologies that are used, a technological determinist view holds that "the uses made of technology are largely determined by the structure of the technology itself, that is, that its functions follow from its form" ([[Neil Postman]]). However, this is not to be confused with [[Daniel Chandler]]'s "inevitability thesis", which states that once a technology is introduced into a culture that what follows is the inevitable development of that technology.

For example, we could examine why Romance Novels have become so dominant in our society compared to other forms of novels like the Detective or Western novel. We might say that it was because of the invention of the perfect binding system developed by publishers. This was where glue was used instead of the time-consuming and very costly process of binding books by sewing in separate signatures. This meant that these books could be mass-produced for the wider public. We would not be able to have mass literacy without mass production.{{clarify|Society could mass produce books on any theme. This does not explain how Romance became more dominant than Detective or Western novels. Its relevance to the idea of Technological Determinism is dubious, as well.|date=May 2014}} This example is closely related to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s belief that print helped produce the [[nation state]]. This moved society on from an oral culture to a literate culture but also introduced a capitalist society where there was clear class distinction and individualism. As Postman maintains  &lt;!-- This is a poor example of technological determinism --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Hard and soft determinism ==

In examining [[determinism]], '''hard determinism''' can be contrasted with '''soft determinism'''. A [[compatibilist]] says that it is possible for [[free will]] and determinism to exist in the world together, while an [[incompatibilist]] would say that they can not and there must be one or the other.  Those who support [[determinism]] can be further divided.

'''''Hard determinists''''' would view technology as developing independent from social concerns. They would say that technology creates a set of powerful forces acting to regulate our social activity and its meaning.  According to this view of determinism we organize ourselves to meet the needs of technology and the outcome of this organization is beyond our control or we do not have the freedom to make a choice regarding the outcome (autonomous technology). The 20th century French philosopher and social theorist [[Jacques Ellul]] could be said to be a hard determinist and proponent of autonomous technique (technology).  In his 1954 work ''[[:fr:La Technique ou l'Enjeu du siècle|The Technological Society]]'', Ellul essentially posits that technology, by virtue of its power through efficiency, determines which social aspects are best suited for its own development through a process of natural selection.  A social system's values, morals, philosophy etc. that are most conducive to the advancement of technology allow that social system to enhance its power and spread at the expense of those social systems whose values, morals, philosophy etc. are less promoting of technology.  [[Theodore J. Kaczynski]] (the Unabomber) can be essentially thought of as a hard determinist.  According to Kaczynski, "objective" material factors in the human environment are the principal determining factors in the evolution of social systems. While geography, climate, and other "natural" factors largely determined the parameters of social conditions for most of human history, technology has recently become the dominant objective factor (largely due to forces unleashed by the industrial revolution) and it has been the principal objective and determining factor.

'''''Soft determinism''''', as the name suggests, is a more passive view of the way technology interacts with socio-political situations.  Soft determinists still subscribe to the fact that technology is the guiding force in our evolution, but would maintain that we have a ''chance'' to make decisions regarding the outcomes of a situation.  This is not to say that free will exists, but that the possibility for us to ''roll the dice'' and see what the outcome is exists. A slightly different variant of soft determinism is the 1922 technology-driven theory of social change proposed by [[William Fielding Ogburn]], in which society must adjust to the consequences of major inventions, but often does so only after a period of [[cultural lag]].&lt;!-- This section needs a reference --&gt;

== Technology as neutral ==
Individuals who consider technology as neutral see technology as neither good nor bad and what matters are the ways in which we use technology.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], "The Myth of Value-Neutrality", pp. 235-241, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a neutral viewpoint is, "guns are neutral and its up to how we use them whether it would be 'good or bad'" (Green, 2001). Mackenzie and Wajcman&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; believe that technology is neutral only if it's never been used before, or if no one knows what it is going to be used for (Green, 2001). In effect, guns would be classified as neutral if and only if society were none the wiser of their existence and functionality (Green, 2001). Obviously, such a society is non-existent and once becoming knowledgeable about technology, the society is drawn into a social progression where nothing is 'neutral about society' (Green). According to [[Lelia Green]], if one believes technology is neutral, one would disregard the cultural and social conditions that technology has produced (Green, 2001). This view is also referred to as technological instrumentalism.

In what is often considered a definitive reflection on the topic, the historian [[Melvin Kranzberg]] famously wrote in the first of his [[Kranzberg's laws of technology|six laws of technology]]: "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral."

== Criticism ==
Scepticism about technological determinism emerged alongside increased pessimism about techno-science in the mid-20th century, in particular around the use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in the production of [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]], and the problems of economic development in the [[Third World]]. As a direct consequence, desire for greater control of the course of development of technology gave rise to disenchantment with the model of technological determinism in academia.

Modern theorists of technology and society no longer consider technological determinism to be a very accurate view of the way in which we interact with technology, even though determinist assumptions and language fairly saturate the writings of many boosters of technology, the business pages of many popular magazines, and much reporting on technology {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.  Instead, research in [[science and technology studies]], [[social construction of technology]] and related fields have emphasised more nuanced views that resist easy causal formulations. They emphasise that "The relationship between technology and society cannot be reduced to a simplistic cause-and-effect formula. It is, rather, an 'intertwining'", whereby technology does not determine but "operates, and are operated upon in a complex social field" (Murphie and Potts).

In his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with Technology," [[Andrew Feenberg]] argues that technological determinism is not a very well founded concept by illustrating that two of the founding theses of determinism are easily questionable and in doing so calls for what he calls [[democratic rationalization]] ([[Feenberg]] 210–212).

Prominent opposition to technologically determinist thinking has emerged within work on the [[social construction of technology]] (SCOT). SCOT research, such as that of Mackenzie and Wajcman (1997) argues that the path of innovation and its social consequences are strongly, if not entirely shaped by society itself through the influence of culture, politics, economic arrangements, regulatory mechanisms and the like. In its strongest form, verging on [[social determinism]], "What matters is not the technology itself, but the social or economic system in which it is embedded" ([[Langdon Winner]]).

In his influential but contested (see Woolgar and Cooper, 1999) article "Do Artifacts Have Politics?", [[Langdon Winner]] illustrates not a form of determinism but the various sources of the politics of technologies. Those politics can stem from the intentions of the designer and the culture of the society in which a technology emerges or can stem from the technology itself, a "practical necessity" for it to function. For instance, New York City urban planner [[Robert Moses]] is purported to have built Long Island's parkway tunnels too low for buses to pass in order to keep minorities away from the island's beaches, an example of externally inscribed politics. On the other hand, an authoritarian command-and-control structure is a practical necessity of a nuclear power plant if radioactive waste is not to fall into the wrong hands. As such, Winner neither succumbs to technological determinism nor social determinism. The source of a technology's politics is determined only by carefully examining its features and history.

Although "The deterministic model of technology is widely propagated in society" ([[Sarah Miller]]), it has also been widely questioned by scholars. [[Lelia Green]] explains that, "When technology was perceived as being outside society, it made sense to talk about technology as neutral". Yet, this idea fails to take into account that culture is not fixed and society is dynamic. When "Technology is implicated in social processes, there is nothing neutral about society" ([[Lelia Green]]). This confirms one of the major problems with "technological determinism and the resulting denial of human responsibility for change. There is a loss of human involvement that shape technology and society" ([[Sarah Miller]]).

Another conflicting idea is that of [[technological somnambulism]], a term coined by Winner in his essay "Technology as Forms of Life".  Winner wonders whether or not we are simply ''sleepwalking'' through our existence with little concern or knowledge as to how we truly interact with technology. In this view, it is still possible for us to wake up and once again take control of the direction in which we are traveling (Winner 104). However, it requires society to adopt [[Ralph Schroeder]]'s claim that, "users don't just passively consume technology, but actively transform it".

In opposition to technological determinism are those who subscribe to the belief of [[social determinism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Social determinists believe that social circumstances alone select which technologies are adopted, with the result that no technology can be considered "inevitable" solely on its own merits. Technology and culture are not neutral and when knowledge comes into the equation, technology becomes implicated in social processes. The knowledge of how to create and enhance technology, and of how to use technology is socially bound knowledge. Postmodernists take another view, suggesting that what is right or wrong is dependent on circumstance. They believe technological change can have implications on the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Leila|year=2001|title=Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest|page=15|isbn=9781865080482}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they believe technological change is influenced by changes in government policy, society and culture, they consider the notion of change to be a paradox, since change is constant.

Media and cultural studies theorist [[Brian Winston]], in response to technological determinism, developed a model for the emergence of new technologies which is centered on the [[Law of the suppression of radical potential]]. In two of his books – ''Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television'' (1997) and ''Media Technology and Society'' (1998) – Winston applied this model to show how technologies evolve over time, and how their 'invention' is mediated and controlled by society and societal factors which suppress the radical potential of a given technology.

==The stirrup==
{{main|Great Stirrup Controversy}}

One continued argument for technological determinism is centered on the stirrup and its impact on the creation of [[feudalism]] in Europe in the late 8th century/early 9th century. [[Lynn White]] is credited with first drawing this parallel between feudalism and the stirrup in his book ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'', stating that as "it made possible mounted [[shock combat]]", the new form of war made the soldier that much more efficient in supporting feudal townships (White, 2). According to White, the superiority of the stirrup in combat was found in the mechanics of the lance charge: "The stirrup made possible- though it did not demand- a vastly more effective mode of attack: now the rider could law his lance at rest, held between the upper arm and the body, and make at his foe, delivering the blow not with his muscles but with the combined weight of himself and his charging stallion (White, 2)." White draws from a large research base, particularly [[Heinrich Brunner]]'s "Der Reiterdienst und die Anfänge des Lehnwesens" in substantiating his claim of the emergence of feudalism. In focusing on the evolution of warfare, particularly that of cavalry in connection with [[Charles Martel]]'s "diversion of a considerable part of the Church's vast military riches...from infantry to cavalry", White draws from Brunner's research and identifies the stirrup as the underlying cause for such a shift in military division and the subsequent emergence of feudalism (White, 4). Under the new brand of warfare garnered from the stirrup, White implicitly argues in favor of technological determinism as the vehicle by which feudalism was created.

Though an accomplished work, White's ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' has since come under heavy scrutiny and condemnation. The most volatile critics of White's argument at the time of its publication, P.H. Sawyer and R.H. Hilton, call the work as a whole "a misleading adventurist cast to old-fashioned platitudes with a chain of obscure and dubious deductions from scanty evidence about the progress of technology (Sawyer and Hilton, 90)." They further condemn his methods and, by association, the validity of technological determinism: "Had Mr. White been prepared to accept the view that the English and Norman methods of fighting were not so very different in the eleventh century, he would have made the weakness of his argument less obvious, but the fundamental failure would remain: the stirrup cannot alone explain the changes it made possible (Sawyer and Hilton, 91)." For Sawyer and Hilton, though the stirrup may be useful in the implementation of feudalism, it cannot be credited for the creation of feudalism alone.

Despite the scathing review of White's claims, the technological determinist aspect of the stirrup is still in debate. [[Alex Roland]], author of "Once More into the Stirrups; Lynne White Jr, Medieval Technology and Social Change", provides an intermediary stance: not necessarily lauding White's claims, but providing a little defense against Sawyer and Hilton's allegations of gross intellectual negligence. Roland views White's focus on technology to be the most relevant and important aspect of ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' rather than the particulars of its execution: "But can these many virtues, can this utility for historians of technology, outweigh the most fundamental standards of the profession? Can historians of technology continue to read and assign a book that is, in the words of a recent critic, "shot through with over-simplification, with a progression of false connexions between cause and effect, and with evidence presented selectively to fit with [White's] own pre-conceived ideas"? The answer, I think, is yes, at least a qualified yes (Roland, 574-575)." Objectively, Roland claims ''Medieval Technology and Social Change'' a variable success, at least as "Most of White's argument stands... the rest has sparked useful lines of research (Roland, 584)." This acceptance of technological determinism is ambiguous at best, neither fully supporting the theory at large nor denouncing it, rather placing the construct firmly in the realm of the theoretical. Roland neither views technological determinism as completely dominant over history nor completely absent as well; in accordance with the above criterion of technological determinist structure, would Roland be classified as a "soft determinist".

==Notable technological determinists ==

[[Thomas L. Friedman]], American journalist, columnist and author, admits to being a technological determinist in his book ''The World is Flat''.

Futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]]'s theories about a [[technological singularity]] follow a technologically deterministic view of history.

Some interpret Karl Marx as advocating technological determinism, with such statements as "The Handmill gives you society with the feudal lord: the [[steam-mill]], society with the industrial capitalist" (''The Poverty of Philosophy,'' 1847), but others argue that Marx was not a determinist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html Technological or Media Determinism], Daniel Chandler&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological determinist Walter Ong reviews the societal transition from an oral culture to a written culture in his work "Orality and Literacy." He asserts that this particular development is attributable to the use of new technologies of literacy (particularly print and writing,) to communicate thoughts which could previously only be verbalized. He furthers this  argument by claiming that writing is purely context dependent as it is a "secondary modelling system" (8). Reliant upon the earlier primary system of spoken language, writing manipulates the potential of language as it depends purely upon the visual sense to communicate the intended information. Furthermore, the rather stagnant technology of literacy distinctly limits the usage and influence of knowledge, it unquestionably effects the evolution of society. In fact, Ong asserts that "more than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness" (Ong 1982: 78).

== Media determinism as a form of technological determinism ==

Media determinism is a form of technological determinism, a philosophical and sociological position which posits the power of the media to impact society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/define.html ''Media Determinism in Cyberspace''], Regent University&lt;/ref&gt; Two foundational media determinists are the Canadian scholars [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. One of the best examples of technological determinism in media theory is Marshall McLuhan's theory "[[the medium is the message]]" and the ideas of his mentor Harold Adams Innis. Both these Canadian theorists saw media as the essence of civilization. The association of different media with particular mental consequences by McLuhan and others can be seen as related to technological determinism. It is this variety of determinism that is referred to as media determinism. According to McLuhan, there is an association between communications media/technology and language; similarly, [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argues that language shapes our perception of thinking ([[linguistic determinism]]). For McLuhan, media is a more powerful and explicit determinant than is the more general concept of language. McLuhan was not necessarily a hard determinist. As a more moderate version of media determinism, he proposed that our use of particular media may have subtle influences on us, but more importantly, it is the social context of use that is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf |last=McLuhan|first=Marshall | title=Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324065603/http://beforebefore.net/80f/s11/media/mcluhan.pdf|archivedate= March 24, 2012|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Media ecology]].
Media determinism is a form of the popular dominant theory of the relationship between [[technology and society]]. In a determinist view, technology takes on an active life of its own and is seen be as a driver of social phenomena. Innis believed that the social, cultural, political, and economic developments of each historical period can be related directly to the technology of the means of mass communication of that period. In this sense, like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, technology itself appears to be alive, or at least capable of shaping human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1789051 |last=Hist|first=Martin |title= One tweet does not a revolution make: Technological determinism, media and social change|publisher= Deakin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been increasingly subject to critical review by scholars. For example, scholar [[Raymond Williams]], criticizes media determinism and rather believes social movements define technological and media processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams|first=Raymond |title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXSLD8j0kb8C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Determination+is+a+real+social+process,+but+never#v=onepage&amp;q=Determination%20is%20a%20real%20social%20process%2C%20but%20never&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 May 2013 |year=1974 |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |isbn=978-0-415-31456-5 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to communications media, audience determinism is a viewpoint opposed to media determinism. This is described as instead of media being presented as doing things to people; the stress is on the way people do things with media. Individuals need to be aware that the term "deterministic" is a negative one for many social scientists and modern sociologists; in particular they often use the word as a term of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html |last=Chandler| first= Daniel | title=Technological or Media Determinism |date=18 September 1995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235047/http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tecdet.html|archivedate=April 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===
The Russian economist Kondratiev&lt;ref&gt;Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23422">'''Technological utopianism''' (often called '''techno-utopianism''' or '''technoutopianism''') is any [[ideology]] based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a [[utopia]], or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A '''techno-utopia''' is therefore an ideal [[society]], in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-[[future]], as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, [[post-scarcity]], [[Trans-human|transformations in human nature]], the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the [[immortality|end of death]].

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as [[technological determinism]] or [[Media imaginary|media imaginaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Balbi|first2=Gabriele|date=2014-04-03|title=Media and the Imaginary in History|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|journal=Media History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–218|doi=10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|issn=1368-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a leading theorist on [[technology]] and [[cyberculture]] claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” &lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. “Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance.” Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance. Web. 02 March 2015. http://www.rushkoff.com/articles-individual/2008/3/31/21st-century-renaissance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause,&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Howard P. Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and The American Future, "The Technological Utopians", Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture, the [[Californian Ideology]], [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title = Rediscovering Utopia | year=  2003 | url = http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx  | accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204653/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2007-09-27 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[singularitarianism]], have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic [[Imre Szeman]] argues technological utopianism is an irrational [[metanarrative|social narrative]] because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which [[Modernity|modern]] societies place faith in [[Idea of Progress|narratives of progress and technology]] overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=People Generally Do Not Act on Information on the Effects of Oil on the Environment |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100528150833.htm |work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

[[Karl Marx]] believed that [[science]] and [[democracy]] were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century [[Classical liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Republicanism|republicans]] often embraced techno-utopianism. [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] like [[Joseph Priestley]] pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in the early 19th century inspired [[Communalism|communalists]] with their visions of a future scientific and [[technological evolution]] of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] to validate the idea of [[social progress]]. [[Edward Bellamy]]’s [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]] in ''[[Looking Backward]]'', which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century [[United States]] and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Socialist]]s, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. [[Marxism|Marxists]] argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with [[Mutualism (economic theory)|different property relations]], but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for [[Empowerment|empowered]] [[proletarian]]s was "to increase the total [[productive forces]] as rapidly as possible". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from [[Social democracy|social democrats]] to [[Communism|communists]], were focused on [[industrialization]], [[economic development]] and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Some technological utopians promoted [[eugenics]]. Holding that in studies of families, such as the [[The Jukes family|Jukes]] and [[Kallikaks]], science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Mark ''Eugenics: Hereditarian attitudes in American thought'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.G. Wells]] in works such as ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' promoted technological utopianism.

The horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The [[Holocaust]], as [[Theodor Adorno]] underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of [[Condorcet]] and other thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which commonly equated [[scientific progress]] with social progress.&lt;ref name="Adorno1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Theodor W.|title=Prisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=29 March 1983|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51025-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[Californian Ideology]] was a set of beliefs combining [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with techno-utopianism and support for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the "bible" of its adherents.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Borsook, Paulina|authorlink = Paulina Borsook|title = Cyberselfishness|year = 1996|url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|accessdate = 2007-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125249/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|archivedate = 2007-09-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author = Borsook, Paulina|title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech| publisher = PublicAffairs|year = 2000|isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy |title = The California Ideology|year = 2000 |url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the [[Internet]] was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. "Self-empowered knowledge workers" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an "obsolete remnant of the [[industrial age]]".&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

Similar forms of "digital utopianism" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or more broadly to [[new media]] as harbingers of political and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Ballatore|first2=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=105–121|doi=10.1177/0163443713511902|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents claim it transcended conventional "[[Left–right politics|right/left]]" distinctions in [[politics]] by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a [[Economic liberalism|hostility toward government regulation]] and a belief in the superiority of the [[free market]] system. Prominent "[[oracles]]" of techno-utopianism included [[George Gilder]] and [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], an editor of ''Wired'' who also published several books.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the [[Dot-com bubble|speculative bubble]] gave rise to claims that an era of "permanent prosperity" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet [[Startup company|startups]] and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent [[Stock market crash|crash]], many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, [[technorealism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] are stances that have risen among advocates of [[technological change]] as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technorealism|url=http://technorealism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/06/technoprogressivism-beyond.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several [[Technical journalism|technical journalists]] and social commentators, such as [[Mark Pesce]], have interpreted the [[WikiLeaks]] phenomenon and the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian [[Freedom of information laws by country|transparent society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42148.html |title=The state, the press and a hyperdemocracy |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mark Pesce |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyber-utopianism]], first coined by [[Evgeny Morozov]], is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]].

Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:&lt;ref name="Gendron 1977"&gt;{{cite book|    author = Gendron, Bernard|     title = Technology and the Human Condition| publisher = St.Martin's Press|      year = 1977|        isbn = 0-312-78890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#We are presently undergoing a ([[post-industrial]]) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, [[technological change|technological growth]] will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the [[post scarcity|end of economic scarcity]];
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major [[social issues|social evil]].

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature''', fostering “communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.''' Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#'''Technology democratizes society.''' The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created “the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#'''Technology inevitably progresses.''' The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV [[remote control]], video game [[joystick]], [[computer mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] allowed for much more progress.
#'''Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive.''' As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its “social side effect… [became] its main feature.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#'''Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice.''' The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#'''New technology can solve the problems created by old technology.''' Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of [[dot.com bubble]] businesses’ attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==

Critics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of [[social progress]] with [[scientific progress]] is a form of [[positivism]] and [[scientism]]. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on "government interference" while dismissing the positive effects of the [[regulation]] of [[business]]. They also point out that it has little to say about the [[Technology#Environmental|environmental impact of technology]]&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see [[global digital divide]]).&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In his 2010 study ''System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster'', [[Canada Research Chair]]holder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the [[environmental issues with petroleum|effects of oil on the environment]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;

In a controversial article "Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality", [[Wall Street Journal]] explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576506393735675856.html#articleTabs%3Darticle|title= Techno-Utopians Are Mugged by Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], ”Technological Dependency and Loss of Freedom”, pp. 245, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

Even today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler &amp; Proctor II|first=Ronald B. &amp; Russell F.|title=Looking Out Looking In|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cenage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-79621-3|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication.  These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues.  The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by [[videotelephony|video]] and [[augmented reality]] versions of digital communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/augmented-reality-in-technical-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7742">A '''tectonic weapon''' is a hypothetical device or system which could create [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es, or other seismic events in specified locations by interfering with the Earth's natural geological processes. It was defined in 1992 by Aleksey Vsevolovidich Nikolayev, corresponding member [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]: "A tectonic or seismic weapon would be the use of the accumulated tectonic energy of the Earth's deeper layers to induce a destructive earthquake".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA335648&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf 927N0104A Moscow ZNANIYE-Sila (in Russian) No. 1, Jan 92 p2-13, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology,  October 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; He added "to set oneself the objective of inducing an earthquake is extremely doubtful".

== Concept ==
Theoretically, the tectonic weapon functions by creating a powerful charge of [[elastic energy]] in the form of deformed volume of the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] in a region of tectonic activity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Disasters - Volume I|last=Kotlyakov|first=Valdimir|publisher=UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers|year=2010|isbn=9781848267596|location=Singapore|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This then becomes an earthquake once triggered by a nuclear explosion in the epicenter or a vast electric pulse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As to the question of whether a nuclear explosion can trigger an earthquake, there was the analysis of local seismic recordings within a couple of miles of nuclear tests in the 1960s at Nevada that showed nuclear explosions caused some tectonic stress.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-nuclear-explosions-cause-earthquakes?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products|title=Can nuclear explosions cause earthquakes?|website=www.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account provided by a member of the Nevada Commission on Nuclear Projects, also claimed that a 1968 underground nuclear test called Faultless successfully induced an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weather Warfare|last=Smith|first=Jerry|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2006|isbn=9781931882606|location=Kempton, IL|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] stated that it produced fresh fault rupture some 1200 meters long.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a theory that 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan was triggered by thermonuclear tests conducted in Indian and Pakistani test sites 2-20 days prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Remote Sensing Technology for Tsunami Modelling and Forecasting|last=Marghany|first=Maged|publisher=CRC Press|year=2018|isbn=9780815386391|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=4-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Reports==
Roger Clark, lecturer in [[geophysics]] at [[Leeds University]] said in the respected journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 1996, responding to a newspaper report that there had been two secret Soviet programs, "Mercury" and "Volcano", aimed at developing a "tectonic weapon" that could set off earthquakes from great distance by manipulating electromagnetism, said "We don't think it is impossible, or wrong, but past experience suggests it is very unlikely". According to Nature these programs had been "unofficially known to Western geophysicists for several years". According to the story the Mercury program began in 1987, three tests were conducted in Kyrgyzstan, and Volcano's last test occurred in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=owwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=1zWNmzxDII&amp;dq=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tectonic%20weapon%22%20-haiti&amp;f=false R Clark, Nature, 10 October 1996, quoted in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Jan 1997, In Brief section]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such weapons, whether or not they exist or are feasible, are a source of concern in official circles. For example, US [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen|William S. Cohen]], said on 28 April 1997 at the Conference on Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy, [[University of Georgia]], while discussing the dangers of false threats, "Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/news/usa/1997/04/bmd970429d.htm  Federation of American Scientists]: Address by US Secretary of State at 1997 conference on terrorism&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's unsuccessful [[Project Seal]] programme during [[World War II]] attempted to create [[tsunami]] waves as a weapon. It was reported in 1999 that such a weapon might be viable.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_14884"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=14884 |title=Devastating tsunami bomb viable, say experts |author=Bingham, Eugene |date=28 September 1999 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed a small steam-powered [[Tesla's oscillator|mechanical oscillator]] he was experimenting with in 1898 produced earthquake-like effects, but this has never been replicated. The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' in [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Episode 60 .E2.80.93 .22Earthquake Machine.22|Episode 60 .E2.80.93]] made a small machine based on the same principle but powered by electricity rather than steam; it produced vibrations in a large structure detectable 100&amp;nbsp;feet away, but no significant shaking, and they judged the effect to be a busted myth.

==International treaties==
The 1978 [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]] is an international treaty ratified by 75 states, and signed by a further 17, that prohibits use of environmental modification techniques to cause earthquakes and [[tsunami]]s, amongst other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm US State Department: Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
After natural tectonic phenomena such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], [[conspiracy theories]], usually relating to the [[armed forces]] of the [[United States]] and formerly the [[Soviet Union]], often arise, though no [[evidence]] is advanced. After the Haiti earthquake it was widely reported that president [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]] made unsupported allegations that it had been caused by testing of a US tectonic weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/hugo-chavez-haiti-earthquake-tetonic-weapon-100129.html LiveScience: Chavez: US 'Tectonic Weapon' Caused Haiti Quake, 29 January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] of [[Moscow]] reported on page 1 on 30 May 1992 that "a geophysical or tectonic weapon was actually developed in the [[USSR]] despite the UN Convention", but  that Chief Seismologist Major-General V Bochrov of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|USSR Ministry of Defence]] categorically rejected any hints on the existence of tectonic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Komsomolskaya Pravda, 30 May 1992, p1, translated in JPRS Report on Science and Technology, 10 June 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
=="Earthquake bombs"==

While the British [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] and [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]] bombs of [[World War II]] were called ''[[earthquake bomb]]s'', the name came from their way of destroying very hardened targets by shaking their foundations as an earthquake would; they were never intended to cause an actual earthquake.

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg| thumb | alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[prescription drugs]] is a feature of '''telepharmacy'''.]]
'''Telepharmacy''' is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of [[telemedicine]], as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff | title = Telepharmacy Increases the Safety of Chemotherapy Preparation | journal = [[US Pharmacist]] | date = 19 November 2007 | volume = 32 | number = 11 | page = 73 | url = http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/10195/?t=men's_health,chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist.

The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of [[telemedicine]]: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friesner | first = Daniel L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = David M. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Charles D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = Howard C. | title = Do remote community telepharmacies have higher medication error rates than traditional community pharmacies?

==Implementation==
The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation.

===Australia===
A form of telepharmacy has been in use by [[Australia]]'s [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a [[telehealth]] consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, [[Queensland]] recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesic]]s and [[gastrointestinal medication]]s. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rural Remote Health |year=2008 |issue=Apr-Jun |volume=8 |page=937 |title=Tele-pharmacy in remote medical practice: the Royal Flying Doctor Service Medical Chest Program |last1=Margolis |first1=S. A. |last2=Ypinazar |first2=V. A. |pmid=18489239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_commentary.pdf |title=Telepharmacy — opportunity or threat? |first=James |last=Davies |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/KimberPetersonTelepharmacy.pdf |title=Telepharmacy—Enabling Technology to Provide Quality Pharmacy Services in Rural and Remote Communities |first1=
Michael B |last1=Kimber |first2=Gregory M |last2=Peterson |journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research |volume=36 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including [[Medicare Part D|changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Radford | first = Andrea | last2 = Slifkin | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Fraser | first3 = Roslyn | last4 = Mason | first4 = Michelle | last5 = Mueller | first5 = Keith | title = The Experience of Sole Community Rural Independent Pharmacies with Medicare Part D: Reports from the Field | journal = Policy Paper P2006-3 | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/rural/pubs/report/WP87.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007&amp;ndash;8]], led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boyle | first = Kaitlin | last2 = Ullrich | first2 = Fred | last3 = Mueller | first3 = Keith | title = Independently owned pharmacy closures in rural America, 2003&amp;ndash;2010 | journal = Rural Policy Brief | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/rupri/publications/policybriefs/2011/Independent%20Pharmacies.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full-time pharmacist, several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[northwestern United States|northwestern]] states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy.

In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/telepharmacy/ | publisher = North Dakota State University | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site [[pharmacy technician]]s and patients through [[videoconferencing]]. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Charles D. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Howard C., Jr | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: Restoring and retaining pharmacy services in rural communities | journal = Journal of Pharmacy Technology | year = 2004 | volume = 20 | pages = 28–39 | url = http://www.jpharmtechnol.com/abstracts/volume20/January-February/28.html | doi=10.1177/875512250402000107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khan | first = Shamima | last2 = Snyder | first2 = Herbert W. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Scott | first4 = David M. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Charles D. | title = Is there a successful business case for telepharmacy? | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | publisher = [[American Telemedicine Association]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | number = 3 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2007.0045 | pmid=18570546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolpack | first = Dave | title = Telepharmacy project expands across country | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 12 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-12-virtual-pharmacy_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of [[community health centers]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by [[videoconferencing]]. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clifton | first = G.

The [[Alaska Native Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], providing telehealth services to [[Alaska Native]] populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/Awards/AwardforExcellenceinMedicationUseSafety/2006AwardsRecipients.aspx | title = 2006 Awards Recipients | publisher = ASHP Foundation | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at [[Naval Hospital Pensacola]] in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Traynor | first = Kate | title = Navy takes Telepharmacy Worldwide | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1134–1136 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/14/1134.full | doi = 10.2146/news100051 | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telehealth Advancement Act | publisher = Center for Connected Health Policy, California | url = http://cchpca.org/telehealth-advancement-act | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]]'s first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Vanessa | title = Telepharmacy could save rural Iowa sites | newspaper = [[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] | location = Cedar Rapids, Iowa | date = 18 October 2012 | url = http://thegazette.com/2012/10/18/pharmacy-draft/ | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of the various American states' [[rural health]] offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Casey1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Sorensen | first2 = Todd D. | last3 = Elias | first3 = Walter | last4 = Knudson | first4 = Alana | last5 = Gregg | first5 = Walter | title = Current practices and state regulations regarding telepharmacy in rural hospitals | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1085-1092 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/13/1085.abstract | doi = 10.2146/ajhp090531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved ([[internet access]], [[Data compression|audio/video compression]] algorithms, [[microphones]] and [[video cameras]]), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Stephania H. | title = What's holding up the telemedicine explosion? | journal = Connected Planet | date = 1 June 1998 | url = http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_whats_holding_telemedicine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings.&lt;ref name="Casey1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Elias | first2 = Walter | last3 = Knudson | first3 = Alana | last4 = Gregg | first4 = Walter | title = Implementation of Telepharmacy in Rural Hospitals: Potential for Improving Medication Safety | journal = Final Report #8 | publisher = Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center | year = 2008 | url = https://www.nodakpharmacy.com/pdfs/UMRHfirstDose.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to [[Protected health information|protect patient medical information]] in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Rathke | first = Ann | title = North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: An Update | booktitle = North Dakota Pharmacist Association Convention | date = 23–25 April 2010 | location = Minot, North Dakota | publisher = NDTP | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/NDTP_PPt__Update.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Adoption of telepharmacy in [[Canada]] began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation.&lt;ref name=CADTH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadth.ca/products/environmental-scanning/health-technology-update/issue2/telepharmacy |title=Virtual pharmacists provide long-distance care |journal=Health Technology Update |issue=2 |date=January 2006 |publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote dispensing]] machines for medication began operation in [[Ontario]], Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes.&lt;ref name="BJCP"/&gt; As of 2009, a hospital in [[Ontario]], Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ross Memorial Hospital, Lindsay, Ontario | journal = Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy | date = September–October 2009 | volume = 62 | number = 5 | page = 424 | pmc=2830020 | pmid=22478928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the [[United Kingdom]] beginning in 2010.&lt;ref name="BJCP"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_news_feature.pdf| title=Remote dispensing machines to be tested in UK hospitals |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in [[Bahrain]], [[Belgium]], [[Cuba]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/blog-post/bizstream/2013-04-24/maxor-expands-puerto-rico-operations |title=Maxor expands Puerto Rico operations |author=Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corp. |date=April 25, 2013 |type=press release |work=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Mannings]] drugstores became the first in [[Hong Kong]] to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tele-Pharmacy on Show at Mannings Stores in Hong Kong | journal = Thistle: The Magazine of [[Jardine Matheson]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | page = 8 | url = http://www.jardines.com/assets/files/NewsAndEvents/thistle/10_vol3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2645">The '''Universal Data Element Framework''' ('''UDEF''') was &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/udefinfo/index.htm The UDEF is being superseded by the Open Data Element Framework (O-DEF). ... These pages are maintained to provide access to legacy UDEF.]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[controlled vocabulary]] developed by [[The Open Group]]. It provided a framework for categorizing, naming, and indexing data. It assigned to every item of data a structured alphanumeric tag plus a controlled vocabulary name that describes the meaning of the data. This allowed relating data elements to similar elements defined by other organizations.

UDEF defined a [[Dewey Decimal Classification|dewey-decimal]] like code for each concept. For example, an "employee number" is often used in [[human resource management]]. It has a UDEF tag a.5_12.35.8 and a controlled vocabulary description "Employee.PERSON_Employer.Assigned.IDENTIFIER". 

==Examples==


In an application used by a hospital, the last name and first name of several people could include the following example concepts:

*Patient Person Family Name – find the word “Patient” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Family” under the UDEF property “Name”
*Patient Person Given Name – find the word “Patient” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Given” under the UDEF property “Name”
*Doctor Person Family Name – find the word “Doctor” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Family” under the UDEF property “Name”
*Doctor Person Given Name – find the word “Doctor” under the UDEF object “Person” and find the word “Given” under the UDEF property “Name”

For the examples above, the following UDEF IDs are available:

*“Patient Person Family Name” the UDEF ID is “au.5_11.10”
*“Patient Person Given Name” the UDEF ID is “au.5_12.10”
*“Doctor Person Family Name” the UDEF ID is “aq.5_11.10”

The '''White–Juday warp-field interferometer''' is an [[Warp-field experiments|experiment]] designed to detect a microscopic instance of a warping of [[spacetime]].  If such a warp is detected, it is hoped that more research into creating an [[Alcubierre drive#Alcubierre metric|Alcubierre warp bubble]] will be inspired. A research team led by [[Harold G. White|Harold "Sonny" White]] in collaboration with Dr. Richard Juday&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-juday-a396188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/warp-factor?page=0%2C2 Warp Factor&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA Johnson Space Center]] and [[Dakota State University]] are conducting experiments, but results so far have been inconclusive.

==Motivation for the experiment==
The NASA research team led by Harold White and their university partners currently aim to experimentally evaluate several concepts, especially a redesigned energy-density topology, as well as an implication of [[brane cosmology]] theory. If space actually were to be embedded in higher dimensions, the energy requirements could be decreased dramatically and a comparatively small energy density could already lead to a measurable (i.e. using an interferometer) curvature of spacetime.&lt;ref name="WFM 102"/&gt; The theoretical framework for the experiment dates back to work by Harold White from 2003, as well as work by White and Eric W. Davis from 2006 that was published in the [[American Institute of Physics|AIP]], where they also consider how [[baryon]]ic matter could, at least mathematically, adopt characteristics of [[dark energy]] (see section below). In the process, they described how a toroidal positive energy density may result in a spherical negative-pressure region, possibly eliminating the need for actual [[exotic matter]].&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;

==Theoretical framework==
{{main|Warp-field experiments#Theoretical framework}}
The metric derived by [[Alcubierre drive|Alcubierre]] was mathematically motivated by [[cosmological inflation]].

==Interferometer experiment==
[[File:Dr. Harold “Sonny” White at the interferometer.png|thumb|right|Harold White at the warp-field interferometer]]
The original device proposed by White after finding the energy-decreasing possibilities (see [[Warp-field experiments#Theoretical framework|theoretical framework]]) is a modified [[Michelson interferometer]] that uses a λ = 633&amp;nbsp;nm beam from a [[helium–neon laser]]. The beam is split into two paths, with the space-warping device placed in or near one beam path. The space warp would induce a relative phase shift between the split beams that should be detectable, provided that the magnitude of the phase shift created by the change in apparent path length is sufficient. By using 2D analytic signal processing, the magnitude and phase of the field can be extracted for study and comparison to theoretical models. The researchers first tried to see whether the space warping by the [[electric field|electric-field]] energy of a high-voltage (up to 20&amp;nbsp;kV) ring (0.5&amp;nbsp;cm radius) of [[High-k dielectric|high-κ]] [[barium titanate]] ceramic [[capacitor]]s could be detected. After the first tests the experiment was moved to a seismically isolated lab due to very high interference caused by people walking outside the room. The goals circa 2013 were to increase sensitivity up to 1/100 of a wavelength and implement the oscillating field in order to get definite results.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White101"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Harold “Sonny” White|title=Warp Field Mechanics 101|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936_2011016932.pdf|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|date=2011-09-30|accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmag2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Harold “Sonny” White|author2=Paul March|author3=Nehemiah Williams|author4=William O’Neill|last-author-amp=yes|title=Eagleworks Laboratories: Advanced Propulsion Physics Research|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110023492_2011024705.pdf|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|date=12 May 2011|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontiers&gt;{{cite book|author=Marc G.

===Results===
White announced the first results of his interferometer experiment at a 2013 space conference. According to White, these results showed a vanishing but non-zero difference between charged and uncharged states after signal processing, but this difference remains inconclusive due to external interference and limits in the computational processing.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Harold|title=Warp Field Physics|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140000851.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now clear that no exotic matter is involved in such an experiment, but some other concept is being used.&lt;ref name="AMES"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[Harold G.

==Interferometer experiment with a resonant cavity==
[[File:2015 NASA-JSC Eagleworks Warp-field Interferometer Test Set Up.jpg|thumb|Eagleworks warp-field interferometer test setup]]
During the first two weeks of April 2015, scientists fired lasers through a [[microwave cavity]] and noticed highly significant variations in the path time. The readings indicated that some of the laser pulses traveled longer, possibly pointing to a slight warp bubble inside the resonance chamber of the device.  However, a small rise in ambient air temperature inside the chamber was also recorded, which could possibly have caused the recorded fluctuation in speeds of the laser pulses. According to Paul March, a NASA JSC researcher, the experiment was to be verified inside a vacuum chamber to remove all interference of air. This was done at the end of April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=36313.msg1361931#msg1361931 Re: EM Drive Developments - related to space flight applications - Thread 2 - msg1361931].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-tests-physics-defying-method-of-space-travel-em-drive/#!|title=Is NASA one step closer to warp drive?]&lt;/ref&gt; White does not think, however, that the measured change in path length is due to transient air heating, because the visibility threshold is 40 times larger than the predicted effect from air.

The experiment used a short, cylindrical, aluminum resonant cavity (and not a tapered resonant cavity or [[RF resonant cavity thruster|EmDrive]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=36313.msg1361845#msg1361845 Re: EM Drive Developments - related to space flight applications - Thread 2 - msg1361845].&lt;/ref&gt; excited at a natural frequency of 1.48&amp;nbsp;GHz with an input power of 30 watts, over 27000 cycles of data (each 1.5 s cycle energizing the system for 0.75 s and de-energizing it for 0.75 s), which were averaged to obtain a power spectrum that revealed a signal frequency of 0.65&amp;nbsp;Hz with amplitude clearly above system noise.  Four additional tests were successfully conducted that demonstrated repeatability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/ Evaluating NASA’s Futuristic EM Drive].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warp-drive research and potential for interstellar propulsion==
The NASA research team has postulated that their findings could reduce the energy requirements for a spaceship moving at ten times the speed of light ("warp 2") from the mass–energy equivalent of the planet [[Jupiter]] to that of the [[Voyager 1]] spacecraft (~700&amp;nbsp;kg)&lt;ref name="WFM 102"&gt;{{cite web|author=White, Harold|title=Warp Field Mechanics 102: Energy Optimization|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20130011213|publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center|date=January 2013|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or less.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;

By harnessing the physics of cosmic inflation, future spaceships crafted to satisfy the laws of these mathematical equations might actually be able to get somewhere unthinkably fast and without adverse effects.&lt;ref name="Roundup" /&gt;

Physicist and EarthTech CEO [[Harold E. Puthoff]] has explained that, contrary to widespread belief, even the highly [[Blue shift|blue-shifted]] light seen on board such a spaceship would not fry its crew, being bathed in strong [[Ultraviolet light|UV]] light and [[X-ray]]s. It would, however, be dangerous to anyone seeing it fly by closely.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;

Research on this device and other proposed devices is notable as the original newsletter from the NASA center&lt;ref name="Roundup" /&gt; and later presentations at a NASA conference&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt; detailed NASA funding of research in advanced concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/88010/niac-is-back-nasa-funds-30-innovative-ideas-that-just-might-work/ |title=NIAC is Back: NASA Funds 30 Innovative Ideas that Just Might Work |work=[[Universe Today]] |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/innovation_fund/index.html Center Innovation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ep.jpl.nasa.gov/ Electric Propulsion]&lt;/ref&gt; and in this particular case in the work proposed by [[Miguel Alcubierre]], physical effects that have potential applications to space travel. In addition, these news releases included the researchers' enthusiastic descriptions of the potentials with statements such as: ''"... while this would be a very modest instantiation of the phenomenon, it would likely be a [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago pile]] moment for this area of research..."'' Several space technology newsletters&lt;ref name=WDmorefeasible /&gt; and space society organizations have further publicized these claims.&lt;ref name=io9 /&gt; [[Keith Cowing]] of the blog [[NASA Watch]] questions the oversight of this line of research by NASA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA Watch|author=Keith Cowing|title=Warp Drive Research at NASA JSC|url=http://nasawatch.com/archives/2012/09/warp-drive-rese.html|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requested an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA Watch|author=Keith Cowing|title=Clarifying NASA's Warp Drive Program|url=http://spaceref.com/nasa-hack-space/propulsion/clarifying-nasas-warp-drive-program.html|date=April 12, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journalist says that although a practical warp drive is a long way off, serious efforts to learn more about it are being undertaken now.&lt;ref name="Gizmag2012"/&gt; At the second [[100 Year Starship]] Symposium, [[Harold Sonny White (NASA Scientist)|White]] told  Space.com, "We're trying to see if we can generate a very tiny instance of this in a tabletop experiment", the project is a "humble experiment" but said it represents a promising first step: "The findings I presented today change it from impractical to plausible and worth further investigation."&lt;ref name="WDmorefeasible" /&gt;
