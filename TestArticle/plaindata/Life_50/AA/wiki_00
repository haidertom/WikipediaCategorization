{"id": "32952970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32952970", "title": "3D Virtual Creature Evolution", "text": "3D Virtual Creature Evolution\n\n3D Virtual Creature Evolution, abbreviated to 3DVCE, is an artificial evolution simulation program created by Lee Graham. The website is currently down. Its purpose is to visualize and research common themes in body plans and strategies to achieve a fitness function of the artificial organisms generated and maintained by the system in their given environment. The program was inspired by Karl Sims’ 1994 artificial evolution program, Evolved Virtual Creatures. The program is run through volunteers who download the program from the home website and return information from completed simulations. It is currently only available on Windows and in some cases Linux.\n\n3DVCE uses evolutionary algorithms to simulate evolution. The user sets the body plan restrictions (maximum number of segment types, branching segments’ length and depth limits, and size limits) and whether fitness score is scaled in relation to size. Limb interpenetration is also an option. Reproduction / population settings include the size of each population and their run time (how long each individual has to attain a fitness score), percentage of individuals who get to reproduce (tournament size), what percentage sexually or asexually reproduce, and selection type is then determined. Crossover rate determines what percentage of an individual is created via crossover of parents and mutation. Mutation rate in body and brain is then determined. Specific mathematical operations and values can be attributed to the creature’s brain as well.\n\nFitness function is then determined. Artificial organisms’ fitness score is determined by how well they achieve their fitness goal within their evaluation time. Fitness functions include distance traveled, maximum height, average height, “TOG” (determined by amount of time creature is in contact with ground), and “Sphere” (determined by creature’s ability to catch and hold spheres). These goals are not individualized and can be set to specific strengths (from zero, as not having an influence on fitness, to one, or having maximum influence) to determine the fitness goal. What generations the fitness function applies to can also be set. The environment, or “Terrain”, is then determined. This includes a flat plain, bumpy terrain (in which a hill is generated around creature that constantly inclines as distance is traveled from the creature’s spawning point), water (a low gravity simulator, non-functional), and “spheres” (spheres are generated above creature to catch).\n\nEverything in the simulation is viewed from a first person viewpoint. After settings are determined, the first generation is generated from randomly created individuals. All creatures appear at the same spawning point and are made of segments or rectangular prisms connected to others at joints. Colors are assigned to segment types randomly. Segment type is determined by the size and joints a segment has. Colors indicate nothing else than that. These first generation creatures move randomly, with no influence from the fitness goal. Creatures with the largest fitness value reproduce and the following generation is based on this reproduction. Eventually, patterns in the population form and fitness increases even further. Fitness function can be changed during the simulation to simulate environmental changes and individual runs can be duplicated to simulate different lineages or speciation.\n\n3DVCE is not only for evolutionary research. Objects can also be spawned for graphics and simulated physics tests. This includes pre-installed blocks, spheres, grenades, and structures that can either be thrown from camera or generated at a spawning point. Artificial gravity can also be manipulated. Random and archived creatures can also be re-spawned to manipulate or view. Lee Graham has also included a TARDIS in the simulation, which when moved into can teleport the camera back to the original spawning point.\n\nConvergent evolution occurs often in 3DVCE, as similar structures and behaviors of the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical \"wings\", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the air. Rolling Ribbons and Springs are very similar to the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.\n\nMany other types of creatures also form that do not necessarily fit the four main groups previously described by Lee Graham. Tall stick-like creatures also evolve to attain maximum height. Some users have been able to fix the water simulator to evolve creatures that swim. Many other creatures evolve that share traits of multiple groups. There are currently over 220 creatures archived on the main website, which can be found on YouTube by visiting the \"Creature Mann\" channel.\n"}

{"id": "985619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985619", "title": "Agent-based model", "text": "Agent-based model\n\nAn agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming. Monte Carlo methods are used to introduce randomness. Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called individual-based models (IBMs), and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including biology, ecology and social science. Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of multi-agent systems or multi-agent simulation in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.\n\nAgent-based models are a kind of microscale model that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of emergence from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as K.I.S.S. (\"Keep it simple, stupid\"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status, using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience \"learning\", adaptation, and reproduction.\n\nMost agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as computer simulations, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.\n\nThe idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.\n\nThe history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine, a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device von Neumann proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed cellular automata.\nAnother advance was introduced by the mathematician John Conway. He constructed the well-known Game of Life. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard.\n\nOne of the earliest agent-based models in concept was Thomas Schelling's segregation model, which was discussed in his paper \"Dynamic Models of Segregation\" in 1971. Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Robert Axelrod hosted a tournament of Prisoner's Dilemma strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner. Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from ethnocentrism to the dissemination of culture.\nBy the late 1980s, Craig Reynolds' work on flocking models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton.\n\nThe first use of the word \"agent\" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down. One candidate appears to be John Holland and John H. Miller's 1991 paper \"Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory\", based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.\n\nAt the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT). This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).\n\nWith the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, Swarm and NetLogo in the mid-1990s and RePast and AnyLogic in 2000, or GAMA in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew. Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time\n\nThe 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, Sugarscape, developed by\nJoshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture. Other notable 1990s developments included Carnegie Mellon University's Kathleen Carley ABM, to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.\nDuring this 1990s timeframe Nigel Gilbert published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the \"Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation\" (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal \"Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling\" (CASM).\n\nThrough the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks. CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling. Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history, and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form INFORMS, and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS). Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining National Science Foundation funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS. She was succeeded by David Sallach of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, and then by Michael Prietula of Emory University. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized. As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally. The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006. The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with George Mason University taking the lead role in local arrangements.\n\nMore recently, Ron Sun developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as cognitive social simulation. Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at UCLA have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making. Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field. In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from Columbia University and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding. While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.\n\nMost computational modeling research describes systems in equilibrium or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior. The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, emergence, and complexity.\n\nAgent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity. Typically agents are\nsituated in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in algorithmic form in computer programs. In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful. In ecological ABM (often referred to as \"individual-based models\" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be \"purposeful\" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).\nThe modeling process is best described as inductive. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.\n\nIn some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, power-law distributions in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.\n\nRather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.\n\nRecent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models. describe a framework consisting of four levels of developing models of complex adaptive systems described using several example multidisciplinary case studies:\nOther methods of describing agent-based models include code templates and text-based methods such as the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Design Details) protocol.\n\nThe role of the environment where agents live, both macro and micro, is also becoming an important factor in agent-based modelling and simulation work. Simple environment affords simple agents, but complex environments generates diversity of behaviour.\n\nAgent-based modeling has been used extensively in biology, including the analysis of the spread of epidemics, and the threat of biowarfare, biological applications including population dynamics, vegetation ecology, landscape diversity, the growth and decline of ancient civilizations, evolution of ethnocentric behavior, forced displacement/migration, language choice dynamics, cognitive modeling, and biomedical applications including modeling 3D breast tissue formation/morphogenesis, the effects of ionizing radiation on mammary stem cell subpopulation dynamics, inflammation,\nand the human immune system. Agent-based models have also been used for developing decision support systems such as for breast cancer. Agent-based models are increasingly being used to model pharmacological systems in early stage and pre-clinical research to aid in drug development and gain insights into biological systems that would not be possible \"a priori\". Military applications have also been evaluated. Moreover, agent-based models have been recently employed to study molecular-level biological systems.\n\nAgent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include the modeling of organizational behaviour and cognition, team working, supply chain optimization and logistics, modeling of consumer behavior, including word of mouth, social network effects, distributed computing, workforce management, and portfolio management. They have also been used to analyze traffic congestion.\n\nRecently, agent based modelling and simulation has been applied to various domains such as studying the impact of publication venues by researchers in the computer science domain (journals versus conferences). In addition, ABMs have been used to simulate information delivery in ambient assisted environments. A November 2016 article in arXiv analyzed an agent based simulation of posts spread in the Facebook online social network. In the domain of peer-to-peer, ad-hoc and other self-organizing and complex networks, the usefulness of agent based modeling and simulation has been shown. The use of a computer science-based formal specification framework coupled with wireless sensor networks and an agent-based simulation has recently been demonstrated.\n\nAgent based evolutionary search or algorithm is a new research topic for solving complex optimization problems.\n\nPrior to, and in the wake of the financial crisis, interest has grown in ABMs as possible tools for economic analysis. ABMs do not assume the economy can achieve equilibrium and \"representative agents\" are replaced by agents with diverse, dynamic, and interdependent behavior including herding. ABMs take a \"bottom-up\" approach and can generate extremely complex and volatile simulated economies. ABMs can represent unstable systems with crashes and booms that develop out of non-linear (disproportionate) responses to proportionally small changes. A July 2010 article in \"The Economist\" looked at ABMs as alternatives to DSGE models. The journal \"Nature\" also encouraged agent-based modeling with an editorial that suggested ABMs can do a better job of representing financial markets and other economic complexities than standard models along with an essay by J. Doyne Farmer and Duncan Foley that argued ABMs could fulfill both the desires of Keynes to represent a complex economy and of Robert Lucas to construct models based on microfoundations. Farmer and Foley pointed to progress that has been made using ABMs to model parts of an economy, but argued for the creation of a very large model that incorporates low level models. By modeling a complex system of analysts based on three distinct behavioral profiles – imitating, anti-imitating, and indifferent – financial markets were simulated to high accuracy. Results showed a correlation between network morphology and the stock market index.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century ABMs have been deployed in architecture and urban planning to evaluate design and to simulate pedestrian flow in the urban environment. There is also a growing field of socio-economic analysis of infrastructure investment impact using ABM's ability to discern systemic impacts upon a socio-economic network.\n\nThe agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely \"Systems for Agents\" and \"Agents for Systems.\" Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).\n\nMany agent-based modeling software are designed for serial von-Neumann computer architectures. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units GPUs for ABM simulation. The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.\n\nVerification and validation (V&V) of simulation models is extremely important. Verification involves the model being debugged to ensure it works correctly, whereas validation ensures that the right model has been built. Face validation, sensitivity analysis, calibration and statistical validation have also been demonstrated. A discrete-event simulation framework approach for the validation of agent-based systems has been proposed. A comprehensive resource on empirical validation of agent-based models can be found here.\n\nAs an example of V&V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system), a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME (subject-matter expert). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.\n\nVOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:\n\nUnlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.\n\nDetails of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in. This thesis also gives details of \"exploratory agent-based modeling\", \"descriptive agent-based modeling\" and \"validated agent-based modeling\", using several worked case study examples.\n\nMathematical models of complex systems are of three types: black-box (phenomenological), white-box (mechanistic, based on the first principles) and grey-box (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).\n\n\n\n"}

Avida is under active development by Charles Ofria's Digital Evolution Lab at Michigan State University; the first version of Avida was designed in 1993 by Ofria, Chris Adami and C. Titus Brown at Caltech, and has been fully reengineered by Ofria on multiple occasions since then. The software was originally inspired by the Tierra system.\n\nTierra simulated an evolutionary system by introducing computer programs that competed for computer resources, specifically processor (CPU) time and access to main memory. In this respect it was similar to Core Wars, but differed in that the programs being run in the simulation were able to modify themselves, and thereby evolve. Tierra's programs were artificial life organisms.\n\nUnlike Tierra, Avida assigns every digital organism its own protected region of memory, and executes it with a separate virtual CPU. By default, other digital organisms cannot access this memory space, neither for reading nor for writing, and cannot execute code that is not in their own memory space.\n\nA second major difference is that the virtual CPUs of different organisms can run at different speeds, such that one organism executes, for example, twice as many instructions in the same time interval as another organism. The speed at which a virtual CPU runs is determined by a number of factors, but most importantly, by the \"tasks\" that the organism performs: logical computations that the organisms can carry out to reap extra CPU speed as bonus.\n\nAdami and Ofria, in collaboration with others, have used Avida to conduct research in digital evolution, and the scientific journals \"Nature\" and \"Science\" have published four of their papers.\n\nThe 2003 paper \"The Evolutionary Origin of Complex Features\" describes the evolution of a mathematical equals operation from simpler bitwise operations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27837389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27837389", "title": "Baopuzi", "text": "Baopuzi\n\nThe Baopuzi (), written by the Jin dynasty scholar Ge Hong 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric \"Neipian\" 內篇 \"Inner Chapters\" and exoteric \"Waipian\" 外篇 \"Outer Chapters\". The Daoist Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for \"xian\" 仙 \"immortality; transcendence\", Chinese alchemy, elixirs, and demonology. The Confucianist Outer Chapters discuss Chinese literature, Legalism, politics, and society.\n\nThe eponymous title \"Baopuzi\" derives from Ge Hong's \"hao\" 號 \"sobriquet; pseudonym\" Baopuzi (lit. \"embrace simplicity master\"), which compounds \"bao\" \"embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish\", \"pu\" or \"uncarved wood, [a Daoist metaphor for a] person's original nature; simple; plain\", and \"zi\" \"child; offspring; master [title of respect]\". \"Baopu\" is a classical allusion to the \"Daodejing\" (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), \"Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries.\"\n\nGe Hong's autobiography explains choosing his pen name Baopuzi.\nIt has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (\"Pao-p'u\"), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) \nCompare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) \"people all call me a \"pao-p'u\" scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)\"; (Sailey 1978:251) \"among the people of his district there were those who called him \"The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity\".\" Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, \"This name has been translated \"Old Sober-Sides\", but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated \"Solemn-Seeming Philosopher\".\" Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates \"Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature\".\n\nCompared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the \"Baopuzi\" are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when Emperor Yuan of Jin founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).\n\nGe Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the \"Baopuzi\".\nIn my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed \"Nei p'ien\" in 20 scrolls, \"Wai p'ien\" in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My \"Nei p'ien\", telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My \"Wai p'ien\", giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)\nCompare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), \"I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready.\"\n\nGe's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), Emperor Cheng of Jin granted Ge the fief of \"Marquis of Guanzhong\" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the \"Baopuzi\" during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" consists of 70 \"pian\" 篇 \"chapters; books\" divided between the 20 \"Inner Chapters\" and 50 \"Outer Chapters\" (cf. the \"Zhuangzi\" textual division). Nathan Sivin (1969:389) described it as \"not one book but two, considerably different in theme\". The \"Neipian\" and \"Waipian\" \"led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time\".\n\nThe (1444–1445) Ming Dynasty \"Daozang\" \"Daoist canon\" first printed the two \"Baopuzi\" parts together. This \"Zhengtong Daozang\" 正統道藏 \"Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (1436-1450)\" bibliographically categorized the \"Baopuzi\" under the \"Taiqing\" 太清 \"Supreme Clarity\" section for alchemical texts. \"Daozang\" editions encompass six \"juan\" (卷 \"scrolls; fascicles; volumes\"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of \"Baopuzi\" descend from this Ming \"Daozang\" text.\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from esotericism to social philosophy. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of \"xian\" 仙 \"immortality; transcendence\", Chinese alchemy, meditation, Daoist yoga, Daoyin, sexual techniques, Chinese herbology, demons, and \"fu\" 符 \"magic talismans\". The Outer Chapters discuss Chinese philosophy, Confucianism, Legalism, government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called \"the fullest document of this kind that early China produced\".\n\nAccording to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between Daoism and Confucianism. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the \"ben\" 本 \"root; trunk; origin\" and Confucianism as the \"mo\" 末 \"tip; branch; end\" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, \"Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?\" – Baopuzi replies, \"Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism.\"\n\nWhile the \"Baopuzi\" Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is \"Huowen yue\" 或問曰 \"Someone asked, saying\" and \"Baopuzi da yue\" 抱樸子答曰 \"Baopuzi answered, saying\".\n\nThe twenty \"Neipian\" \"Inner Chapters\" record arcane techniques for achieving \"xian\" \"transcendence; immortality\". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that Tang Dynasty scholars later differentiated into \"neidan\" 內丹 \"internal elixir; internal alchemy\" and \"waidan\" 外丹 \"external elixir; external alchemy\". The word \"dan\" \"cinnabar; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill\" means \"pill of immortality, or elixir of life. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. \"Internal alchemy\" concerns creating an \"immortal body\" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). \"External\" or \"laboratory alchemy\" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing \"fu\" talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.\n\nLai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:\n\nSeveral chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe \"waidan\" \"external alchemy\". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).\n\nMany scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. Joseph Needham (1954:437), who called Ge Hong \"the greatest alchemist in Chinese history\", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.\n\"Interlocutor\": Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. <br>\n\"Ko\": According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) \nNeedham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, \"Admittedly there is much in the \"Pao Phu Tzu\" which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce.\"\n\nIn addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention the \"Baopuzi\" formula for making mosaic gold \"a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment\" from \"chiyan\" 赤塩 \"red crystal salt\" (produced from amethyst, calcite crystal, and alum; Ware 1966:273) and \"huizhi\" 灰汁 \"limewater\".\nThe description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or \"mosaic gold\" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, \"tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of \"Ch'ih Yen\" (Red Salt) and \"Huei Chih\" (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of \"Ch'ih Yen\".\" They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). \"All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold.\" The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that \"twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used.\" (1935:232) \nThe authors add, \"It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make tin foil and that he made magic or spirit money out of it.\"\n\nThe fifty \"Waipian\" \"Outer Chapters\" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This \"Baopuzi\" portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of Luoyang.\n\nSome of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the \"Qingtan\" \"pure conversation\" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of Cao Cao; and Bao Jingyan 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.\n\nThe Chinese \"Baopuzi\" has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.\n\nThe Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the history of alchemy. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 \"On the Gold Medicine\" and 16 \"On the Yellow and White\" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 \"Overcoming Obstructions\" and 11 \"On \"hsien\" Medicines\", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).\n\nThe Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it \"at times misguided\". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). \"Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion.\"\n\nTranslating the fundamental Daoist word \"Dao\" or \"Tao\" \"way; path; principle\" as English \"God\" is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's \"Baopuzi\" version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of \"Daodejing\" 25, \"Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet \"Tao\" (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal.\" \nThen, upon noticing that \"Tao Te Ching\", verse 34, is willing to call the Something \"Minimal,\" every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by \"God\". In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from \"Exod\". 3:13-15 and \"Mark\" 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, \"My name is I am, I live, I exist,\" while the second reads, \"God is not of the dead but of the living.\" Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) \nWare admitted his \"God\" for \"Dao\" translation cannot be applied consistently.\nIt is clear that the word \"tao\" appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as \"the divine process.\" In instances where either this or \"God\" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term \"tao shih\" is rendered \"processor\"; \"hsien\" is translated \"genie\" rather than \"immortal\". (1966:3) \nThese Chinese words are \"daoshi\" \"Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner\" and \"xian\" \"immortal; transcendent\". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the History of science and technology in China, criticized Ware's mistranslations. \nIt may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that \"Genii,\" as used for rendering the word \"hsien\", does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the \"Thousand-and-One Nights\". The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. \"Tao\" left untranslated and \"immortal\" for \"hsien\". (1967:145) \nNevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. \"Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China.\"\n\nGe Hong wrote the \"Baopuzi\" in elegant Classical Chinese grammar and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing \"xian\" medicines illustrates the translational choices.\nThe best \"hsien\" medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, \"chih\", the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, \"t'ai i yü yü liang\", \"shih chung huang tzu\" 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), \"shih kuei\" 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, \"shih nao\" 石腦, \"shih liu huang\" 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and \"tseng ch'ing\". (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) \n\nMedicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many \"chih\", then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then \"ming-chu\", then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) \n\nAt the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) \n\nThe \"Baoppuzi\" Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on \"Buddhism and the \"Pao-p'u-tzu\"\", \"Biography of Ko Hung\" from the \"Jin Shu\", and \"Recensions\" of lost \"Baopuzi\" fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, \"Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture.\"\n\nFor centuries, traditional scholars have revered the \"Baopuzi\" as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.\n\nTraditional scholarship viewed the \"Baopuzi\", especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese \"waidan\" \"external alchemy\". Wu and Davis described it as, \nprobably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) \nArthur Waley praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.\nNowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 \"metal-lord\" and 河車 \"river chariot\", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 \"the virgin on the river\", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) \nIn the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the \"Baopuzi\" is a \"more important\" alchemical text than Wei Boyang's (ca. 142) \"Cantong qi\" 參同契 \"The Kinship of the Three\". The \"Baopuzi\" mentions a \"Neijing\" 內經 \"Inner Classic\" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's \"Cantong ji\".\n\nModern scholarship has taken another look at the \"Baopuzi\". Sivin demeans the text's significance.\nThe Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what \"fundamentalist Confucian\" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) \nSivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, \"an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector\", with Alan Watts. \"Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time.\" However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, \"This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate.\"\n\nChi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a \"new discourse\" on \"xian\"-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional \"imperial discourse\" that only the rich could afford \"xian\"-hood. For example, histories record that both Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the \"elixir of immortality\" from mythical Mount Penglai. \"That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful.\"\nAccording to Ko Hung, the \"hsien\"-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that \"hsien\"-immortality are distinctive \"human\" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of \"hsien\"-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, \"Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power.\"' Second, in placing the ideal of \"hsien\"-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were \"models\" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, \"These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao.\" (Lai 1998:210) \n\nGe Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces \"daoshi\" \"Daoist practitioners\" seeking \"xian\" techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.\nThen I asked further, \"Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes.\"\n\nSaid Cheng Chun in reply, \"The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But \"Tao-shih\" are all poor; witness the adage that \"Hsien\" are never stout and \"Tao-shih\" never rich. \"Tao-shih\" usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves\". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) \nWare (1966:268) translates this adage, \"There are no fat genii and no rich processors\".\n\nFor a wealthy person seeking \"xian\"-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding \"jinye\" 金液 (lit. \"gold liquid/fluid\") \"golden liquor\" in a \"huachi\" 花池 (lit. \"flower pond\") \"a vinegar solvent\" (fortified with saltpeter; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional \"jiuding\" 九鼎 \"nine tripods\" elixirs (attributed to the Yellow Emperor), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 cash.\nTrue it is that the nine medicines are the best of \"Hsien\" medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a \"Hua Ch'ih\" (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into \"Hsien\". Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr.

{"id": "15602282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15602282", "title": "Birthday effect", "text": "Birthday effect\n\nThe birthday effect (sometimes called the birthday blues, especially when referring specifically to suicide) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their birthday. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in England and Wales, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as in smaller populations such as Major League Baseball players. Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday, while others find no significant gender effect. Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased mortality salience, or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.\n\nWith the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on February 29, there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.\n\nA similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: heart attack and stroke (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths. Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%. An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women. Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players and people with entries in the \"Encyclopedia of American History\".\n\nFocusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in Denmark and Hungary, but not in Bavaria or Taiwan.\n\nHowever, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and Austria (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday. A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect. A small study by Leonard Zusne found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole. The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but it was not seen in the population as a whole.\n\nBirthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. Binge drinking can increase an individual's risk of death through alcohol poisoning, accidents and drunk driving, as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk. In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.\n\nTwo mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on psychosomatic effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life. According to the terror management theory, this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the public sphere of life (for example, career-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the private sphere (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on. Related is the \"broken promise effect\", whereby a person suffering suicidal ideation will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.\n\nThe psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as Christmas, and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a Passover effect among the Jewish community (which moves with the festival itself), and a Mid-Autumn Festival effect among the Chinese.\n\nIt has been suggested that, like the 24-hour circadian rhythm, the body also has a yearly \"circannual\" biological rhythm. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a zeitgeber that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.\n\nIt is possible when processing death certificates to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide. Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders. These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.\n"}

{"id": "23616040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23616040", "title": "Enantiopure drug", "text": "Enantiopure drug\n\nAn enantiopure drug is a pharmaceutical that is available in one specific enantiomeric form. Most biological molecules (proteins, sugars, etc.) are present in only one of many chiral forms, so different enantiomers of a chiral drug molecule bind differently (or not at all) to target receptors. One enantiomer of a drug may have a desired beneficial effect while the other may cause serious and undesired side effects, or sometimes even beneficial but entirely different effects.\nAdvances in industrial chemical processes have made it economical for pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed as a racemic mixture and market the individual enantiomers, either by specifically manufacturing the desired enantiomer or by resolving a racemic mixture. On a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed single enantiomers of certain drugs to be marketed under a different name than the racemic mixture. Also case-by-case, the United States Patent Office has granted patents for single enantiomers of certain drugs. The regulatory review for marketing approval (safety and efficacy) and for patenting (proprietary rights) is independent, and differs country by country.\n\n\"Selectivity\" is a very important part of organic synthesis. In scientific papers regarding synthesis, selectivity is often listed in data tables alongside percent yield and other reaction conditions. While selectivity is deemed important in scientific literature, it has been challenging to effectively implement selectivity in drug development and production. A major issue with selectivity in pharmaceuticals is that a large percentage of drug syntheses by nature are not selective reactions, racemic mixtures are formed as the products. Separating racemic mixtures into their respective enantiomers takes extra time, money, and energy. One way to separate enantiomers is to chemically convert them into species that can be separated: diastereomers. Diastereomers, unlike enantiomers, have entirely different physical properties—boiling points, melting points, NMR shifts, solubilities—and they can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography or recrystallization. This is a whole extra step in the synthesis process and not desirable from a manufacturing standpoint. As a result, a number of pharmaceuticals are synthesized and marketed as a racemic mixture of enantiomers in cases where the less-effective enantiomer is benign. However, by identifying and specifically purifying the enantiomer which effectively binds to its respective binding site in the body, less of the drug would be needed to achieve the desired effect.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the stereoisomeric composition of a chiral drug should be known, and its effects should be well-characterized from pharmacologic, toxicologic, and clinical standpoints. In order to profile the different stereoisomers of enantiopure drugs, manufacturers are urged to develop quantitative assays for individual enantiomers in \"in vivo\" samples early in the development stage.\n\nIdeally, the main pharmacologic activities of the isomers should be compared in \"in vitro\" systems in animals. During instances when toxic findings are present beyond the natural extensions of the pharmacologic effects of the drug, toxicologic evaluation of the individual isomers in question must be completed.\n\nWhen drugs are covered under patent protection, only the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent is allowed to manufacture, market, and eventually profit from them. The lifetime of the patent varies between countries and also between drugs; in the United States, most drug patents last about twenty years. Once the patent has expired, the drug can be manufactured and sold by other companies - at which point, it is referred to as a generic drug. Its availability on the market as a generic drug removes the monopoly of the patent holder, thereby encouraging competition and causing a significant drop in drug prices, which ensures that life-saving and important drugs reach the general population at fair prices. However, the company holding the initial patent may get a new patent by forming a new version of the drug that is significantly changed compared to the original compound. Patentability of different isomers has been controversial over the past ten years and there have been a number of related legal issues. In making their determinations, courts have looked at factors including: (i) whether the racemate was known in the prior art; (ii) the difficulty in resolving the enantiomer; (iii) the stereoselectivity of the relevant receptor; and (iv) other secondary considerations of non-obviousness such as commercial success, unexpected results, and satisfaction of long-felt needs in the art. The decisions made regarding these issues have varied and there is no clear answer to the legality of patenting stereoisomers. These issues have been resolved on a case-by-case basis. With the number of current pharmaceuticals currently being marketed as racemic mixtures, it is likely that patentability will continue to be debated in the near future.\n\nThe following table lists pharmaceuticals that have been available in both racemic and single-enantiomer form.\n\nThe following are cases where the individual enantiomers have markedly different effects:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48081", "title": "Essentialism", "text": "Essentialism\n\nEssentialism is the view that every entity has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function. In early Western thought Plato's idealism held that all things have such an \"essence\"—an \"idea\" or \"form\". In \"Categories\", Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that, as George Lakoff put it \"make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not \"that\" kind of thing\". The contrary view—non-essentialism—denies the need to posit such an \"essence'\".\n\nEssentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the \"Parmenides Dialogue\", depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the \"existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt\" . In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for taxonomy at least until the time of Charles Darwin; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.\nIn gender studies the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.\n\nAn \"essence\" characterizes a substance or a form, in the sense of the forms and ideas in Platonic idealism. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical humanism has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable human nature. This has been criticized by Kierkegaard, Marx, Heidegger, Sartre, and many other existential and materialist thinkers.\n\nIn Plato's philosophy (in particular, the \"Timaeus\" and the \"Philebus\"), things were said to come into being by the action of a demiurge who works to form chaos into ordered entities. Many definitions of \"essence\" hark back to the ancient Greek hylomorphic understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires \"hyle\" (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (\"morphe\"). Aristotle was the first to use the terms \"hyle\" and \"morphe\". According to his explanation, all entities have two aspects: \"matter\" and \"form\". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its quiddity or \"whatness\" (i.e., its \"what it is\").\n\nPlato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an abstract entity of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some \"idea\" in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read Plato's parable of the cave.)\n\nKarl Popper splits the ambiguous term \"realism\" into \"essentialism\" and \"realism\". He uses \"essentialism\" whenever he means the opposite of nominalism, and \"realism\" only as opposed to idealism. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like \"a puppy is a young dog\" should be read from right to left, as an answer to \"What shall we call a young dog\"; never from left to right as an answer to \"What is a puppy?\"\n\nEssentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of \"essence\". Unlike existentialism, which posits \"being\" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist ontology must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.\n\nPlato believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the \"essential\" or ideal and the \"perceived\". Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) applied the term \"essence\" to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, \"rationality\" is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, Bertrand Russell said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's \"essence\" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the \"name\" for it. Although the concept of essence was \"hopelessly muddled\" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.\n\nThe Egyptian-born philosopher Plotinus (204–270 CE) brought idealism to the Roman Empire as Neoplatonism, and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a \"primary essence\" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.\n\nDespite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, aesthetics, heuristics, psychology, and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate Diana Fuss, who wrote: \"Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity.\" Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas \"ultimate reality\" is held to be absolute essence.\n\nAmong contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is \"the power to exist\", which defines their \"uncreated\" Essence.\n\nIn 2010, an article by Gerald B. Folland in the \"Notices of the American Mathematical Society\" stated, \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …\" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define Lie algebra as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.\n\nThere is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is Susan Gelman, who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class. (Toosi & Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence (Dar-Nimrod & Heine, 2011).\n\nEssentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking (Rangel and Keller, 2011).\nYounger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding (Demoulin, Leyens & Yzerbyt, 2006).\n\nThere are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio & Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability (Holtz & Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu & Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.\n\nThe implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups (Morton, Hornsey & Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development. Paul Bloom of Yale University has stated that \"one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists.\" Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention (Bastian & Haslam, 2006).\n\nClassical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.\n\nMany modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.\n\nOne possibility is that before evolution was developed as a scientific theory, there existed an essentialist view of biology that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as Louis Agassiz in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator. Some religious opponents of evolution continue to maintain this view of biology.\n\nRecent work by historians of systematic biology has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as Linnaeus and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called \"essentialism story\" (or \"myth\") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from Aristotle onwards through to John Stuart Mill and William Whewell in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.\n\nIn feminist theory and gender studies, gender essentialism is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine. These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz states in her 1995 publication \"Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies\" that essentialism \"entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization.\"\n\nGender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 \"New York Times\" best seller \"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\", but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as \"Women: Images & Realities\".\n\nStarting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. Evelyn Fox Keller, Sandra Harding,\n\nEssentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. Herodotus, for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a \"softness\" which has made Egypt easy to conquer. To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity, or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his \"Histories\".\n\nEssentialism had been operative in colonialism as well as in critiques of colonialism.\n\nPost-colonial theorists such as Edward Said insisted that essentialism was the \"defining mode\" of \"Western\" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to Touraj Atabaki, manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as Eurocentrism, over-generalization, and reductionism.\n\nMost historians reject essentialism because it \"dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes\" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of Subaltern Studies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the days before computers and electronics, some were very sophisticated, using pneumatics, mechanics, and hydraulics. The first automata were conceived during the third and second centuries BC and these were demonstrated by the theorems of Hero of Alexandria, which included sophisticated mechanical and hydraulic solutions. Many of his notable works were included in the book \"Pneumatics\", which was also used for constructing machines until early modern times. In 1490, Leonardo Da Vinci also constructed an armored knight, which is considered the first humanoid robot in Western civilization.\n\nOther early famous examples include al-Jazari's humanoid robots. This Arabic inventor once constructed a band of automata, which can be commanded to play different pieces of music. There is also the case of Jacques de Vaucanson's artificial duck exhibited in 1735, which had thousands of moving parts and one of the first to mimic a biological system. The duck could reportedly eat and digest, drink, quack, and splash in a pool. It was exhibited all over Europe until it fell into disrepair.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the invention of cheap computing power that artificial life as a legitimate science began in earnest, steeped more in the theoretical and computational than the mechanical and mythological.\n\nOne of the earliest thinkers of the modern age to postulate the potentials of artificial life, separate from artificial intelligence, was math and computer prodigy John von Neumann. At the Hixon Symposium, hosted by Linus Pauling in Pasadena, California in the late 1940s, von Neumann delivered a lecture titled \"The General and Logical Theory of Automata.\" He defined an \"automaton\" as any machine whose behavior proceeded logically from step to step by combining information from the environment and its own programming, and said that natural organisms would in the end be found to follow similar simple rules. He also spoke about the idea of self-replicating machines. He postulated a machine – a kinematic automaton – made up of a control computer, a construction arm, and a long series of instructions, floating in a lake of parts. By following the instructions that were part of its own body, it could create an identical machine. He followed this idea by creating (with Stanislaw Ulam) a purely logic-based automaton, not requiring a physical body but based on the changing states of the cells in an infinite grid – the first cellular automaton. It was extraordinarily complicated compared to later CAs, having hundreds of thousands of cells which could each exist in one of twenty-nine states, but von Neumann felt he needed the complexity in order for it to function not just as a self-replicating \"machine\", but also as a universal computer as defined by Alan Turing. This \"universal constructor\" read from a tape of instructions and wrote out a series of cells that could then be made active to leave a fully functional copy of the original machine and its tape. Von Neumann worked on his automata theory intensively right up to his death, and considered it his most important work.\n\nHomer Jacobson illustrated basic self-replication in the 1950s with a model train set – a seed \"organism\" consisting of a \"head\" and \"tail\" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new \"organisms\" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.\nEdward F. Moore proposed \"Artificial Living Plants\", which would be floating factories which could create copies of themselves. They could be programmed to perform some function (extracting fresh water, harvesting minerals from seawater) for an investment that would be relatively small compared to the huge returns from the exponentially growing numbers of factories. Freeman Dyson also studied the idea, envisioning self-replicating machines sent to explore and exploit other planets and moons, and a NASA group called the Self-Replicating Systems Concept Team performed a 1980 study on the feasibility of a self-building lunar factory.\n\nUniversity of Cambridge professor John Horton Conway invented the most famous cellular automaton in the 1960s. He called it the Game of Life, and publicized it through Martin Gardner's column in \"Scientific American\" magazine.\n\nPhilosophy scholar Arthur Burks, who had worked with von Neumann (and indeed, organized his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the University of Michigan. He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker Charles Sanders Peirce into the modern age. Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic). The Michigan group was one of the few groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, Tommaso Toffoli argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature. Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were reversible, just as the true universe is considered to be.\n\nChristopher Langton was an unconventional researcher, with an undistinguished academic career that led him to a job programming DEC mainframes for a hospital. He became enthralled by Conway's Game of Life, and began pursuing the idea that the computer could emulate living creatures. After years of study (and a near-fatal hang-gliding accident), he began attempting to actualize Von Neumann's CA and the work of Edgar F. Codd, who had simplified Von Neumann's original twenty-nine state monster to one with only eight states. He succeeded in creating the first self-replicating computer organism in October 1979, using only an Apple II desktop computer. He entered Burks' graduate program at the Logic of Computers Group in 1982, at the age of 33, and helped to found a new discipline.\n\nLangton's official conference announcement of Artificial Life I was the earliest description of a field which had previously barely existed:\n\n\"Artificial life is the study of artificial systems that exhibit behavior characteristic of natural living systems. It is the quest to explain life in any of its possible manifestations, without restriction to the particular examples that have evolved on earth. This includes biological and chemical experiments, computer simulations, and purely theoretical endeavors. Processes occurring on molecular, social, and evolutionary scales are subject to investigation. The ultimate goal is to extract the logical form of living systems.\"\n\n\"Microelectronic technology and genetic engineering will soon give us the capability to create new life forms \"in silico\" as well as \"in vitro\". This capacity will present humanity with the most far-reaching technical, theoretical and ethical challenges it has ever confronted. The time seems appropriate for a gathering of those involved in attempts to simulate or synthesize aspects of living systems.\"\n\nEd Fredkin founded the Information Mechanics Group at MIT, which united Toffoli, Norman Margolus, Gerard Vichniac, and Charles Bennett. This group created a computer especially designed to execute cellular automata, eventually reducing it to the size of a single circuit board. This \"cellular automata machine\" allowed an explosion of alife research among scientists who could not otherwise afford sophisticated computers.\n\nIn 1982, computer scientist named Stephen Wolfram turned his attention to cellular automata. He explored and categorized the types of complexity displayed by one-dimensional CAs, and showed how they applied to natural phenomena such as the patterns of seashells and the nature of plant growth.\nNorman Packard, who worked with Wolfram at the Institute for Advanced Study, used CAs to simulate the growth of snowflakes, following very basic rules.\n\nComputer animator Craig Reynolds similarly used three simple rules to create recognizable flocking behaviour in a computer program in 1987 to animate groups of boids. With no top-down programming at all, the boids produced lifelike solutions to evading obstacles placed in their path. Computer animation has continued to be a key commercial driver of alife research as the creators of movies attempt to find more realistic and inexpensive ways to animate natural forms such as plant life, animal movement, hair growth, and complicated organic textures.\n\nThe Unit of Theoretical Behavioural Ecology at the Free University of Brussels applied the self-organization theories of Ilya Prigogine and the work of entomologist E.O. Wilson to research the behavior of social insects, particularly allelomimesis, in which an individual's actions are dictated by those of a neighbor. They developed partial differential equations which modeled the shapes created by termites when constructing their nest. They then compared that to the reaction of real termites to identical changes in laboratory colonies, and refined their theories about the rules which underlay the behavior.\n\nJ. Doyne Farmer was a key figure in tying artificial life research to the emerging field of complex adaptive systems, working at the Center for Nonlinear Studies (a basic research section of Los Alamos National Laboratory), just as its star chaos theorist Mitchell Feigenbaum was leaving. Farmer and Norman Packard chaired a conference in May 1985 called \"Evolution, Games, and Learning\", which was to presage many of the topics of later alife conferences.\n\nOn the ecological front, research regarding the evolution of animal cooperative behavior (started by W. D. Hamilton in the 1960s resulting in theories of kin selection, reciprocity, multilevel selection and cultural group selection) was re-introduced via artificial life by Peter Turchin and Mikhail Burtsev in 2006. Previously, game theory has been utilized in similar investigation, however, that approach was deemed to be rather limiting in its amount of possible strategies and debatable set of payoff rules. The alife model designed here, instead, is based upon Conway's Game of Life but with much added complexity (there are over 10 strategies that can potentially emerge). Most significantly, the interacting agents are characterized by external phenotype markers which allows for recognition amongst in-group members. In effect, it is shown that given the capacity to perceive these markers, agents within the system are then able to evolve new group behaviors under minimalistic assumptions. On top of the already known strategies of the bourgeois-hawk-dove game, here two novel modes of cooperative attack and defense arise from the simulation.\n\nFor the setup, this two-dimensional artificial world is divided into cells, each empty or containing a resource bundle. An empty cell can acquire a resource bundle with a certain probability per unit of time and lose it when an agent consumes the resource. Each agent is plainly constructed with a set of receptors, effectors (the components that govern the agents' behavior), and neural net which connect the two. In response to the environment, an agent may rest, eat, reproduce by division, move, turn and attack. All actions expend energy taken from its internal energy storage; once that is depleted, the agent dies. Consumption of resource, as well as other agents after defeating them, yields an increase in the energy storage. Reproduction is modeled as being asexual while the offspring receive half the parental energy. Agents are also equipped with sensory inputs that allow them to detect resources or other members within a parameter in addition to its own level of vitality. As for the phenotype markers, they do not influence behavior but solely function as indicator of 'genetic' similarity. Heredity is achieved by having the relevant information be inherited by the offspring and subjected to a set rate of mutation.\n\nThe objective of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as the resource available in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves to determine the effect of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.\n\nOne previously unseen strategy is termed the \"raven\". These agents leave cells with in-group members, thus avoiding intra-specific competition, and attack out-group members voluntarily. Another strategy, named the 'starling', involves the agent sharing cells with in-group members. Despite individuals having smaller energy storage due to resource partitioning, this strategy permits highly effective defense against large invaders via the advantage in numbers. Ecologically speaking, this resembles the mobbing behavior that characterizes many species of small birds when they collectively defend against the predator.\n\nIn conclusion, the research claims that the simulated results have important implications for the evolution of territoriality by showing that within the alife framework it is possible to \"model not only how one strategy displaces another, but also the very process by which new strategies emerge from a large quantity of possibilities\".\n\nWork is also underway to create cellular models of artificial life. Initial work on building a complete biochemical model of cellular behavior is underway as part of a number of different research projects, namely Blue Gene which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind protein folding.\n\n\nAguilar, W., Santamaría-Bonfil, G., Froese, T., and Gershenson, C.

{"id": "40963632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40963632", "title": "History of in vitro fertilisation", "text": "History of in vitro fertilisation\n\nThe history of in vitro fertilisation goes back more than half a century.\n\nThere was a transient biochemical pregnancy reported by Australian Foxton School researchers in 1953. John Rock was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg. In 1959, Min Chueh Chang at the Worcester Foundation, proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit. Chang's discovery was seminal, as it clearly demonstrated that oocytes fertilised in vitro were capable of developing, if transferred into the uterus and thereby produce live young. \n\nThe first pregnancy achieved through \"in vitro\" human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the Monash University team of Carl Wood, John Leeton and Alan Trounson in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy. Landrum Shettles attempted to perform an IVF in 1973, but his departmental chairman interdicted the procedure at the last moment. There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards in 1976. \n\nIn 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, Louise Brown on 25 July 1978, in Oldham General Hospital, Greater Manchester, UK.\n\nIn October 1978, it was reported that Subash Mukhopadyay, a relatively unknown physician from Kolkata, India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as \"Durga\" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978. However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.\n\nSteptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow. A team led by Ian Johnston and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne. It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.\n\nThis was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. Howard W. Jones and Georgeanna Seegar Jones at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.\n\nThe ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use. The other very significant milestone in IVF was the development of the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of single sperms by Gianpiero D. Palermo et al.in Brussels (UZ Brussel), 1992. This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy. Thus, IVF has become the final solution for most fertility problems, moving from tubal disease to male factor, idiopathic subfertility, endometriosis, advanced maternal age, and anovulation not responding to ovulation induction.\n\nRobert Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of \"in vitro\" fertilization\". Steptoe and Jean Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. Carl Wood was dubbed \"the father of IVF (\"in vitro\" fertilisation)\" for having pioneered the use of frozen embryos.\n\nIn the US, ART cycles started in 2006 resulted in 41,343 births (54,656 infants), which is slightly more than 1% of total US births. In 2012 it was estimated that five million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques.\n"}
{"id": "177052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177052", "title": "Immortality", "text": "Immortality\n\nImmortality is eternal life, being exempt from death, unending existence. Some modern species may possess biological immortality.\n\nCertain scientists, futurists, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that life extension is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or physical trauma; although mind uploading could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.\n\nIn religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of God (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow divine law. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.\n\nLife extension technologies promise a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, it is not known if it is possible for humans.\n\nMind uploading is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by futurists such as Ray Kurzweil.\n\nThe belief in an \"afterlife\" is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Judaism, and the Bahá'í Faith; however, the concept of an immortal soul is not. The \"soul\" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.\n\nPhysical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation or predictions of an impending technological singularity, or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by Rastafarians or Rebirthers.\n\nThere are three main causes of death: aging, disease and physical trauma. Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.\n\nAubrey de Grey, a leading researcher in the field, defines aging as \"a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.\" The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.\n\nDisease is theoretically surmountable via technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up. Human understanding of genetics is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. Preventative medicine is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's may soon be curable with the use of stem cells. Breakthroughs in cell biology and telomere research are leading to treatments for cancer. Vaccines are being researched for AIDS and tuberculosis. Genes associated with type 1 diabetes and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the nervous system may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.\n\nPhysical trauma would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of paramedic response remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma. A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for nanotechnology, would mitigate this factor.\nBeing the seat of consciousness, the brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.\n\nOrganisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.\n\nIf there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the cumulative probability of death over an infinite horizon is less than certainty, even when the risk of fatal trauma in any finite period is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving \"actuarial escape velocity\"\n\nBiological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.\n\nBiologists have chosen the word \"immortal\" to designate cells that are not limited by the Hayflick limit, where cells no longer divide because of DNA damage or shortened telomeres. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is HeLa, developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of Henrietta Lacks without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of Leonard Hayflick, there was the erroneous belief fostered by Alexis Carrel that all normal somatic cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a \"cap\" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. Telomerase is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times. No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.\n\nLife defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:\n\nAs the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in free energy from the environment and unloads its entropy as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of evolution, but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere \"end replication problem\" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms. This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.\n\nModern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:\n\nThere are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as resveratrol.\n\nSome scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of telomerase in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (Madrid) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were genetically engineered to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.\n\nIn normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most somatic cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.\n\nTechnological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of human cloning, cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. Robert Freitas, a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical nanorobots could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them. Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical biological machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book \"The Singularity Is Near\" that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a \"medical\" use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\"\n\nCryonics, the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and aging is reversible. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called vitrification which creates a glass-like state rather than freezing as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.\n\nOne idea that has been advanced involves uploading an individual's habits and memories via direct mind-computer interface. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. Extropian futurists like Moravec and Kurzweil have proposed that, thanks to exponentially growing computing power, it will someday be possible to upload human consciousness onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of identity, thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined. It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of consciousness in the functions of the mind. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality. Research on neural correlates of consciousness is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.\n\nTransforming a human into a cyborg can include brain implants or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.\n\nAs late as 1952, the editorial staff of the \"\" found in their compilation of the Great Books of the Western World, that \"The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul.\" Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife.\n\nImmortality in ancient Greek religion originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in Homer, Hesiod, and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Iphigenia, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. Asclepius was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus' Histories, the 7th century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.\n\nThe philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either Pherecydes or the Orphics, and most importantly advocated by Plato and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: \"when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.\" (\"1 Apol.\" 21).\n\nThe goal of Hinayana is Arhatship and Nirvana. By contrast, the goal of Mahayana is Buddhahood.\n\nAccording to one Tibetan Buddhist teaching, Dzogchen, individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the rainbow body.\n\nChristian theology holds that Adam and Eve lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the Fall of man, although this initial \"imperishability of the bodily frame of man\" was \"a preternatural condition\".\nChristians who profess the Nicene Creed believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the Second Coming, and this belief is known as Universal resurrection.\n\nN.T. Wright, a theologian and former Bishop of Durham, has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told Time: \"Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon his return. Part of this will be the resurrection of all the dead, who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says John Polkinghorne, a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the Intermediate state) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering Christ's kingdom.\" This kingdom will consist of Heaven and Earth \"joined together in a new creation\", he said.\n\nHindus believe in an immortal soul which is reincarnated after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called \"samsara\". If they live their life well, their \"karma\" improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss. There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.\n\nThere are explicit renderings in the Upanishads alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated \"When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death.\"\n\nAnother view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi:\n\nThat man indeed whom these (contacts)<br>do not disturb, who is even-minded in<br>pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit<br>for immortality, O best of men.\n\nTo Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, \"Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life ... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life.\"\n\nAn Indian Tamil saint known as Vallalar claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.\n\nSikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to earth as they please to help the world a better place. \n\nThe traditional concept of an immaterial and immortal soul distinct from the body was not found in Judaism before the Babylonian Exile, but developed as a result of interaction with Persian and Hellenistic philosophies. Accordingly, the Hebrew word \"nephesh\", although translated as \"soul\" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to \"living being\". \"Nephesh\" was rendered in the Septuagint as \"\" (\"psūchê\"), the Greek word for soul.\n\nThe only Hebrew word traditionally translated \"soul\" (\"nephesh\") in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul. In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated \"soul\" () has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul. ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).\n\nThe Hebrew Bible speaks about \"Sheol\" (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the resurrection of the dead. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the intertestamental period.\n\nThe views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in Second Temple Period. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, and in Apocalypse of Baruch. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the Dead Sea scrolls texts. Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.\n\nRabbinic Judaism claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the Messianic Age with the coming of the messiah. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The Tanakh is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.\n\nIt is repeatedly stated in Lüshi Chunqiu that death is unavoidable. Henri Maspero noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality. Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a \"way of life\" than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done. In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.\n\nZoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for \"immortal\" is associated with the month \"Amurdad\", meaning \"deathless\" in Persian, in the Iranian calendar (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or Ameretat is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the \"Angel of Immortality\" won over the \"Angel of Death\" in this month.\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.\n\nPlato's \"Phaedo\" advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotinus offers a version of the argument that Kant calls \"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\". Plotinus first argues that the soul is simple, then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with Moses Mendelssohn's Phaedon.\n\nTheodore Metochites argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.\n\nAvicenna argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.\n\nThe full argument for the immortality of the soul and Thomas Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the \"Summa Theologica\".\n\nRené Descartes endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.\n\nIn early work, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his monadology he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.\n\nMoses Mendelssohn's \"Phaedon\" is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue \"Phaedo\", in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.\n\nThe possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include persistent vegetative states, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, social and economic disparities created by longevity, and survival of the heat death of the universe.\n\nPhysical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in Mary Shelley's short story \"The Mortal Immortal\", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. Jorge Luis Borges explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story \"The Immortal\"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book \"Thursday's Fictions\", and the stage and film adaptations of it, Richard James Allen tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him. Likewise, the novel \"Tuck Everlasting\" depicts immortality as \"falling off the wheel of life\" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime \"Casshern Sins\" humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In Anne Rice's book series \"The Vampire Chronicles\", vampires are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.\n\nIn his book \"Death\", Yale philosopher Shelly Kagan argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.\n\nIf human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own mortality shapes their behavior. With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.\n\nAlthough some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable, there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.\n\nThere are numerous symbols representing immortality. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the and pharaohs, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The Möbius strip in the shape of a trefoil knot is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the Ouroboros, the Chinese fungus of longevity, the \"ten\" kanji, the phoenix, the peacock in Christianity, and the colors amaranth (in Western culture) and peach (in Chinese culture).\n\nImmortality is a popular subject in fiction, as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own mortality. Immortal beings and species abound in fiction, especially fantasy fiction, and the meaning of \"immortal\" tends to vary. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.\n\nSome fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the Q from the \"Star Trek\" series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with Morgoth in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Silmarillion\" and the Dreaming God of \"Pathways Into Darkness\". Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, Superman is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: Kryptonite. (See also Achilles' heel.)\n\nMany fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy elves often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as vampires and the immortals in the film \"Highlander\", can only die from beheading. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a silver bullet (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Best known for her research on time, money and happiness, Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures. She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the Society for Consumer Psychology and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.\n\nAaker was born in Palo Alto, California, to Kay Aaker, and David Aaker, a professor and brand consultant. Aaker attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied under social psychologist Philip E. Tetlock and Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers in \"Journal of Marketing Research\" and \"Journal of Consumer Research\" and won several awards.\n\nAaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing. Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in \"The Economist\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Washington Post\", \"BusinessWeek\", \"Forbes,\" NPR, \"CBS MoneyWatch\", \"Inc.\" and \"Science.\" She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.\n\nAs a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a \"Dimensions of Brand Personality\" framework to describe and measure the \"personality\" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness. In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate. Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.\n\nIn 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with Sep Kamvar and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness. Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic. Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.\n\nAaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.\n\nIn 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book \"The Dragonfly Effect: Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.\" With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] \"The Dragonfly Effect\" has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published \"The Power of Stories\", a companion to \"The Dragonfly Effect\", which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.\n\nIn a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks. an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry. In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors. \"Social media is not inherently meaningful,\" Aaker said in an interview on the subject. \"Yet the power of social technology, when fully engaged, can be nothing short of revolutionary.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life: the work is a kind of philosophical testament. Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together.\n\nThe imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a Stoic, was a contemporary of Alexander the Great, remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers. Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an Epicurean. His views, including atheism, are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries Holbach, La Mettrie and Diderot.\n\nIn the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues:\n\nThere are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world - what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'.\n\nThe dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much.\n\nVoltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37–40 are not in his hand). However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates. Likewise Grimm does not mention it. The \"Mémoires secrets\" from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from Jean-Louis Wagnière indicated that the \"Dialogues\" had been published only shortly before.\n\nOver the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions. He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship. Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed.\n\nThe frontispiece of the first known edition of the \"Dialogues d'Evhémère\" indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the \"Mémoires secrets\" but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher. In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in Lausanne, by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher François Grasset. Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.\n\n"}

{"id": "380890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380890", "title": "Nanobacterium", "text": "Nanobacterium\n\nNanobacterium ( , pl. \"nanobacteria\" ) is the unit or member name of a proposed class of living organisms, specifically cell-walled microorganisms with a size much smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life (about 200 nm for bacteria, like mycoplasma). Originally based on observed nano-scale structures in geological formations (including one meteorite), the status of nanobacteria has been controversial, with some researchers suggesting they are a new class of living organism capable of incorporating radiolabeled uridine, and others attributing to them a simpler, abiotic nature. One skeptic dubbed them \"the cold fusion of microbiology\", in reference to a notorious episode of supposed erroneous science. The term \"calcifying nanoparticles\" (CNPs) has also been used as a conservative name regarding their possible status as a life form.\n\nResearch tends to agree that these structures exist, and appear to replicate in some way. However, the idea that they are living entities has now largely been discarded, and the particles are instead thought to be nonliving crystallizations of minerals and organic molecules.\n\nIn 1981 Torella and Morita described very small cells called ultramicrobacteria. Defined as being smaller than 300 nm, by 1982 MacDonell and Hood found that some could pass through a 200 nm membrane. Early in 1989, geologist Robert L. Folk found what he later identified as \"nannobacteria\" (written with double \"n\"), that is, nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens in travertine from hot springs of Viterbo, Italy. Initially searching for a bacterial cause for travertine deposition, scanning electron microscope examination of the mineral where no bacteria were detectable revealed extremely small objects which appeared to be biological. His first oral presentation elicited what he called \"mostly a stony silence\", at the 1992 Geological Society of America's annual convention. He proposed that nanobacteria are the principal agents of precipitation of all minerals and crystals on Earth formed in liquid water, that they also cause all oxidation of metals, and that they are abundant in many biological specimens.\n\nIn 1996, NASA scientist David McKay published a study suggesting the existence of nanofossils — fossils of Martian nanobacteria — in ALH84001, a meteorite originating from Mars and found in Antarctica.\n\n\"Nanobacterium sanguineum\" was proposed in 1998 as an explanation of certain kinds of pathologic calcification (apatite in kidney stones) by Finnish researcher Olavi Kajander and Turkish researcher Neva Ciftcioglu, working at the University of Kuopio in Finland. According to the researchers the particles self-replicated in microbiological culture, and the researchers further reported having identified DNA in these structures by staining.\n\nA paper published in 2000 by a team led by an NIH scientist John Cisar further tested these ideas. It stated that what had previously been described as \"self-replication\" was a form of crystalline growth. The only DNA detected in his specimens was identified as coming from the bacteria \"Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum\", which is a common contaminant in PCR reactions.\n\nIn 2004 a Mayo Clinic team led by Franklin Cockerill, John Lieske, and Virginia M. Miller, reported to have isolated nanobacteria from diseased human arteries and kidney stones. Their results were published in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Similar findings were obtained in 2005 by László Puskás at the DNA Lab, University of Szeged, Hungary. Dr. Puskás identified these particles in cultures obtained from human atherosclerotic aortic walls and blood samples of atherosclerotic patients but the group was unable to detect DNA in these samples.\n\nIn 2005, Ciftcioglu and her research team at NASA used a rotating cell culture flask, which simulates some aspects of low-gravity conditions, to culture nanobacteria suspected of rapidly forming kidney stones in astronauts. In this environment, they were found to multiply five times faster than in normal Earth gravity. The study concluded that nanobacteria might have a potential role in forming kidney stones and may need to be screened for in crews pre-flight.\n\nThe February 2008 \"Public Library of Science (PLoS) Pathogens\" article focused on the comprehensive characterization of nanobacteria. The authors say that their results rule out the existence of nanobacteria as living entities and that they are instead a unique self-propagating entity, namely self-propagating mineral-fetuin complexes.\n\nAn April 2008 \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\" article also reported that blood nanobacteria are not living organisms and stated that \"CaCO precipitates prepared \"in vitro\" are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies.\" The growth of such \"biomorphic\" inorganic precipitates was studied in detail in a 2009 \"Science\" paper, which showed that unusual crystal growth mechanisms can produce witherite precipitates from barium chloride and silica solutions that closely resemble primitive organisms. The authors commented on the close resemblance of these crystals to putative nanobacteria, stating that their results showed that evidence for life cannot rest on morphology alone.\n\nFurther work on the importance of nanobacteria in geology by R. L. Folk and co-workers includes study of calcium carbonate Bahama ooids, silicate clay minerals, metal sulfides, and iron oxides. In all these chemically diverse minerals, the putative nanobacteria are approximately the same size, mainly 0.05 to 0.2 μm. This suggests a commonality of origin. At least for the type locality at Viterbo, Italy, the biogenicity of these minute cells has been supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Slices through a green bioslime showed entities from 0.4 down to as small as 0.09 μm with definite cell walls and interior dots resembling ribosomes; and even smaller objects with cell walls and lucent interiors with diameters of 0.05 μm. Culturable organisms on earth are the same 0.05 μm size as the supposed nanobacteria on Mars.\n\n\n"}

This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.\n\nStudy of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process and influence theories of aging. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.\n\nThere are also organisms that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality (see also Late-life mortality deceleration). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as \"Turritopsis dohrnii\".\n\nRecent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's genome, specifically transcription processes, over its lifetime.\n\nSome fish, such as some varieties of sturgeon and rougheye rockfish, and some tortoises and turtles are thought to be negligibly senescent, although recent research on turtles has uncovered evidence of senescence in the wild. The age of a captured fish specimen can be measured by examining growth patterns similar to tree rings on the otoliths (parts of motion-sensing organs).\n\nIn plants, aspen trees are one example of biological immortality. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the root system of the clonal colony is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in Utah, given the nickname of \"Pando\", is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens.\n\nThe world's oldest known living non-clonal organism was the Methuselah tree of the species \"Pinus longaeva\" growing high in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California, aged years.\nThis record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.\n\nAmong bacteria, individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the colony, bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from cell division of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony. The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted. See asexual reproduction.\n\nSome examples of maximum observed life span of animals thought to be negligibly senescent are:\nSome rare organisms, such as tardigrades, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of cryptobiosis, whereby their metabolism is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of cryonics that the human central nervous system can be similarly put into a state of suspended animation shortly before brain death to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.\n\n"}
{"id": "41077350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41077350", "title": "OpenWorm", "text": "OpenWorm\n\nOpenWorm is an international open science project to simulate the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" at the cellular level as a simulation. Although the long-term goal is to model all 959 cells of the \"C. elegans\", the first stage is to model the worm's locomotion by simulating the 302 neurons and 95 muscle cells. This bottom up simulation is being pursued by the OpenWorm community. As of this writing, a physics engine called Sibernetic has been built for the project and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in NeuroML format. A 3D model of the worm anatomy can be accessed through the web via the OpenWorm browser. The OpenWorm project is also contributing to develop Geppetto, a web-based multi-algorithm, multi-scale simulation platform engineered to support the simulation of the whole organism.\n\nThe roundworm \"C. elegans\" has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its hermaphrodite type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural connectome of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a \"C. elegans\" worm, and because \"C. Elegans\" is a model organism, each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.\n\nIn the process of trying to build an \"in silico\" model of a relatively simple organism like \"C. elegans\", new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.\n\nProject Nemaload was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, David Dalrymple, is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.\n\nAlthough the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of \"C. elegans\"' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus > Sensory Transduction > Interneuron Firing > Motor Neuron Firing > Motor Output > Environmental Change > Sensory Transduction.\n\nThere are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.\n\nThe OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like digestion) which the team will tackle at a later time.\n\nThe team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in NeuroML. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of \"C. elegans\".\n\nUsing NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.\n\nThe next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.\n\nThe rough plan is to then both:\n\nAs of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are \"only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get\".\n\nIn 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.\n\nIn 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.\n\nIn 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a \"sense-process-react\" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.\n\nThese early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the synaptic weights at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.\n\nThe Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of open science. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.\n\nOpen Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred \"members\" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses \"virtual lab meetings\" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.\n\n"}
{"id": "31564169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31564169", "title": "Philosophy of happiness", "text": "Philosophy of happiness\n\nThe philosophy of happiness is the philosophical concern with the existence, nature, and attainment of happiness. Philosophers believe, happiness can be understood as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance; indeed, in most European languages the term happiness is synonymous with luck. Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it.\n\nPlato (c. 428 c. 347 BCE), using Socrates (c. 470 399 BCE) as the main character in his philosophical dialogues, outlined the requirements for happiness in \"The Republic\".\n\nIn \"The Republic\", Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the cardinal virtues, particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the Ring of Gyges, Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.\n\nHe also sees a type of happiness stemming from social justice through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.\n\nAristotle (384 – 322 BCE) held that \"eudaimonia\" (Greek: ) is the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is usually translated as happiness, but \"human flourishing\" may be a more accurate translation. Eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (\"arete\", Greek: ἀρετή) in accordance with virtue.\n\nWithin the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible. Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation.\n\nAristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this moral skepticism.\n\nAntisthenes (c. 445 – c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of Cynicism, advocated an ascetic life lived in accordance with virtue. Xenophon testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang \"from out of one's soul,\" and Diogenes Laertius relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: \"I would rather go mad than feel pleasure.\" He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a Socrates.\n\nHe, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives. Thus, happiness can be gained through rigorous training (askesis, Greek: ) and by living in a way which was natural for humans, rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a simple life free from all possessions.\n\nDiogenes of Sinope (c. 412 – c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The Stoics themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of sage.\n\nStoicism was a school of philosophy established by Zeno of Citium (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was syncretic in thought, his primary influence were the Cynics, with Crates of Thebes (c. 365 – c. 285 BCE) as his mentor.\n\nStoics believe that \"virtue is sufficient for happiness\". One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a sage. In the words of Epictetus, this sage would be \"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,\"\n\nThe Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying Stoic logic, Stoic physics, and Stoic ethics.\n\nThe Cyrenaics were a school of philosophy established by Aristippus of Cyrene (c. 435 – c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind. Claudius Aelianus, in his \"Historical Miscellany\", writes about Aristippus:\n\nSome immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.\n\nEpicureanism was founded by Epicurus (c. 341 – c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of tranquility (\"ataraxia\", Greek: ) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (\"aponia\", Greek: ). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an ascetic lifestyle, noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics.\n\nOne aid to achieving happiness is the \"tetrapharmakos\" or the four-fold cure:\n\n\"Do not fear god,<br>\nDo not worry about death;<br>\nWhat is good is easy to get, and<br>\nWhat is terrible is easy to endure.\"<br>\n(\"Philodemus, Herculaneum Papyrus, 1005, 4.9–14\").\n\nThe School of the Sextii was founded by Quintus Sextius the Elder (fl. 50 BCE). It characterized itself mainly as a philosophical-medical school, blending Pythagorean, Platonic, Cynic, and Stoic elements together. They argued that to achieve happiness, one ought to be vegetarian, have nightly examinations of conscience, and avoid both consumerism and politics, and believe that an elusive incorporeal power pervades the body.\n\nSt. Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD) was an early Christian theologian and philosopher whose writings influenced the development of Western Christianity and Western philosophy.\n\nFor St. Augustine, all human actions revolve around love, and the primary problem humans face is the misplacing of love. Only in God can one find happiness, as He is source of happiness. Since humanity was brought forth from God, but has since fallen, one's soul dimly remembers the happiness from when one was with God. Thus, if one orients themselves toward the love of God, all other loves will become properly ordered. In this manner, St. Augustine follows the Neoplatonic tradition in asserting that happiness lays in the contemplation of the purely intelligible realm.\n\nSt. Augustine deals with the concept of happiness directly in his treatises \"De beata vita\" and \"Contra Academicos\".\n\nBoethius (c. 480–524 AD) was a philosopher, most famous for writing \"The Consolation of Philosophy\". The work has been described as having had the single most important influence on the Christianity of the Middle Ages and early Renaissance and as the last great work of the Classical Period. The book describes many themes, but among them he discusses how happiness can be attainable despite changing fortune, while considering the nature of happiness and God.\n\nHe posits that happiness is acquired by attaining the perfect good, and that perfect good is God. He then concludes that as God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.\n\nAvicenna (c. 980–1037), also known as 'Ibn-Sina', was polymath and jurist; he is regarded as one of the most significant thinkers in the Islamic Golden Age. According to him, happiness is the aim of humans, and that real happiness is pure and free from worldly interest. Ultimately, happiness is reached through the conjunction of the human intellect with the separate active intellect.\n\nAl-Ghazali (c. 1058–1111) was a Muslim theologian, jurist, philosopher, and mystic of Persian descent. Produced near the end of his life, al-Ghazali wrote \"The Alchemy of Happiness\" (\"Kimiya-yi Sa'ādat\", (). In the work, he emphasizes the importance of observing the ritual requirements of Islam, the actions that would lead to salvation, and the avoidance of sin. Only by exercising the human faculty of reason - a God-given ability - can one transform the soul from worldliness to complete devotion to God, the ultimate happiness.\n\nAccording to Al-Ghazali, there are four main constituents of happiness: self-knowledge, knowledge of God, knowledge of this world as it really is, and the knowledge of the next world as it really is.\n\nMaimonides (c. 1135-1204) was a Jewish philosopher and astronomer, who became one of the most prolific and influential Torah scholars and physicians. He writes that happiness is ultimately and essentially intellectual.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274 AD) was a philosopher and theologian, who became a Doctor of the Church in 1323. His system syncretized Aristotelianism and Catholic theology within his \"Summa Theologica\". The first part of the second part is divided into 114 articles, the first five deal explicitly with the happiness of humans. He states that happiness is achieved by cultivating several intellectual and moral virtues, which enable us to understand the nature of happiness and motivate us to seek it in a reliable and consistent way. Yet, one will be unable to find the greatest happiness in this life, because final happiness consists in a supernatural union with God. As such, man’s happiness does not consist of wealth, status, pleasure, or in any created good at all. Most goods do not have a necessary connection to happiness, since the ultimate object of man’s will, can only be found in God, who is the source of all good.\n\nMichel de Montaigne (1533-1592) was a French philosopher. Influenced by Aristotelianism and Christianity, alongside the conviction of the separation of public and private spheres of life, Montaigne writes that happiness is a subjective state of mind and that satisfaction differs from person to person. He continues by acknowledging that one must be allowed a private sphere of life to realize those particular attempts of happiness without the interference of society.\n\nJeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was a British philosopher, jurist, and social reformer. He is regarded as the founder of modern utilitarianism.\n\nHis particular brand of utilitarianism indicated that the most moral action is that which causes the highest amount of utility, where defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain. Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong - such as ascetic sacrifice. This manner of thinking permits the possibility of a calculator to measure happiness and moral value.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) was a German philosopher. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, where as only compassion can be a moral act.\n\nSchopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when times moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.\n\nWładysław Tatarkiewicz (1886-1980) was a Polish philosopher, historian of philosophy, historian of art, esthetician, and ethicist.\n\nFor Tatarkiewicz, happiness is a fundamental ethical category.\n\nHerbert Marcuse (1898–1979) was a German-American philosopher, sociologist, and political theorist, associated with the Frankfurt School of critical theory.\n\nIn his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation.\n\nIn the \"One-Dimensional Man\", his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be democratic, but is authoritarian in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase. He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging.\n\nViktor Frankl (1905-1997) was an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor and founder of logotherapy. His philosophy revolved around the emphasis on meaning, the value of suffering, and responsibility to something greater than the self; only if one encounters those questions can one be happy.\n\nRobert Nozick (1938-2002) was an American philosopher.\n\nIn his 1974 book, \"Anarchy, State, Utopia\", he proposed a thought experiment where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life.\n\nScientism is the approach that the empirical sciences are the most valuable branches of learning and culture.\n\nHappiness economics is the quantitative and theoretical study of happiness, positive and negative affect, well-being, quality of life, life satisfaction and related concepts, typically combining economics with other fields such as psychology and sociology. The tracking of Gross National Happiness or the satisfaction of life grow increasingly popular as the economics of happiness challenges traditional economic aims.\n\nRichard Layard has been very influential in this area. He has shown that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness.\n\nSonja Lyubomirsky asserted in her 2007 book, \"The How of Happiness\", that happiness is 50 percent genetically determined (based on twin studies), 10 percent circumstancial, and 40 percent subject to self-control. Lyubomirsky suggests a twelve-point program to maximize the final 40 percent.\n\nNot all cultures seek to maximise happiness, and some cultures are averse to happiness.\n\n\n\n"}

Haldane when asked what evidence could destroy his confidence in the theory of evolution and the field of study. The answers became popular imagery in debates about evolution and the scientific field of evolutionary biology in the 1990s. Many of Haldane's statements about his scientific research were popularized in his lifetime.\n\nSome accounts use this response to rebut claims that the theory of evolution is not falsifiable by any empirical evidence. This followed an assertion by philosopher, Karl Popper, who had proposed that \"falsifiability\" is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.\n\nRabbits are mammals. From the perspective of the philosophy of science, it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of mammalian fossils in Precambrian rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, though if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern understanding about the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals whose emergence in the geologic timescale is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the Triassic period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the Palaeocene and Eocene epochs of the Palaeogene period. Hundreds of millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.\n\nSeveral authors have written that J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964) said that the discovery of a fossil rabbit in Precambrian rocks would be enough to destroy his belief in evolution. However these references date from the 1990s or later. In 1996 Michael J. Benton cited the 1993 edition of Mark Ridley's book \"Evolution\", Richard Dawkins wrote in 2005 that Haldane was responding to a challenge by a \"Popperian zealot\". In 2004 Richa Arora wrote that the story was told by John Maynard Smith (1920–2004) in a television programme. John Maynard Smith attributed the phrase to Haldane in a conversation with Paul Harvey in the early 1970s.\n\nThe philosopher Karl Popper held that any scientific proposition must be falsifiable, in other words it must at least be possible to imagine some reproducible experiment or observation whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis. Initially he thought that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (often summarized as \"the survival of the fittest\") was untestable in this sense, and therefore \"almost tautological.\" Popper later changed his view, concluding that the theory of natural selection is falsifiable and that Darwin's own example of the peacock's tail had disproved one extreme variation of it, that \"all\" evolution is driven by natural selection. Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically to the theory of natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that \"Darwinism\" or \"Darwin's theory of evolution\" was a \"metaphysical research programme\" because it was not falsifiable. In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on population genetics, the study of the relative frequencies of alleles (different forms of the same gene). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled Lamarckianism or saltationism, evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms. In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that \"historical sciences\" such as paleontology or the history of evolution of life on Earth were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.\n\nFurther confusion arose in 1980–1981, when there was a long debate in the pages of \"Nature\" about the scientific status of the theory of evolution. Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the unit of selection in the genome, with one side positing natural selection, and the other, neutral mutation. Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as Phillip E. Johnson took this as an opportunity to declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins said that the discovery of fossil mammals in Precambrian rocks would \"completely blow evolution out of the water.\" Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith doubted that a single set of anachronistic fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove the theory of evolution outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged \"Precambrian rabbits\" really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the \"fossils\", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a hoax such as the Piltdown Man was shown to be. Even if the \"Precambrian rabbits\" turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific \"family tree\" that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, \"Precambrian rabbits\" would prove that there were one or more serious errors somewhere in this package, and the next task would be to identify those errors.\n\nBenton pointed out that, in the short term, scientists often have to accept the existence of competing hypotheses, each of which explains large parts—but not all—of the observed relevant data.\n\nGenuine fossils of earliest rabbits are from the Eocene Epoch, about 56 to 33.9 million years ago. Members of the genus \"Gomphos\" are established to be the phylogenetic root of lagomorph rabbits and hares. To date, the oldest \"Gomphos\" is \"G. elkema\" discovered in 2008 from Gujarat, India. The fossil is dated to 53 million years old.\n\n"}

These are visually represented by the three \"star gods\" of the same names (\"Fú, Lù, Shòu\"), commonly depicted as three male figurines (each wearing a distinctive garment and holding an object that enables them to be differentiated), or the Chinese ideographs/characters themselves, or various homophones or objects with relevant attributes. \"Shòu\" is instantly recognizable. \"He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate \"fu\" happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity.\" His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title \"Longevity Star Old-pate\".\n\nThe Chinese character \"shòu\" (寿) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry, generally in its more complex ideograph (壽), but also in its simplified (post-1950) form (寿). The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. \n\nLongevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (\"wǔfú\" 五福 - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief that are often depicted in the homophonous rendition of five flying bats because the word for \"bat\" in Chinese (\"fú\" 蝠) sounds like the word for \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\" or in this case, \"blessings\". In this arrangement, the \"shòu\" ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat.\n\nOther symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include pine trees, cranes, spotted deer, special collectors' stones (\"shòushí\" 寿石), peaches, and tortoises. These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees). \n\nPerhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: \"shòu shān fú hǎi\" (寿山福海), which can be translated as \"May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas\".\n\nSince 2017, the version 10 of the Unicode Standard features a rounded version of the symbol in the \"Enclosed Ideographic Supplement\" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU).\n\nAs a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. Palace of Tranquil Longevity in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is Kotobuki 寿 (see Nakajima Kotobuki, Tsukasa Kotobuki). See also Jurōjin (Shou Laoren) and Fukurokuju.\n\n"}

Epstein & Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nFundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the University of Maryland where economist Thomas Schelling presented his paper titled \"Models of Segregation\". Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the social environment modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.\n\nJohn Conway's agent-based simulation \"Game of Life\" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell in their book \"Growing Artificial Societies\". To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as \"the Sugarscape model\". Since then, the name \"Sugarscape\" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein & Axtell.\n\nAll Sugarscape models include the agents (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.\n\nThe original model presented by J. Epstein & R. Axtell (considered as the first large scale agent model) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.\n\nSugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.\n\nExact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein & R. Axtell in their book can be problematic and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in \"Growing Artificial Societies\".\n\nThe Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as open source software.\n\nAn original implementation was developed in Ascape, Java software suitable for agent-based social simulation. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.\n\nNetLogo has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: \"Immediate Growback\", \"Constant Growback\" and \"Wealth Distribution\". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. \"It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in \"Growing Artificial Societies\" with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model).\" The model is equipped with rich documentation including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.\n\nDue to the emergent nature of agent-based models (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled. However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on computing clusters has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with Moore's law, the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from Michigan Technological University used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of Graphics processing units (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.\n\nAnother implementation can be found written in Mathematica.\n\nGMU's MASON project, available under the Academic Free License, also includes an implementation of Sugarscape.\n\n"}

Ray in the early 1990s in which computer programs compete for time (central processing unit (CPU) time) and space (access to main memory). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be evolvable and can mutate, self-replicate and recombine. Tierra's virtual machine is written in C. It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).\n\nThe basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore \"in silico\" the basic processes of evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of punctuated equilibrium, host-parasite co-evolution and density-dependent natural selection are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of evolutionary computation, such as genetic algorithms, is that there is no explicit, or exogenous fitness function built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being \"optimized\"; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.\n\nAccording to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more \"open-ended\" evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see evolvability), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to 'evolve'. The issue of how true open-ended evolution can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of artificial life.\n\nMark Bedau and Norman Packard developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau \"et al.\" applied these statistics to Evita, an Artificial life model similar to Tierra and Avida, but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.\n\nRussell K. Standish has measured the informational complexity of Tierran 'organisms', and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.\n\nTierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional mathematical models, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see systems biology).\n\n\n\n"}
