{"id": "1052571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052571", "title": "Acronym", "text": "Acronym\n\nAn acronym is a word or name formed as an abbreviation from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in \"NATO\" or \"laser\") and sometimes syllables (as in \"Benelux\").\n\nThere are no universal standards for the multiple names for such abbreviations or for their orthographic styling. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.\n\nWhereas an abbreviation may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, \"Rd\" for \"road\" or \"Dr\" for \"Doctor\"), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as \"sonar\", created from \"und vigation and anging\"). Attestations for \"\" in German are known from 1921, and for \"acronym\" in English from 1940.\n\nAlthough the word \"acronym\" is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters, some dictionaries and usage commentators define \"acronym\" to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word, in contrast to an initialism (or alphabetism)an abbreviation formed from a string of initials (and possibly pronounced as individual letters).\nSome dictionaries include additional senses equating \"acronym\" with \"initialism\". The distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters. Examples in reference works that make the distinction include \"NATO\" , \"scuba\" , and \"radar\" for acronyms; and \"FBI\" , \"CRT\" , and \"HTML\" for initialisms. The rest of this article uses \"acronym\" for both types of abbreviation.\n\nThe distinction is not well-maintained. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\": \"A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... \"Initialism\", an older word than \"acronym\", seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with \"acronym\" in a narrow sense.\" About the use of \"acronym\" to only mean those pronounced as words, \"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" (3rd ed.) states: \"The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, \"acronym\" is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called \"initialisms\".\"\n\nA clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles & Algeo (1970), who divided \"acronyms\" as a general category into \"word acronyms\" pronounced as words, and \"initialisms\" sounded out as letters.\n\nThere is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as \"JPEG\" and \"MS-DOS\" . There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms \"URL\" and \"IRA\" can be pronounced as individual letters: and , respectively; or as a single word: and , respectively.\nThe spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism (that is, what it stands for) is called its \"expansion\".\n\n\nAcronymy, like retronymy, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no naming, conscious attention, or systematic analysis until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.\n\nAncient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it) include the following:\n\nDuring the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating corporation names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of railroad cars (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on ticker tape and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include Nabisco (National Biscuit Company), Esso (from S.O., from Standard Oil), and Sunoco (Sun Oil Company).\n\nAnother driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as ANV for \"Army of Northern Virginia\" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in World War I and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II, who themselves were referred to as G.I.s.\n\nThe widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") records the first printed use of the word \"initialism\" as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after \"acronym\" had become common.\n\nBy 1943, the term \"acronym\" had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words. (It was formed from the Greek words , ', \"topmost, extreme\" and , ', \"name.\") For example, the army offense of being \"absent without official leave\" was abbreviated to \"A.W.O.L.\" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (\"awol\"), it became an acronym. While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was \"a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words\", for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.\n\nIn English, acronyms \"pronounced as words\" may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in \"Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends\" claims that \"forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is \"colinderies\" or \"colinda\", an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.\" However, although acronymic words seem not to have been \"employed in general vocabulary\" before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the \"concept of their formation\" is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, \"How to Write a Blackwood Article\", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.\n\nThe use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:\n\n\nThe earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the \"OED\" is \"abjud\" (now \"abjad\"), formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late 18th century. Some acrostics predate this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II's Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the \"CABAL\" ministry.\n\nAcronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the \"alphabet agencies\" (also jokingly referred to as \"alphabet soup\") created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (also of course known as FDR) under the New Deal. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for \"commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific\"; it's also seen as \"ComCruDesPac\". \"YABA-compatible\" (where YABA stands for \"yet another bloody acronym\") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., \"When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'.\"\n\nAcronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as \"GF\" (girlfriend), \"LOL\" (laughing out loud), and \"DL\" (download or down low) have become popular. Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use \"pure\" or \"proper\" English. Others point out that language change has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in \"proper\" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper column inches).\n\nIn formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a common noun such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a proper noun such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at Case > Casing of expansions).\n\nIn addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).\n\nExpansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.\n\nAcronyms often occur in jargon. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.\n\nThe medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.\nAcronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are ROY G. BIV (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include CAN SLIM, and PAVPANIC as well as PEMDAS.\n\nIt is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology, called a \"folk etymology\", for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends. For example, \"cop\" is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from \"constable on patrol,\" and \"posh\" from \"port out, starboard home\". With some of these specious expansions, the \"belief\" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with \"gentlemen only, ladies forbidden\" for \"golf\", although many other (more credulous) people have uncritically taken it for fact. Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies: \"shit\" from \"ship/store high in transit\" or \"special high-intensity training\" and \"fuck\" from \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\", or \"fornication under consent/command of the king\".\n\nIn English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a full stop/period/point in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the colon and apostrophe have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. \"A. D.\"). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.\n\nSome influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of \"The Penguin Guide to Punctuation\", states categorically that, in British English, \"this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete\".\n\nNevertheless, some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances. For example, The New York Times' guide recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in \"K.G.B.\", but not when pronounced as a word, as in \"NATO\". The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.\n\nWhen a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. \"TV\", for example, may stand for a \"single\" word (\"television\" or \"transvestite\", for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although \"PS\" stands for the single word \"postscript\" (or the Latin \"postscriptum\"), it is often spelled with periods (\"P.S.\").\n\nThe slash ('/', or \"solidus\") is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in \"N/A\" (\"not applicable, not available\"), \"c/o\" (\"care of\") and \"w/o\" (\"without\").\n\nInconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, \"i18n\" abbreviates \"internationalization\", a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The \"18\" represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in \"internationalization\". \"Localization\" can be abbreviated \"l10n\", \"multilingualization\" \"m17n\", and \"accessibility\" \"a11y\". In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general \"x\" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include \"Crxn\" for \"crystallization\" and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment (\"hx\", \"dx\", \"tx\").\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\". The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so \"compact discs\" would be \"CDs\" or \"C.D.s\"), whereas \"The New York Times\" style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\").\n\nPossessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, \"the C.D.'s' labels\" (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is \"S\", as in \"SOS's\" (although abbreviations ending with S can also take \"-es\", e.g. \"SOSes\"), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.\n\nA particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is \"Member of Parliament\", which in plural is \"Members of Parliament\". It is possible then to abbreviate this as \"M's P.\" (or similar), as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley. This usage is less common than forms with \"s\" at the end, such as \"MPs\", and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, \"weapons of mass destruction\" becomes \"WMDs\", \"prisoners of war\" becomes \"POWs\", and \"runs batted in\" becomes \"RBIs\".\n\nThe argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, \"If \"D\" can stand for \"disc\", it can also stand for \"discs\") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, \"U.S.\" is short for \"United States, but not \"United State\". In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final \"s\" may seem awkward: for example, \"U.S.\", \"U.S.'s\", etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple attributive usage (for example, \"the U.S. economy\") or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and \"then\" making the possessive (for example, \"the United States' economy\"). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation \"United States's\" sometimes is used.\n\nAbbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as \"TV\" (\"television\")—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (\"two TVs\"); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (\"the TV's antenna\").\n\nThe most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase (all-caps), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words \"scuba\", \"laser\", and \"radar\"—these are known as \"anacronyms\". Anacronyms (note well \"-acro-\") should not be homophonously confused with anachronyms (note well \"-chron-\"), which are a type of misnomer.\n\nSmall caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"USA Today\", is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters; thus \"U.S.\" and \"FDR\" in normal caps, but \"\" in small caps. The acronyms \"AD\" and \"BC\" are often smallcapped as well, as in: \"From \".\n\nWords derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, \"pre-WWII politics\", \"post-NATO world\", \"DNAase\". In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.\n\nSome publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms \"Nato\" and \"Aids\" in mixed case, but the initialisms \"USA\" and \"FBI\" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in \"The Guardian\", and BBC News typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.\n\nSome style manuals also base the letters' case on their number. \"The New York Times\", for example, keeps \"NATO\" in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it \"Nato\"), but uses lower case in \"UNICEF\" (from \"United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of \"shouting capitals\").\n\nWhile abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words (such as \"and\", \"or\", \"of\", or \"to\"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles.) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL (Transport for London) and \"LotR\" (\"Lord of the Rings\"); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.\n\nNumbers (both cardinal and ordinal) in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters: as in \"4GL\" (Fourth generation language) or \"G77\" (Group of 77). Large numbers may use metric prefixes, as with \"Y2K\" for \"Year 2000\" (sometimes written \"Y2k\", because the SI symbol for 1000 is \"k\"—not \"K\", which stands for \"kelvin\"). Exceptions using initials for numbers include \"TLA\" (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and \"GoF\" (Gang of Four). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as \"W3C\" (\"World Wide Web Consortium\") and \"T3\" (\"Trends, Tips & Tools for Everyday Living\"); pronunciation, such as \"B2B\" (\"business to business\"); and numeronyms, such as \"i18n\" (\"internationalization\"; \"18\" represents the 18 letters between the initial \"i\" and the final \"n\").\n\nAlthough many authors of expository writing show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters. For example,\n\"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)\" or \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" in the final published article when following the AMA Manual of Style.\n\nSome apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as BBQ (bee-bee-cue), for \"barbecue\", or K9 (kay-nine) for \"canine\". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as \"orphan initialisms\"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. For example, the letters of the SAT, a US college entrance test originally dubbed \"Scholastic Aptitude Test\", no longer officially stand for anything.\n\nThis is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT&T, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.\n\nPseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets: for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated as \"IBM\" (for example, \"IBM Canada\") to avoid translating the full name into local languages. Likewise, \"UBS\" is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, and \"HSBC\" has replaced \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\" Sometimes, companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as TD Bank, just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada (a constitutional monarchy), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called RBC Bank.\n\nRebranding can lead to redundant acronym syndrome, as when Trustee Savings Bank became TSB Bank, or when Railway Express Agency became REA Express. A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows \"\" and \"Navy: NCIS\" (\"Navy\" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada's Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.\n\nAnother common example is \"RAM memory\", which is redundant because \"RAM\" (\"random-access memory\") includes the initial of the word \"memory\". \"PIN\" stands for \"personal identification number\", obviating the second word in \"PIN number\"; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word \"pin\". Other examples include \"ATM machine,\" \"EAB bank,\" \"CableACE Award,\" \"DC Comics,\" \"HIV virus,\" Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant \"SAT test,\" now simply \"SAT Reasoning Test\"). TNN (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself \"The New TNN\" for a brief interlude.\n\nSometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:\n\nA \"backronym\" (or \"bacronym\") is a phrase that is constructed \"after the fact\" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word \"book\" ought to stand for \"Box Of Organized Knowledge.\" A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.\n\nBackronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) \"A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men\".\n\nAcronyms are sometimes contrived, that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are \"USA PATRIOT\", \"CAN SPAM\", \"CAPTCHA\" and \"ACT UP\". The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as \"fcuk\", standing for \"French Connection United Kingdom.\" The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word \"fuck.\"\n\nThe US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including \"RESURRECT\", \"NIRVANA\", and \"DUDE\". In July 2010, Wired Magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to \"..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science\" named \"BATMAN\" and \"ROBIN\" for \"Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature\" and \"Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks\", a reference to the Batman and Robin comic-book superheroes.\n\nThe short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the raison d'être of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of \"cutesy\" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a cryptic and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).\n\nSome acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, \"Verliebt in Berlin\" (ViB), a German telenovela, was first intended to be \"Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)\", but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym \"ANAL\". Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as \"CLaIT\", rather than \"CLIT\". In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party) was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced \"see crap\"). (The satirical magazine \"Frank\" had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP.) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (GIT). The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as \"TNT\" and not \"TIT\". Technological Institute of Textile & Sciences is still known as TITS. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law (ASSOL) in honor of the late Antonin Scalia, only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.\n\nA macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word \"macronym\" is a portmanteau of \"macro-\" and \"acronym\".\n\nSome examples of macronyms are: \n\nSome macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine \"New Scientist\", a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the \"Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service\"; ATOVS is \"Advanced TOVS\"; TOVS is \"TIROS operational vertical sounder\"; and TIROS is \"Television infrared observational satellite\". Fully expanded, \"RARS\" might thus become \"Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service\". However, to say that \"RARS\" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that \"CHF\" can be usefully interchanged with \"congestive heart failure\"), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to \"spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations,\" but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words \"laser\" and \"radar\" function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as \"RARS\" and \"CHA2DS2–VASc score\" are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from \"Podospora anserine\"), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.\n\nA special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" as MUNG, which stands for \"MUNG Until No Good\".\n\nSome examples of recursive acronyms are:\n\nIn English language discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), \"acronyms\" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.\n\nFor example, in Chinese, \"university\" (/, literally \"great learning\") is usually abbreviated simply as (\"great\") when used with the name of the institute. So \"Peking University\" () is commonly shortened to ( \"north-great\") by also only taking the first character of \"Peking\", the \"northern capital\" (). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of \"Hong Kong University\" () uses \"Kong\" () rather than \"Hong\".\n\nThere are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), is \"Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the \"Communist Party of China\" part of its name through acronyms, then the \"Standing Committee\" part, again through acronyms, to create \"中共中央政治局常委\". Alternatively, it omitted the \"Communist Party\" part altogether, creating \"Politburo Standing Committee\" (政治局常委会), and eventually just \"Standing Committee\" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are \"Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply \"Changwei\" (常委), with the term \"Ruchang\" (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word \"全国人民代表大会\" (National People's Congress) can be broken into four parts: \"全国\" = \"the whole nation\", \"人民\" = \"people\", \"代表\" = \"representatives\", \"大会\" = \"conference\". Yet, in its short form \"人大\" (literally \"man/people big\"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part (\"全国\") and the third part (\"代表\") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term \"initialism\" is inapplicable.\n\nMany proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Year's Gala, whose full name is literally read as \"China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to \"Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply \"Chunwan\" (春晚). Along the same vein, \"Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai\" (中国中央电视台) was reduced to \"Yangshi\" (央视) in the mid-2000s.\n\nMany aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for \"big\" or \"great\" i.e. \"dae\" (), to refer to universities (; \"daehak,\" literally \"great learning\" although \"big school\" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as \"UPenn\" or \"Texas Tech.\"\n\nSome acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how Hongik University (, \"Hongik Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Hongdae\" (, \"Hong, the big [school]\" or \"Hong-U\") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education (, \"Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Gyowondae\" (교원대, \"Big Ed.\" or \"Ed.-U\"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (, \"Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon\") is referred to as KAIST (, \"Kaiseuteu\") in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, \"seukai\"), combining the first letter of their English names (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test (, \"Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom\") is shortened to \"Suneung\" (, \"S.A.\").\n\nThe Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.\n\nChinese-based words (Sino-Japanese vocabulary) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like for . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saikyō for 埼京, from , rather than Saitō.\n\nNon-Chinese foreign borrowings (gairaigo) are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in hiragana). For example, the \"Pokémon\" media franchise's name originally stood for \"pocket monsters\" ( → ), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and \"wāpuro\" stands for \"word processor\" ( → ).\n\nTo a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are \"Gestapo\" rather than \"GSP\" (for ', 'secret state police'); ' rather than \"FAK\" (for ', anti-aircraft gun); ' rather than \"KP\" (for ', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ' (for ', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of include ' (for ', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a mullet) and the mocking of Adolf Hitler's title as ' (\"\", Greatest General of all Times).\n\nIt is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): (for , the United States); (for , the Soviet Union); (for , Rishon LeZion); (for , the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is (\"Tzahal\", for , Israel Defense Forces). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign gershayim remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\", singular: , plural: ; \"squad commander\", masculine: , feminine: ).\n\nThere is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the \"Golkar\" political party stands for Partai \"Gol\"ongan \"Kar\"ya, \"Monas\" stands for \"\"Mo\"numen \"Nas\"ional\" (National Monument), the \"Angkot\" public transport stands for \"\"Ang\"kutan \"Kot\"a\" (city public transportation), \"warnet\" stands for \"\"war\"ung inter\"net\"\" (internet cafe), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial.\n\nThe capital's metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), \"Jabodetabek\", is another infamous acronym. This stands for \"Ja\"karta-\"Bo\"gor-\"De\"pok-\"Ta\"ngerang-\"Bek\"asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. \"Jalan Tol\" (Toll Road) \"Jagorawi\" (\"Ja\"karta-Bo\"gor\"-Ci\"awi\") and \"Purbaleunyi\" (\"Pur\"wakarta-\"Ba\"ndung-Ci\"leunyi\"), Joglo Semar (\"Jog\"ja-so\"lo\"-\"semar\"ang).\n\nIn some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets, many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI—\"Tentara Nasional Indonesia\") and Indonesian police (POLRI—\"Kepolisian Republik Indonesia\") are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the \"Kopassus\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan Khu\"sus\"; Special Forces Command), \"Kopaska\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan \"Ka\"tak; Frogmen Command), \"Kodim\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Di\"strik \"M\"iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's administrative divisions), \"Serka\" (\"Ser\"san \"K\"ep\"a\"la; Head Sergeant), \"Akmil\" (\"Ak\"ademi \"Mil\"iter; Military Academy—in Magelang) and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.\n\nHeavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of Bahasa Indonesia to seek information and news in Indonesian media.\n\nAcronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. (Gazprom), for (', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (\"SMI\", for ', means of mass informing, i.e. mass media). Another Russian acronym, (GULag) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for (\", Chief Administration of Camps).\n\nHistorically, OTMA was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\n\nIn Swahili, acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for \" (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.\n\nIn Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include \"TP.HCM\" (', Ho Chi Minh City), \"THPT\" (', high school), \"CLB\" (', club), \"CSDL\" (', database), \"NXB\" (', publisher), \"ÔBACE\" (', a general form of address), and \"CTTĐVN\" (', Vietnamese Martyrs). Longer examples include \"CHXHCNVN\" (', Socialist Republic of Vietnam) and \"MTDTGPMNVN\" (\"\", Viet Cong). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam. It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.\n\nEach letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example \"ĐNA\" or \"ĐNÁ\" for \"\" (Southeast Asia) and \"LMCA\" or \"LMCÂ\" for \"Liên minh châu Âu\" (European Union). The letter \"Ư\" is often replaced by \"W\" in initialisms to avoid confusion with \"U\", for example \"UBTWMTTQVN\" or \"UBTƯMTTQVN\" for \"Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam\" (Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front).\n\nInitialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ' (), a respelling of the French acronym \"SIDA\" (AIDS); ' (), a literal reading of the English initialism for Voice of America; and \"NASA\" (), borrowed directly from the English acronym.\n\nAs in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of \"Việt Nam\" (Vietnam) and \"Cộng sản\" (communist). This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.\n\nIn languages where nouns are declined, various methods are used. An example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:\nThe process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus \"pre-NATO policy\" (rather than \"preNATO\").\n\nIn languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish, where lenition (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case \"h\" is added after the initial consonant; for example, \"BBC Scotland\" in the genitive case would be written as \"BhBC Alba\", with the acronym pronounced \"VBC\". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for \"television\" (\"gd: telebhisean\") is \"TBh\", pronounced \"TV\", as in English.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "192230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192230", "title": "Almanac", "text": "Almanac\n\nAn almanac (also spelled \"almanack\" and \"almanach\") is an annual publication listing a set of events forthcoming in the next year.\n\nIt includes information like weather forecasts, farmers' planting dates, tide tables, and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar. Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon, dates of eclipses, hours of high and low tides, and religious festivals.\n\nA calendar, which is a system for time keeping, in written form is usually produced as a most simple almanac: it includes additional information about the day of the week on which a particular day falls, major holidays, the phases of the moon, earthquake hazard levels etc. The set of events noted in an almanac are selected in view of a more or less specific group of readers e.g. farmers, sailors, astronomers or others.\n\nThe etymology of the word is unclear. It is suggested the word \"almanac\" derives from a Greek word meaning \"calendar\". However, that word appears only once in antiquity, by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts (\"almenichiaká\"). The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural, astronomical, or meteorological data. But it is highly unlikely Roger Bacon received the word from this etymology: \"Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word (of which however the real form is very uncertain), the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the Spanish Arabic manākh, or with Medieval Latin almanach without Arabic intermediation, seem insurmountable.\"\n\nThe earliest documented use of the word in any language is in Latin in 1267 by Roger Bacon, where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the moon.\n\nOne etymology report says \"The ultimate source of the word is obscure. Its first syllable, al-, and its general relevance to medieval science and technology, strongly suggest an Arabic origin, but no convincing candidate has been found\". Another report similarly says of \"almanac\": \"First seen in Roger Bacon. Apparently from Spanish Arabic, \"al-manakh\", but this is not an Arabic word...The word remains a puzzle.\" The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" similarly says \"the word has no etymon in Arabic\" but indirect circumstantial evidence \"points to a Spanish Arabic \"al-manākh\"\".\n\nThe reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled \"al-manākh\" is that the spelling occurred as \"almanach\", as well as almanac (and Roger Bacon used both spellings). The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars.\n\nThe prestige of the Tables of Toledo and other medieval Arabic astronomy works at the time of the word's emergence in the West, together with the absence of the word in Arabic, suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo-Arabic. At that time in the West, it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables. Also around that time, prompted by that motive, the Latin writer Pseudo-Geber wrote under an Arabic pseudonym. (The later alchemical word \"alkahest\" is known to be pseudo-Arabic.)\n\nThe earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the Near East, dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC. They have been called generally hemerologies, from the Greek \"hēmerā\", meaning \"day\". Among them is the so-called Babylonian Almanac, which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them. Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found. Egyptian lists of good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events. The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries the date was drifting in the calendar. The first heliacal rising of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice, the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread.\n\nThe Greek almanac, known as parapegma, has existed in the form an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes, hence the name. There were also written texts and according to Diogenes Laërtius, \"Parapegma\" was the title of a book by Democritus. Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer (2nd century) wrote a treatise, \"Phaseis\"—\"phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes\" is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a \"parapegma\", a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes, first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset, and solar events such as solstices, all organized according to the solar year. With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena, composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past. \"Parapegmata\" had been composed for centuries.\n\nPtolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather; his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play. Hence for him, weather prediction was a special division of astrology.\n\nThe origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient Babylonian astronomy, when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena. Similar treatises called Zij were later composed in medieval Islamic astronomy.\n\nThe modern almanac differs from Babylonian, Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that \"the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation\", in contrast to the more common \"auxiliary astronomical tables\" based on Ptolemy's \"Almagest\". The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the \"Almanac of Azarqueil\" written in 1088 by Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī (Latinized as Arzachel) in Toledo, al-Andalus. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A Latin translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the \"Tables of Toledo\" in the 12th century and the \"Alfonsine tables\" in the 13th century.\nAfter almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the divination sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes, as well as the more concrete information. In 1150 Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern almanacs. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, Petrus de Dacia created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford). This was the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his as well. In 1327 Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which was continued in print for several centuries in many editions. In 1497 the \"Sheapheard’s Kalendar\", translated from French (Richard Pynson) became the first English printed almanac.\n\nBy the second half of the 16th century, yearly almanacs were being produced in England by men such as Anthony Askham, Thomas Buckminster, John Dade and Gabriel Frende. In the 17th century, English almanacs were bestsellers, second only to the Bible; by the middle of the century, 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually (a complete listing can be found in the English Short Title Catalogue). Until its deregulation in 1775, the Stationers' Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England. Richard Allestree (who is not the same as this Richard Allestree) wrote one of the more popular English almanacs, producing yearly volumes from 1617 to 1643, but his is by no means the earliest or the longest-running almanac.\n\nIn British America, William Pierce of Harvard College published the first American almanac entitled, \"An Almanac for New England for the year 1639\" Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard became the first center for the annual publication of almanacs with various editors including Samuel Danforth, Oakes, Cheever, Chauncey, Dudley, Foster, et alia. An almanac maker going under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island began to publish \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" one of the first comic almanacs that parodied these horoscopes in its 1664 issue, saying \"This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom.\" Other noteworthy comic almanacs include those published from 1687-1702 by John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut.\n\nThe most important early American almanacs were made from 1726-1775 by Nathaniel Ames of Dedham, Massachusetts. A few years later James Franklin began publishing the Rhode-Island Almanack beginning in 1728. Five years later his brother Benjamin Franklin began publishing \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" from 1733-1758. Benjamin Banneker, a free African American, composed a series of almanacs from 1792-1797.\n\nCurrently published almanacs such as \"Whitaker's Almanack\" have expanded their scope and contents beyond that of their historical counterparts. Modern almanacs include a comprehensive presentation of statistical and descriptive data covering the entire world. Contents also include discussions of topical developments and a summary of recent historical events. Other currently published almanacs (ca. 2006) include \"TIME Almanac with Information Please\", \"World Almanac and Book of Facts\", \"The Farmer's Almanac\" and \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" and The Almanac for Farmers & City Folk. The \"Inverness Almanac\" ,\" an almanac/literary journal, was published in West Marin, California, from 2015 to 2016. In 2007, Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine launched a Canadian Almanac, written in Canada, with all-Canadian content. The nonprofit agrarian organization the Greenhorns currently publishes \"The New Farmer's Almanac\" as a resource for young farmers.\n\nMajor topics covered by almanacs (reflected by their tables of contents) include: geography, government, demographics, agriculture, economics and business, health and medicine, religion, mass media, transportation, science and technology, sport, and awards/prizes.\n\nOther examples include \"The Almanac of American Politics\" published by Columbia Books & Information Services, \"The Almanac of American Literature\", and \"The Almanac of British Politics\".\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, approximately 53 per cent of all almanac sales sold in the United States were sold through the \"Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985)\" computer game pack that included a complimentary \"World Almanac and Book of Facts.\"\n\nThe GPS almanac, as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the GPS almanac provide a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.\n\n\n\n"}

One educational technique when analyzing prose literature is to have students or teachers circle the names of characters and put rectangular boxes around phrases identifying the setting of a given scene.\n\nAnnotated bibliographies add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.\n\nFrom a cognitive perspective annotation has an important role in learning and instruction. As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners' attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images). This is especially important when experts, such as medical doctors, interpret visualizations in detail and explain their interpretations to others, for example by means of digital technology. Here, annotation can be a way to establish common ground between interactants with different levels of knowledge. The value of annotation has been empirically confirmed, for example, in a study which shows that in computer-based teleconsultations the integration of image annotation and speech leads to significantly improved knowledge exchange compared with the use of images and speech without annotation.\n\nMarkup languages like XML and HTML annotate text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text. They can be used to add information about the desired visual presentation, or machine-readable semantic information, as in the semantic web.\n\nThe \"annotate\" function (also known as \"blame\" or \"praise\") used in source control systems such as Git, Team Foundation Server and Subversion determines who committed changes to the source code into the repository. This outputs a copy of the source code where each line is annotated with the name of the last contributor to edit that line (and possibly a revision number). This can help establish blame in the event a change caused a malfunction, or identify the author of brilliant code.\n\nA special case is the Java programming language, where annotations can be used as a special form of syntactic metadata in the source code. Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages may be annotated. The annotations can be embedded in class files generated by the compiler and may be retained by the Java virtual machine and thus influence the run-time behaviour of an application. It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.\n\nSince the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it.\n\nIn the digital imaging community the term annotation is commonly used for visible metadata superimposed on an image without changing the underlying master image, such as sticky notes, virtual laser pointers, circles, arrows, and black-outs (cf. redaction).\n\nIn the medical imaging community, an annotation is often referred to as a region of interest and is encoded in DICOM format.\n\nIn the United States, legal publishers such as Thomson West and Lexis Nexis publish annotated versions of statutes, providing information about court cases that have interpreted the statutes. Both the federal United States Code and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the courts, and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in legal research.\n\nIn linguistics, annotations include comments and metadata; these non-transcriptional annotations are also non-linguistic. A collection of texts with linguistic annotations is known as a corpus (plural \"corpora\"). The Linguistic Annotation Wiki describes tools and formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations.\n\n"}

The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as where an \"apple\" is faulted for not being a good \"orange\".\n\nThe idiom is not unique to English. In Quebec French, it may take the form \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears). In Latin American Spanish, it is usually \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all varieties of Spanish \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and pears are compared in Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovene, Luxembourgish, Serbian, and Turkish. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is \"sumar peras con manzanas\", that is, \"to add pears and apples\"; the same thing applies in Italian (\"sommare le mele con le pere\") and Romanian (\"a aduna merele cu perele\"). In Portuguese, the expression is \"comparar laranjas com bananas\" (compare orange to banana). In Czech, the idiom \"míchat jablka s hruškami\" literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.\n\nSome languages use completely different items, such as the Serbian \"Поредити бабе и жабе\" (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the Romanian \"baba şi mitraliera\" (the grandmother and the machine gun); \"vaca şi izmenele\" (the cow and the longjohns); or \"țiganul şi carioca\" (the gypsy and the marker), or the Welsh \"mor wahanol â mêl a menyn\" (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent Danish idiom, \"Hvad er højest, Rundetårn eller et tordenskrald?\" means \"What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?\", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In Russian, the phrase \"сравнивать тёплое с мягким\" (to compare warm and soft) is used. In Argentina, a common question is \"¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?\" (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in Colombia, a similar (though more rude) version is common: \"confundir la mierda con la pomada\" (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression \"co ma piernik do wiatraka?\" is used, meaning \"What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?\". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning \"horses and cattles won't mate with each other\", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.\n\nA number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, \"oranges with orangutans\", \"apples with dishwashers\", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.\n\nSometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian \"merele cu perele\" (apples and pears) and the Hungarian \"szezont a fazonnal\" (the season with the fashion).\n\nAt least two tongue-in-cheek scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.\n\nThe first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center, used infrared spectroscopy to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\", concluded: \"[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future.\"\n\nA second study, written by Stamford Hospital's surgeon-in-chief James Barone and published in the \"British Medical Journal,\" noted that the phrase \"apples and oranges\" was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing \"Desflurane and propofol\" and \"Salmeterol and ipratropium\" with \"apples and oranges\". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in orchards, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of seeds (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of Johnny Appleseed, and color.\n\nThe \"Annals of Improbable Research\" subsequently noted that the \"earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment\" than the \"British Medical Journal\" study.\n\nOn April Fools' Day 2014, \"The Economist\" compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be \"unrelated variables\".\n\nWhile references to comparing apples and oranges are often a rhetorical device, references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to \"add apples and oranges\" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra.\n\nThe admonition is really more of a mnemonic, since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension \"fruit\"; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.\n\n"}

It is based on the page numbers used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences edition of the complete works of Aristotle and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical philologist August Immanuel Bekker (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name Berlin numbering or Berlin pagination.\n\nBekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition). For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is \"1094a1\", which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1.\n\nAll modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers. Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.\n\nWhile Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, Catholic or Thomist scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to the works of Plato, and Diels-Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the \"Corpus Aristotelicum\" regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.\n\nThe following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation. Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.\n\nThe \"Constitution of the Athenians\" (or \"Athenaiōn Politeia\") was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the British Museum. The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.\n\nSurviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by Valentin Rose. These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of Aristotle was \"Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus\" (1863). As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the Teubner series, \"Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta\", Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by \"R\"), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in Walter de Gruyter's reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by Eckart Schütrumpf is in preparation.\n\nFor a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, \"Select Fragments\" (Oxford 1952), and Jonathan Barnes (ed.), \"The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation\", vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp. 2384–2465.\n\nThe works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues \"On Philosophy\" (or \"On the Good\"), \"Eudemus\" (or \"On the Soul\"), \"On Justice\", and \"On Good Birth\". The possibly spurious work, \"On Ideas\" survives in quotations by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary on Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\". For the dialogues, see also the editions of Richard Rudolf Walzer, \"Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum\" (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, \"Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi\" (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.\n\n"}

The citation dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2–3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several orders of magnitude. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on preferential attachment. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.\n\nThe dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to technological progress, the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the citation dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the reference list of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.\n\nIt has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted power-law.

Kennedy's assassination in 1963. From the early 1980s through 2004 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted about 2,500 analyses on cases submitted by law-enforcement groups. The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the United States National Academy of Science's Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy to research the scientific merit of the process.\n\nIn 2004 the Board's study was summarized in \"Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence.\" The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used plasma-optical emission spectroscopy to identify trace elements in the bullets). The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation. The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations. The greatest caveat in the report was that the statistical tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury. Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution. This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.\n\n\"CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt\" examined the unreliability of this technique. It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.\n\nThe U.S. government has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to false convictions.

It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.\n\nOver many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain lesions on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use. Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of procedural learning in human and nonhuman animals alike.\n\nCurrently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.\n\nThe comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills. Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.\n\nComparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition. Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with brain-damaged patients.\n\nWithin the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.\n\nComparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations. Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample. These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients. The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.\n\nGeorge Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career. Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys, and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate ablation. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist Colin Blakemore and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy. Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.\n\n\n"}

It is closely related to evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford Ladd Prosser, \"Comparative Physiology\nis not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy.\"\n\nOriginally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the Krogh Principle.\n\nC. Ladd Prosser, a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in Garland and Carter):\n\n1. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.\n\n2. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of organisms.\n\n3. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.\n\n4. To identify \"model systems\" for studying particular physiological functions.\n\n5. To use the \"kind of animal\" as an experimental variable.\n\nComparative physiologists often study organisms that live in \"extreme\" environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation. One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.\n\nSimilarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to \"unusual\" organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter, hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of blood pressure. More generally, ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base balance and pH change as body temperature changes.\n\nIn the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\nA number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology, including:\n\nKnut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke University for many years and training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.\n\nGrover C. Stephens (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University of Minnesota until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the University of California at Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field (obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11797804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11797804", "title": "Comparison (grammar)", "text": "Comparison (grammar)\n\nComparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages, whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The comparative expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the superlative is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.\n\nThe grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the \"positive\", which simply denotes a property (as with the English words \"big\" and \"fully\"); the \"comparative\", which indicates \"greater degree (as \"bigger\" and \"more fully\"); and the \"superlative\", which indicates \"greatest degree (as \"biggest\" and \"most fully\"). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. \"beautiful\", \"less beautiful\", \"least beautiful\".\n\nThe comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the \"-er\" suffix or modifying word \"more\" or \"less\" (e.g., \"faster\", \"more intelligent\", \"less wasteful\"); it can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., \"more men than women\"). One preposition, \"near\", also has a superlative form, as in \"Find the restaurant nearest your house\".\n\nComparatives and superlatives may be formed morphologically, by inflection, as with the English and German \"-er\" and \"-(e)st\" forms, or syntactically, as with the English \"more...\" and \"most...\" and the French \"plus...\" and \"le plus...\" forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as \"better\" and \"best\" (from \"good\") and \"less\" and \"least\" (from \"little/few\") in English, and \"meilleur\" (from \"bon\") and \"mieux\" (from the adverb \"bien\") in French.\n\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n\nComparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with \"than\" in English, \"als\" in German, etc. In Russian and Greek (Ancient, Koine and Modern) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in \"the best swimmer out of all the girls\".\n\nLanguages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include \"as... as\" and \"less/least...\".\n\nА few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is Bulgarian, where expressions like \"по̀ човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)\" (literally \"more person\", \"most person\", \"less person\" but normally \"better kind of a person\", \"best kind of person\", \"not that good kind of a person\") and \"по̀ обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)\" (\"I like more\", \"I like the least\") are quite usual.\n\nIn many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, \"May the better man win\" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form \"May the best man win\" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.\n\nIn some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes considered ungrammatical.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnglish has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs \"more\" and \"most\".\n\nAs a general rule, words with one syllable require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require \"more\" or \"most\", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, \"e.g.\" 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.\n\nMorphological comparison uses the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"). These inflections are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -\"ior\" and -\"issimus\" and Ancient Greek -\"īōn\" and -\"istos\". They are typically added to shorter words, words of Anglo-Saxon origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these inflections have fewer than three syllables.\n\nThis system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like \"good\", \"better\", and \"best\", contain suppletive forms. These irregular forms include:\n\nThe second system of comparison in English appends the grammatical particles \"more\" and \"most\", themselves the irregular comparatives of \"many\" and \"much\", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the diminutives \"less\" and \"least\".\n\nThis system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than \"-ly\" (e.g., \"beautiful\"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:\n\nSome adjectives, the absolute or ungradable adjectives do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either \"present\" or \"absent\", such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything \"very Cretaceous\", or to characterize something as \"more igneous\" than something else.\n\nSome grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as \"full\", \"complete\", \"unique\", or \"empty\", which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute. However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nMany prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as \"more perfect\", \"most unique\", and \"most parallel\" as illogical pleonasms: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be \"very unique\", or \"more unique\" than something else.\n\nOther style guides argue that terms like \"perfect\" and \"parallel\" never apply \"exactly\" to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean \"nearly perfect\", \"nearly parallel\", and so on; in this sense, \"more perfect\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and \"more parallel\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.\n\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.\n\nIn Bulgarian, comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics \"по-\" (\"more\") and \"най-\" (\"most\"):\n\nIn Czech, Polish, Slovak and Slovene, comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).\n\nIn Russian, comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:\n\nIn contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. \"the most beautiful\") and absolute (e.g. \"very beautiful\").\n\nFrench: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (\"mon\", \"ton\", \"son\", etc.), before \"plus\" or \"moins\" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: \"Elle est la plus belle femme\" → (she is the most beautiful woman); \"Cette ville est la moins chère de France\" → (this town is the least expensive in France); \"C'est sa plus belle robe\" → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix \"-issime\" but only with certain words, for example: \"C'est un homme richissime\" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.\n\nPortuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative \"(superlativo relativo)\" and absolute superlative \"(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).\nFor the comparative superlative they use the words \"mais\" and \"più\" between the article and the adjective, like \"most\" in English.\nFor the absolute superlative they either use \"muito\"/\"molto\" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding \"issimo\" (singular masculine), \"issima\" (singular feminine), \"íssimos\"/\"issimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íssimas\"/\"issime\" (plural feminine). For example:\nThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in \"-re\" and \"-le\" (deriving from Latin words ending in \"-er\" and \"-ilis\") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending \"-re\" and they gain the endings \"errimo\" (singular masculine), \"errima\" (singular feminine), \"érrimos\"/\"errimi\" (plural masculine), or \"érrimas\"/\"errime\" (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the \"-l\"/\"-le\" ending and gain \"ílimo\"/\"illimo\" (singular masculine), \"ílima\"/\"illima\" (singular feminine), \"ílimos\"/\"illimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íli\nRomanian, similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word \"mai\" before the adjective, which operates like \"more\" or \"-er\" in English. For example: \"luminos\" → bright, \"mai luminos\" → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word \"puțin\" (little) is added between \"mai\" and the adjective, for example \"mai puțin luminos\" → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant \"cel\" precedes \"mai,\" conjugated as \"cel / cei\" for male singular / plural and \"cea / cele\" for female singular / plural. For example: \"cea mai luminoasă stea\" → the brightest star; \"cele mai frumoase fete\" → the most beautiful girls; \"cel mai mic morcov\" → the smallest carrot.\n\nScottish Gaelic: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an \"e\" to the end and \"i\" before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by \"nas\" to say \"more,\" and \"as\" to say \"most.\" (The word \"na\" is used to mean \"than\".) Adjectives that begin with \"f\" are lenited. and \"as\" use different syntax constructions. For example:\nTha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.\" → I am taller than my sisters.\nIs mi as àirde.\" → I am the tallest.\n\nAs in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.\n\nIn other tenses, \"nas\" is replaced by \"na bu\" and \"as\" by \"a bu,\" both of which lenite the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an \"f\" followed by a vowel, the word \"bu\" is reduced to \"b\"'. For example:\n\n\nWelsh is similar to English in many respects. The ending \"-af\" is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English \"-est\", and with (most) long words \"mwyaf\" precedes it, as in the English \"most\". Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular. Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative \"must\" be used, e.g. of two people - \"John ydy'r talaf\" (John is the tallest).\n\nIn Akkadian cuneiform, (on a 12 paragraph clay tablet), from the time period of the 1350 BC Amarna letters (a roughly 20-year body of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral \"10,\" as well as \"7 and 7.\" The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.\n\nThe term \"7 and 7\" means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds \"more\" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, \"Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):\" \"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times\" more, \"...\". The word 'more' is Akkadian \"mila\", and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is \"...over and over again, overflowing,\" (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).\n\nThe numeral 10 is used for \"ten times greater\" in EA 19, \"Love and Gold\", one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-(Amenhotep IV-\"Akhenaton\"). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):\n\nThe actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, \"to light up, to rise\"), uses: -e-le-né-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: \"...may it be, flourish-our (relations).\"\n\nIn Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with \"kõige\" followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of \"sinine\" 'blue' is \"sinisem\" and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is \"kõige sinisem\". There is also a synthetic (\"short\") superlative form, which is formed by adding \"-m\" to the end of the plural partitive case. For \"sinine\" the plural partitive form is \"siniseid\" and so \"siniseim\" is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the \"kõige\"-form, has a lot of exceptions.\n\n"}

The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of intellectual property, providing employment and entertainment for billions of people around the world.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was introduced as in 1966 that lasted three years. \"\" commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes. With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, \"Star Trek\" grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Wars\" was introduced as a feature film, \"A New Hope\" (1977). A novelization titled \"\", based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, \"Star Wars\" quickly grew into a popular media franchise.\n\n\"Star Trek\" debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western \"Wagon Train\" and the adventure stories of Horatio Hornblower, but evolved into an idealistic, utopian prospect of future human society. Inspired by \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Star Trek\"s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. \"Star Trek\" occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional time travel and interdimensional travel. The Earth of the \"Star Trek\" universe shares most of its history with the real world.\n\n\"Star Wars\" debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. \"Star Wars\" mainly belongs to the space opera subgenre of science fiction that follows The Hero's Journey and was inspired by works such as Beowulf, King Arthur and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history. It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. \"Star Wars\" is set \"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away\", although many characters are human, occasionally use Earth metaphors and exhibit human character traits.\n\nAlthough both \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. \"Star Wars\" has not produced any live-action television series while \"Star Trek\" has produced seven live-action television series.\n\n\"Star Trek\" likewise has not produced any television films; whereas \"Star Wars\" has produced at least three live-action television films outside the \"Star Wars\" film saga. The \"Star Wars Holiday Special\", \"\" and \"\" are all live-action television spin-off films set in the \"Star Wars\" universe, but not considered part of the official \"Star Wars canon\".\n\n\nAside from both having the word \"star\" in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the space western subgenre.\n\nBoth stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in \"Star Trek\" consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the United Federation of Planets. \"Star Wars\" depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the Old Republic, inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the Galactic Empire and was again later reformed into a new society called the New Republic after a series of wars.\n\nBoth franchises promote philosophical and political messages.\n\nThe primary philosophies of \"Star Trek\" convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by morality tales such as \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nThe primary philosophical messages of \"Star Wars\" are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another. \"Star Wars\" preaches against totalitarian systems and favors societies that offer equality. In an interview on the \"Star Wars\" 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Patrick Stewart stated \"A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of \"Star Wars\" is a very very positive one.\"\n\nThere have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as \"The Outer Limits\" and \"Seaquest\".\n\nBoth franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including Greco-Roman mythology. Many planets and alien species in \"Star Trek\", for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various \"Star Trek\" television series, such as \"Who Mourns for Adonais\", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings. The series also make references to Ancient Babylon and its mythic folklore. The Klingons and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century Mongols.\n\nMuch of \"Star Wars\" story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including classical Greece and Rome, such as the fall of the Old Republic in \"Star Wars\", followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire, which parallels the fall of the ancient Roman Republic followed by the rise of the Roman Empire.\n\nA 1983 documentary on the making of \"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.\n\nJ. J. Abrams, director and producer of \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and producer of \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016), directed and produced \"\" (2015). \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as Simon Pegg starred in both series.\n\n\"\" (2002) was poorly received and \"\" (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.\n\nThe newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the United Arab Emirates. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, while scenes for cities in the film \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nThe two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include canonical and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.\n\nDespite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the \"Star Wars\" film series exceed the profit of the \"Star Trek\" film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.\n\nScience fiction writer David Brin criticized \"Star Wars\" at the time of the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", arguing that while the \"Star Wars\" movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with \"Star Wars\" and George Lucas, whom he accused of \"having an agenda\", is that the \"Star Wars\" galaxy is too \"elitist\", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the Galactic Civil War as part of the \"same genetically superior royal family\". He finds the \"Star Wars\" universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that Luke Skywalker killing Palpatine would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.\n\nAmong the many other flaws he sees with \"Star Wars\" is that Anakin Skywalker becomes a hero in the ending of \"Return of the Jedi\" simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, \"Star Trek\" is \"democratic\" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.\n\nWilliam Shatner argues that \"Star Trek\" is superior to \"Star Wars\". According to him, \"\"Star Trek\" had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions.\" Shatner believes that \"Star Wars\" was only better than \"Star Trek\" in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, \"Star Trek\" was able to \"supersede \"Star Wars\" on every level\".\n\nTim Russ, who played Tuvok on \"\", claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that \"Star Trek\" reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. \"Star Wars\" in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the Eastern philosophy of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, \"Star Trek\" comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in \"our\" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas \"Star Wars\" takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.\n\nJeremy Bulloch is best known for his role as Boba Fett in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. He is a huge fan of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". He argued that while both franchises are popular, \"Star Wars\" comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.\n\nContrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of \"The New York Times\" argued, \"\"Trek\" fandom revolves around technology because the \"Star Trek\" universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and \"Gong Show\"-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in \"Star Wars\" is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because \"Star Wars\" isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.\"\n\nJohn Wenzel of \"The Denver Post\" highlighted two differences in approach, noting the \"swashbuckling\" and \"gunslinger\" style of \"Star Wars\" compared with \"Star Trek\"s \"broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity\" and that the spiritual aspect of \"Star Wars\" contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in \"Star Trek\".\n\nBillionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd \"I'm a capitalist. \"Star Wars\" is the capitalist show. \"Star Trek\" is the communist one\". He further stated \"There is no money in \"Star Trek\" because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of \"Star Wars\" starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in \"Star Wars\" is driven by money.\"\n\nArchived footage in \"Trek Nation\" showed Gene Roddenberry saying, \"I like \"Star Wars\". It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun.\"\n\nThe two franchises have a \"symbiotic relationship\" stated Shatner, who credits \"Star Wars\" for launching the \"Star Trek\" films. He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 \"Star Trek\" fan convention in Las Vegas by stating \"\"Star Wars\" created \"Star Trek\"\". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film (\"A New Hope\"), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A \"Star Trek\" relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to \"Star Trek\". \"It was \"Star Wars\" that thrust \"Star Trek\" into the people of Paramount's consciousness\" Shatner stated.\n\nThe documentary \"Trek Nation\" features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that \"Star Trek\" was an influence while writing the original screenplay for \"Star Wars\". He explained that while both franchises were so \"far out\", \"Star Trek\" produced a fanbase that \"softened up the entertainment arena\" so that \"Star Wars\" could \"come along and stand on its shoulders.\" This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call \"Star Wars\" a \"derivative\" of \"Star Trek\".\n\nA few references to \"Star Wars\" have been inserted into \"Star Trek\" films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from \"Star Wars\" in both \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). Some \"Star Trek\" films and television episodes used the \"Star Wars\" animation shop, Industrial Light & Magic, for their special effects.\n\nWhen Roddenberry was honored at a \"Star Trek\" convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as Darth Vader. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of \"Star Wars\" and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.\n\nWilliam Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.\n\nAt a live concert, Shatner dressed as an imperial stormtrooper singing \"Girl Crush\" alongside Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.\n\nIn 2011, Shatner and Carrie Fisher posted a series of humorous YouTube videos satirizing each other's franchises.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that Captain Kirk and Princess Leia eloping and running off into the sunset would be the \"perfect union\" between \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\".\n\nShatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his Twitter account mocking \"Star Wars\". Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". It was then that \"Star Wars\" actor Peter Mayhew posted a \"retaliation\" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of \"\", another poorly received film.\n\nBoth franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the \"Star Trek\" reboot (2009), which was followed by \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled \"\", serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on CBS All Access, an online streaming platform, in 2017.\n\n\"Star Wars\" picked up from where \"Return of the Jedi\" left off, with \"\" the first in the new trilogy, and \"\" following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of \"Star Wars Rebels\", a television series set in between the \"Star Wars\" prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone \"Star Wars\" films, starting with \"Rogue One\", which was released in December 2016, and \"\" following in May 2018.\n\nAside from official works by the producers of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\", many fan films and webisodes set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered canon in relation to either franchise.\n\n"}

In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often scripted or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA. \nProfessional wrestling could be considered a performance art which combines athletics with theatrical performance. Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of amateur wrestling, striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a \"worked\" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century Europe as a carnival attraction.\n\nMixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including wrestling, boxing and Martial Arts, such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The early 1990s saw the Ultimate Fighting Championship popularize the term \"Mixed Martial Arts\", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.\n\nPossibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is Brock Lesnar, who has won the world championships in both the WWE and UFC. Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include Bobby Lashley (Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship as well as the Impact Global Championship), and Dan Severn who won the UFC Superfight Championship, and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nSince MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession.

{"id": "16759434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16759434", "title": "Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions", "text": "Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions\n\nBetween December 1911 and January 1912, both Roald Amundsen (leading his South Pole expedition) and Robert Falcon Scott (leading the Terra Nova Expedition) reached the South Pole within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.\n\nThe outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.\n\nHistorically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed, including:\n\nSullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive. he states \"Man is a poor beast of burden, as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.\"\n\nScott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective (\"The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition\" – Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole (\"The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object\" – Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to Cherry-Garrard.\n\nAmundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909. Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under Kristian Prestrud who conducted an expedition to King Edward VII Land while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.\n\nAmundsen camped on the Ross Ice Shelf at the Bay of Whales which is 60 miles (96 km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350 miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.\nScott's base was at Cape Evans on Ross Island, with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.\nConsequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.\n\nThe major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport —dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three \"motor sledges\". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander Reginald William Skelton who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant E.R.G.R. \"Teddy\" Evans as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition. Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost. One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.\n\nScott had used dogs on his first (Discovery) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.\n\nScott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his Nimrod expedition that got to within of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the Beardmore Glacier (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of William Speirs Bruce in his Arctic, Antarctic, and Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, Amundsen in the \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition, Fridtjof Nansen's crossing of Greenland, Robert Peary's three attempts at the North Pole, Eivind Astrup's work supporting Peary, Frederick Cook's discredited North Pole expedition, and Otto Sverdrup's explorations of Ellesmere Island. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take \"dogs, dogs and more dogs\".\n\nAt the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport. Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives. He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.' On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'. But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed \"reluctance\" to use dogs in this way: \"One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions.\"\n\nAmundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach. Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves. He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse. Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they \"also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal\". The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.\n\nAmundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the Inuit while on his \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.\n\nWhat Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.\n\nScott took the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18 km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.\n\nScott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that \"Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event\".\n\nAmundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, Olav Bjaaland, as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the South Pole.\n\nScott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were short of One-Ton Depot, which was from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team. Scott also blamed \"a prolonged blizzard\". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a \"normal\" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.\n\nDuring depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn. In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.\n\nScott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.)\n\nApsley Cherry-Garrard in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.\n\nScott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., Wilson's trip with Cherry-Garrard and Bowers to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.\n\nSince the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of scurvy.\n\nScott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.\n\nDehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.\n\nIt has been said (by the present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.\n\nAmundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.\n\nScott's team suffered regularly from snow blindness and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the \"day\" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the \"night\" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.\n\nIn 1921, 'Teddy' Evans wrote in his book \"South with Scott\" that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.\n\nHe did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.\n\nHe continued his instructions in the next paragraph \"You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised.\" with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.\n\nExpedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book \"The Worst Journey in the World\". However, in the 1948 preface to his book, he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and Edward Atkinson reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January. Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote \"In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\".\n\nOn 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some to the south, and in urgent need of rescue. Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.\n\nAtkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to \"use his judgement\" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.\n\nOn the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes \"We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.\" By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: \"The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble.\"\n\nAround 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing \"We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.\" (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.)\n\n"}

This mark is placed between the last two letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\" in singular is \",\" hence the plural \"\"). Acronyms can be formed from strings of single initial letters, e.g. \"\" pazátsta (for ), or multiple initial letters, e.g. (for , the Holy Land) or ráshlats (for , Rishon LeZion).\n\nIf the acronym is read as is, then the spelling should be with a final form letter. If, on the other hand, the acronym is read as the complete phrase or read as the individual letters, then it should be spelled with a medial form letter. In practice, this rule is more often than not ignored, and the acronyms spelled either way.\n\nAbbreviations that are truncations of a single word, consisting of the first letter or first several letters of that word (as opposed to acronyms formed from initials or truncations of more than one word) are denoted using the punctuation mark geresh () by placing the sign after the last letter of the abbreviation (e.g. \"Ms.\": \"\"). However, in practice, single and double quotes are often used instead of the special punctuation marks (for which most keyboards do not have keys), with the single quote used both in acronyms and abbreviations.\n\nOften (and especially when they describe a noun), Hebrew acronyms are pronounced by the insertion of a vowel sound (usually ) between the letters. These vowels often appear in transliterations to other scripts. Examples include Shas (), Tanakh () and Shabak (). There are exceptions to the use of \"a\", such as Etzel ().\n\nWhen one of the letters is vav or yud, these may be read as vowels (\"u\"/“o” and \"i\") instead: (\"duakh\"/\"dokh\" = , judgement and account); (\"admor\" = , hasidic rebbe; (\"shut\" = , questions and answers); (\"sakum\" = , knife spoon and fork); (\"tapuz\" = , orange, lit. golden apple); (\"um\" = , the United Nations); Bilu; Lehi. (An exception is , Beitar, pronounced \"beytar\".)\n\nHebrew numbers (e.g. year numbers in the Hebrew calendar) are written the same way as acronyms, with gershayim before the last character, but pronounced as separate letter names. For example,  (5775 AM, or 2014-2015 CE) is pronounced hei-tav-shin-ayin-hei.\n\nAcronyms have been widely used in Hebrew since at least the Middle Ages. Several important rabbis are referred to with acronyms of their names. For example, Rabbi Shlomo ben Yitzchak is known as Rashi, Rav Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) is commonly known as \"Rambam\" (Hebrew: ), Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman (Nahmanides) is likewise known as the \"Ramban\" (Hebrew: ), and Baal Shem Tov is called the \"Besht\" (Hebrew: ).\n\nA number of such acronyms differ only in their last letter. They all begin with \"Mahara-\", as an acronym of the words ... (\"Morenu Ha-Rav rabi ...\", Our teacher the Rabbi ...).\" \n\nThe usage of Hebrew acronyms extends to liturgical groupings: the word \"Tanakh\" (Hebrew: תנ״ך) is an acronym for Torah (Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Book of Prophets), and Ketuvim (Hagiographa).\n\nMost often, though, one will find use of acronyms as acrostics, in both prayer, poetry (see Piyyut), and kabbalistic works. Because each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value, embedding an acrostic may give an additional layer of meaning to these works.\n\nOne purpose of acrostics was as a mnemonic or a way for an author to weave his name as a signature, or some other spiritual thought, into his work, at a time when much was memorized. Examples of prayers which contain acrostics include:\n\n\nישי נוימן, גורמים פגרמטיים, סמנטיים וגרפופונמיים במילוּן קיצורי הכתב, החוג הישראלי לבלשנו ת 18, 2011\n"}

It is used to refer to one's self and is capitalized, although other pronouns, such as \"he\" or \"she\", are not capitalized.\n\nThe grammatical variants of \"I\" are \"me\", \"my\", \"mine\", and \"myself\".\n\nEnglish \"I\" originates from Old English (OE) \"ic\". Its predecessor \"ic\" had in turn originated from the continuation of Proto-Germanic *\"ik\", and \"ek\"; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, \"ek\" was attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant \"eka\"; see also ek erilaz). Linguists assume \"ik\" to have developed from the unstressed variant of \"ek\". Variants of \"ic\" were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.\n\nGermanic cognates are: Old Frisian \"ik\", Old Norse \"ek\" (Danish, Norwegian \"jeg\", Swedish \"jag\", Icelandic ég), Old High German \"ih\" (German \"ich\") and Gothic \"ik\" and in Dutch also \"ik\".\n\nThe Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the Proto Indo-European language (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *\"egō, egóm\", with cognates including\nSanskrit \"aham\", Hittite \"uk\", Latin \"ego\", Greek \"egō\", Old Slavonic \"azъ\" and Alviri-Vidari (an Iranian language) \"az\".\n\nThe oblique forms are formed from a stem \"*me-\" (English \"me\"), the plural from \"*wei-\" (English \"we\"), the oblique plurals from \"*ns-\" (English \"us\") and from Proto-Germanic \"*unseraz\", PIE \"*no-s-ero-\" (\"our, ours\").\n\n\"I\" (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English. This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase \"i\" was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.\n\nLike the other English personal pronouns \"we\" (\"us\"), \"he\" (\"him\"), \"she\" (\"her\"), and \"they\" (\"them\"), the pronoun \"I\" has several singular case forms.\nThese are: \n\nThere are some situations in which only the nominative form (\"I\") is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (\"me\") is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.\n\nIn all varieties of standard English, the nominative form \"I\" is used exclusively when it is the whole subject of an \"explicit\" verb, e.g. \nnot \nWith other pronouns, such as \"we\" (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.\n\nIn all varieties of standard English, the accusative form \"me\" is used exclusively when it is the whole direct or indirect object of a verb or preposition. The accusative \"me\" is also required in a number of constructions such as \"Silly me!\"\n\nIn many situations, both the nominative \"I\" and the accusative \"me\" are encountered.\n\nWhen the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative \"I\" is sometimes encountered in (very) formal style:\nBut this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:\n\"Me\" is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:\nThe nominative \"I\" is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:\nthough even here \"me\" is more common in non-formal style:\n\nFollowing \"as\" or \"than\" (without a following explicit verb), the accusative form is common:\nHowever, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and \"than\" or \"as\" as a conjunction, the nominative \"I\" is found in formal style:\n\nIn Australian English, British English and Irish English, many speakers have an unstressed form of \"my\" that is identical to \"me\" (see archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns).\n\nThe above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.\nIn some varieties English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as \"you and I\".

It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum. The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is James Hanken, the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.\n\nMany of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a fossil sand dollar which was found by Charles Darwin in 1834, Captain Cook's mamo, and two pheasants that once belonged to George Washington, now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.\n\nThe Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.\n\nThe Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist Louis Agassiz, and the museum used to be referred to as \"The Agassiz\" after its founder. Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and comparative relationships of animal life.\n\nThe Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory was created in 1894 when Radcliffe College rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.\n\nThe museum comprises twelve departments: Biological Oceanography, Entomology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammalogy, Marine invertebrates, Malacology, Ornithology, Population Genetics, and Vertebrate Paleontology. The Ernst Mayr Library and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum. The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the Biodiversity Heritage Library.\n\nThe museum publishes two journals: the \"Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College\", first published in 1869, and \"Breviora\", first published in 1956.\n\nIn contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of stuffed animals on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Notable exhibits include whale skeletons, the largest turtle shell ever found (eight feet long), \"the Harvard mastodon\", a long \"Kronosaurus\" skeleton, the skeleton of a dodo, and a coelacanth preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.\n\nNew and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include \"Evolution\" (2008); \"The Language of Color\" (2008 to 2013); \"Arthropods: Creatures that Rule\" (2006); \"New England Forests\" (2011); and \"Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm\" (2012).\n\n"}
{"id": "1091767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1091767", "title": "Non-well-founded set theory", "text": "Non-well-founded set theory\n\nNon-well-founded set theories are variants of axiomatic set theory that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of well-foundedness. In non-well-founded set theories, the foundation axiom of ZFC is replaced by axioms implying its negation.\n\nThe study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by Dmitry Mirimanoff in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an axiom. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until Peter Aczel’s hyperset theory in 1988.\n\nThe theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the logical modelling of non-terminating computational processes in computer science (process algebra and final semantics), linguistics and natural language semantics (situation theory), philosophy (work on the Liar Paradox), and in a different setting, non-standard analysis.\n\nIn 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced the concept of well-foundedness of a set:\n\nIn ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the axiom of regularity. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the \"foundation axiom\" since it can be proved within ZFC (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the axiom of regularity, the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set \"A\" such that \"A\" ∈ \"A\" is non-well-founded.\n\nAlthough Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation. In 1926, Paul Finsler introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of von Neumann 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades. An early non-well-founded set theory was Willard Van Orman Quine’s New Foundations, although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.\n\nSeveral proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by Paul Bernays (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by Ernst Specker who gave a different proof in his Habilitationsschrift of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 Rieger's theorem was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems. The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of Dana Scott (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called SAFA. Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was Maurice Boffa's axiom of superuniversality, described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade. Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every extensional set-like relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.\n\nA more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a bisimulation. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the axiom of extensionality. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as anti-foundation axioms, and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a hyperset.\n\nFour mutually independent anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:\nThey essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on accessible pointed graphs (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg. Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called Quine atom, formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.\n\nEach of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: V ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.\n\nAczel’s hypersets were extensively used by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy in their 1987 book \"The Liar\", on the liar's paradox; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.\n\nBoffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic nonstandard analysis.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "330432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330432", "title": "Note (typography)", "text": "Note (typography)\n\nA note is a string of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text. The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text, or both.\n\nFootnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work. Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.\n\nIn some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.\n\nIn English, a footnote is normally flagged by a superscripted number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.\n\nTypographical devices such as the asterisk (*) or dagger (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is *, †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶. Other symbols, including the #, Δ, ◊, ↓, and ☞, have also been used. In documents like timetables, many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.\n\nNotes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the Modern Language Association and the American Psychological Association) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.\n\nIn particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.\n\nThe MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.\n\nAside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:\n\nThe US Government Printing Office Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes. NASA has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.\nAssociate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation). Richard A. Posner has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions. Bryan A. Garner, however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.\n\nHTML, the predominant markup language for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the working group has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, MediaWiki, for example, has had to introduce its own codice_1 tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the \"Nelson\" HTML preprocessor.\n\nIt might be argued that the hyperlink partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.\n\nThe sign is historically equal to the asterisks used by Aristarchus of Samothrace at the Mouseion at Alexandria. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it \"marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage\" and was used together with other signs such as the obelus.\n\nThe London printer Richard Jugge is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the Bishops' Bible of 1568.\n\nEarly printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.\n\nAt times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.\n\n\n\n"}

They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. \n\nThe books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \"Glossies\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.\n\nThe first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.\n\nIn 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \"airplanes\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. \n\nThe first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like \"Aircraft\", \"Automobiles\" and \"Railway Locomotives\" proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. \n\nWhen Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\n\nAfter a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled \"Observer's Book of Observer's Books\" in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of \"Wayside and Woodland\" in 2003.\n"}
{"id": "177891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177891", "title": "Primary source", "text": "Primary source\n\nIn the study of history as an academic discipline, a primary source (also called an original source) is an artifact, document, diary, manuscript, autobiography, recording, or any other source of information that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in library science, and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.\n\nPrimary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary. A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used. For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.\n\nIn scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability. In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that \"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\" Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they \"speak for themselves\" in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources.\n\nIn scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. Though the terms \"primary source\" and \"secondary source\" originated in historiography as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.\n\nIn scientific literature, a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In political history, primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the history of ideas or intellectual history, the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In religious history, the primary sources are religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nA study of cultural history could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take archaeological artifacts and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.\n\n\nIn historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.\n\nThe Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:\n\"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.<br>\n\nAlthough many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in archives, libraries, museums, historical societies, and special collections. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the Huntington Library in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The Library of Congress maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are American Memory and Chronicling America. The National Archives and Records Administration also has digital collections in Digital Vaults. The Digital Public Library of America searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The Internet Archive also has primary source materials in many formats.\n\nIn the UK, the National Archives provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the National Archives of Scotland. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.\n\nIn other regions, Europeana has digitized materials from across Europe while the World Digital Library and Flickr Commons have items from all over the world. Trove has primary sources from Australia.\n\nMost primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or finding aid. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as WorldCat, the Library of Congress catalog, the National Archives catalog, and so on.\n\nHistory as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. Arthur Marwick says \"Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history.\" Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be memoirs, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in classical studies, where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.\n\nHistorians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of archives and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.\n\nHowever, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. \"Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret.\" Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.\n\nThe following questions are asked about primary sources:\n\nIn many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and \"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\" In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.\n\nHowever, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be bias and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.\n\nParticipants and eyewitnesses may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate. For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias. As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be censored or altered for propaganda or cover-up purposes. The facts can be distorted to present the opposing sides in a negative light. Barristers are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.\n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.\n\nIf a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\"\n\nIn some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the \"primary source\" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.\n\nHistorians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called diplomatics.\n\nFor centuries, Popes used the forged Donation of Constantine to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false Anglo-Saxon charters, a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by monasteries and abbeys to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by Sir Edward Dering, who placed false monumental brasses in a parish church. In 1986, Hugh Trevor-Roper \"authenticated\" the Hitler Diaries, which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the UK National Archives in the hope of establishing a false provenance. However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18134289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18134289", "title": "Qualitative comparative analysis", "text": "Qualitative comparative analysis\n\nIn statistics, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a data analysis technique for determining which logical conclusions a data set supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of logical inference to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by Charles Ragin in 1987.\n\nIn the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were dichotomous (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.\n\nIn QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the \"prime implicates\" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference \"(A and B) implies the particular value of D\".\n\nTo establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge. The method is used in social science and is based on the binary logic of Boolean algebra, and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.\n\nThe technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables. The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible. This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.\n\nAs this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with \"crisp-set\" QCA (csQCA), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values). Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA. \n\nStatistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to type I error. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated. Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error. Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference. Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the null hypothesis and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance.\n\nQCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y. However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher. For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the \"coverage\" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the \"consistency\" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.\n\nFuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.\n\nQCA has now become used in many more fields than political science which Ragin first developed the method for. Today the method has been used in:\n"}

In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.\n\n\nThese stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.\n\nThe purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's information need is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.\n\nLibrarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need. Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. \n\nMany of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.\n\nAs libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, co-browsing and instant messaging. \n\nUptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.\n\nLibrary users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. Unobtrusive user studies suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return. Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.\n\nFor a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents. Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of professionals who are able to provide help in this environment. If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of information overload, a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56067306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56067306", "title": "SDS-PAGE", "text": "SDS-PAGE\n\nSDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is a variant of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their molecular masses in an electric field. It uses sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate protein molecules.\n\nSDS-PAGE is a discontinuous electrophoretic system developed by Ulrich K. Laemmli which is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 KDa. The publication describing it is the most frequently cited paper by a single author, and the second most cited overall.\n\nSDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein, corresponding to one SDS molecule per two amino acids. SDS acts as a surfactant, covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.\n\nSDS tends to form spherical micelles in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules (monomer) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules. However, only SDS monomers bind to proteins via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the SDS micelles are anionic on the outside and do not adsorb any protein. SDS is amphipathic in nature, which allows it to unfold both polar and nonpolar sections of protein structure. In SDS concentrations above 0.1 millimolar, the unfolding of proteins begins, and above 1 mM, most proteins are denatured. Due to the strong denaturing effect of SDS and the subsequent dissociation of protein complexes, quaternary structures can generally not be determined with SDS. Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent cross-linking and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the chemical equilibrium of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against proteases and an increased biological half-life.\n\nAlternatively, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can also be performed with the cationic surfactants CTAB in a CTAB-PAGE, or 16-BAC in a BAC-PAGE.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or western blotting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.\n\nWhen using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the diffusion does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by radical polymerisation in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75 mm or 1.5 mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst TEMED and the radical initiator ammonium persulfate (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the meniscus and protects the gel solution of the radical scavenger oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with filter paper. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for protein sequencing, the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with cysteines in proteins.\n\nBy using a gradient mixer, gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses. Commercial gel systems (so-called \"pre-cast gels\") usually use the buffer substance Bis-tris methane with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel. These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer (continuous gel electrophoresis) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins. Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes. This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using MES or MOPS in the running buffer.\n\nDuring sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95 °C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein by disrupting hydrogen bonds and stretching the molecules. Optionally, disulfide bridges can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing thiols such as β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME, 5% by volume), dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 millimolar) or dithioerythritol (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.\n\nIn addition to the samples, a molecular-weight size marker is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel. The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.\n\nFor separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a voltage (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged anode. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.\n\nThe fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye bromophenol blue to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different pore size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), ionic strength and pH values (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing Tris-glycine-chloride buffer system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the zwitterionic form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-Tricine buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.\n\nAt the end of the electrophoretic separation, all proteins are sorted by size and can then be analyzed by other methods, e. g. protein staining such as Coomassie staining (most common and easy to use), silver staining (highest sensitivity), stains all staining, Amido black 10B staining, Fast green FCF staining, fluorescent stains such as epicocconone stain and SYPRO orange stain, and immunological detection such as the Western Blot. The fluorescent dyes have a comparatively higher linearity between protein quantity and color intensity of about three orders of magnitude above the detection limit, i. e. the amount of protein can be estimated by color intensity. When using the fluorescent protein dye trichloroethanol, a subsequent protein staining is omitted if it was added to the gel solution and the gel was irradiated with UV light after electrophoresis.\n\nProtein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. Glycoproteins have differential levels of glycosylations and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands. Membrane proteins, because of their transmembrane domain, are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower solubility in aqueous solutions, tend to bind lipids, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to hydrophobic effects when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in \"tailing\" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color (\"smear\") below a band. The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a gel extraction can be performed.\n\nAfter protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet cellophane film to which the gel and a one percent glycerol solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50 °C.\n\nFor a more accurate determination of the molecular weight, the relative migration distances of the individual protein bands are measured in the separating gel. The measurements are usually performed in triplicate for increased accuracy. The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility. Bands of proteins with glycosylations can be blurred. Proteins with many basic amino acids (e. g. histones) can lead to an overestimation of the molecular weight or even not migrate into the gel at all, because they move slower in the electrophoresis due to the positive charges or even to the opposite direction. Accordingly, many acidic amino acids can lead to accelerated migration of a protein and an underestimation of its molecular mass.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low scalability, it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.\n\nAdditionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the western blot for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a \"band shift\") or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).\n\nIn mass spectrometry of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using in-gel digestion. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical ultracentrifugation, but less exact than a mass spectrometry or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the DNA sequence.\n\nIn medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the HIV test and to evaluate proteinuria. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific antibodies of the patient, if they are present in his blood serum. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various serum proteins in the urine, e.g. Albumin, Alpha-2-macroglobulin and IgG.\n\nSDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis sequentially combines isoelectric focusing or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. Native PAGE is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, agarose gel electrophoresis can be used, e.g. the SDD-AGE. Some enzymes can be detected via their enzyme activity by zymography.\n\nWhile being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different chromatographic methods with subsequent photometric quantification, for example affinity chromatography (or even tandem affinity purification), size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography. Proteins can also be separated by size in a tangential flow filtration or a ultrafiltration. Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a pull-down assay. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of extractions and precipitations using kosmotropic molecules, for example the ammonium sulfate precipitation and the polyethyleneglycol precipitation.\n\nIn 1948, Arne Tiselius was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field. The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a zone electrophoresis improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect. The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by David F. Summers in the working group of James E. Darnell to separate poliovirus proteins. The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of bacteriophage T4.\n\n"}

In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) \"sigla\" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the copyist(s) of a work. See Critical apparatus.\n\nAbbreviated writing, using \"sigla\", arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials (stone, metal, parchment, etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, lapidaries, engravers, and copyists made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, several abbreviations, known as \"sigla\" (plural of \"siglum\" = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the Roman Empire. Additionally, in this period shorthand entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian Xenophon in the memoir of Socrates, and it was called \"notae socratae\". In the late Roman Republic, the Tironian notes were developed possibly by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, in 63 BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the Latin minuscule hand and square and rustic capital letters. The notation was akin to modern stenographic writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the Carolingians, who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a \"murky existence\" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (\"notae benenses\").\n\nTo learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. \"Sigla\" were mostly used in lapidary inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.\n\nThe abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the Carolingian Renaissance (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called \"notae communes\", were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called \"notae juris\", appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured \"ad hoc\" to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.\n\nScribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.\n\nIn epigraphy, common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:\n\nBoth forms of abbreviation are called \"suspensions\" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by \"contraction\" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, Nomina Sacra; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for \"Dis Manibus\" (\"Dedicated to the Manes\"); IHS from the first three letters of \"ΙΗΣΟΥΣ\"; and RIP for \"requiescat in pace\" (\"Rest in Peace\") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.\n\nAnother practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted \"Augustus\", thus, AVGG denoted \"Augusti duo\"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote \"Consulibus duobus\", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a \"vinculum\" (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the \"tilde\" (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.\n\nBesides the \"tilde\" and macron marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The \"typographic\" abbreviations should not be confused with the \"phrasal\" abbreviations: i.e. (\"id est\" — \"that is\"); loc. cit. (\"loco citato\" — \"in the passage already cited\"); viz. (\"vide licet\" — \"namely\", \"that is to say\", \"in other words\" — formed with \"vi\" and the \"yogh\"-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix -et and the conjunction et) and et cetera.\n\nMoreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including ligatures (e.g. Æ, Œ, etc.), the long s (ſ), and the half r, resembling an Arabic numeral two (\"2\"). The \"u\" and \"v\" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the \"i\" and \"j\" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using \"u\" and \"i\" for vowels and \"v\" and \"j\" for consonants is a late typographic development.\n\nSome ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin ampersand (&) replaces the conjunction \"and\" in English, \"et\" in Latin and French, and \"y\" in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the \"y\" is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign ⁊, resembling the digit seven (\"7\"), represents the conjunction \"et\" and is written only to the x-height; in current Irish language usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction \"agus\" (\"and\"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the percentage sign (%), from the Italian \"per cento\" (\"per hundred\"); the permille sign (‰), from the Italian \"per mille\" (\"per thousand\"); the pound sign (₤, £ and #, all descending from ℔ or lb, \"librum\") and the dollar sign ($), which possibly derives from the Spanish word \"Peso\". The commercial at symbol (@), originally denoting \"at the rate/price of\", is a ligature derived from the English preposition \"at\"; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of e-mail addresses.\n\nTypographically, the ampersand (\"&\"), representing the word \"et\", is a space-saving ligature of the letters \"e\" and \"t\", its component graphemes. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), when Ancient Greek language manuscripts introduced that tongue to Western Europe, its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-Latinist Protestant Reformation (1517–1648).\n\nThe common abbreviation \"Xmas,\" for Christmas, is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the Greek letter chi (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.\n\nAfter the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in Church Slavonic and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special diacritic symbol titlo, as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: \"Sacred names\") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in Greek ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to \"good\" beings and the same words, when referring to \"bad\" beings, are spelled out; for example, while \"God\" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as \"\", \"god\" referring to \"false\" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for \"angel\" is generally abbreviated as \"\", but the word for \"angels\" is spelled out for \"performed by evil angels\" in Psalm 77.\n\nAdriano Cappelli's \"Lexicon Abbreviaturarum\", enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often copying errors. For example, \"e.g.\" is written with periods, but modern terms, such as \"PC\", may be written in uppercase.\n\nIt should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to Western calligraphy or a beginner's guide.\n\nAdditionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two runes were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for \"fé\" \"cattle, goods\" and ᛘ for \"maðr\" \"man\".\n\nCappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:\n\nSuspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:\n\nThe largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.\n\nA dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.\nFor plural words, the siglum is often doubled: \"F.\" = \"frater\" and \"FF.\" = \"fratres\". Tripled sigla often stand for three: \"DDD\" = \"domini tres\".\n\nLetters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for \"con\" or \"contra\" (the latter sometimes with a macron above, \"Ↄ̄\").\n\nTo avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as \"ΧΡ\" (Greek letters chi+rho) = \"Christus\" or \"IHS\" = \"Jesus\".\n\nStarting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.\n\nAbbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:\n\nSuch marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (\"independent\" of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.\n\nThe meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.\n\nA superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter \"r\", before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter \"r\" before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is \"r-coloured\".\n\nHowever, \"a\", \"i\", and \"o\" above \"g\" meant \"gͣ\" \"gna\", \"gͥ\" \"gni\" and \"gͦ\" \"gno\" respectively. Although in English, the \"g\" is silent in \"gn\", but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above \"q\" meant \"qu\" + vowel: \"qͣ\", \"qͤ\", \"qͥ\", \"qͦ\", \"qͧ\".\n\n\nVowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were \"c\", e.g. \"nͨ\". A cut \"l\" above an \"n\", \"nᷝ\", meant \"nihil\" for instance.\n\nThese marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as \"letter-like glyphs\". Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are alchemical and zodiac symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.\n\nIn addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.\nMany more ligatures were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.\nSome such as r rotunda, long s and uncial or insular variants (Insular G), Claudian letters were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: thorn (þ=th) and eth (ð=dh).\nAn illuminated manuscript would feature miniatures, decorated initials or \"littera notabilior\", which later resulted in the bicamerality of the script (case distinction).\n\nVarious typefaces have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include \"record type\", which was first developed in the 1770s to publish Domesday Book and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.\n\nIn the Unicode Standard v. 5.1 (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts \"Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement\" (26 characters), \"Latin Extended Additional\" (10 characters), \"Supplemental Punctuation\" (15 characters), \"Ancient Symbols\" (12 characters) and especially \"Latin Extended-D\" (89 characters).\nThese consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in LaTeX or using overstrike in MS Word).\n\nCharacters are \"the smallest components of written language that have semantic value\" but glyphs are \"the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed\".\n\n\n\n"}

Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self-referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience. \n\nSelf-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the fourth wall to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.\n\nOld Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.\n\nRAS syndrome refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, \"RAS\" stands for Redundant Acronym Syndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields \"Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome\" and is self-referencing in a comical manner. It also reflects an excessive use of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms).\n\nMeta has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularised by Douglas Hofstadter who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, meta-jokes are a popular form of humor.\n\n"}
{"id": "738307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738307", "title": "Stephanus pagination", "text": "Stephanus pagination\n\nStephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the three volume 1578 edition of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva.\n\nIn the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e. This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato. For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage. For example, \"\"Symposium\" 172a\" cites \"Symposium\", Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which \"Symposium\" occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a. To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, \"page 50\" might refer to any of the \"pages 50\" across Stephanus' three volumes. Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.\n\nMore specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. \"Symposium\" 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in John Burnet's Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne's line divisions.\n\nThere are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\". The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. \n\nThe spurious dialogue \"Halcyon\" was included in the corpus of Lucian's works and does not have Stephanus numbers.\n\nBekker numbering is the comparable system for the works of Aristotle, and Diels–Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic research, unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.\n\nDepending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a bibliography, dictionary, or encyclopedia as either a tertiary or a secondary source. This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.\n\nIn some academic disciplines the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative. \n\nIn the United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model, a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.\n\nAs tertiary sources, encyclopedias, textbooks, and compendia attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).\n\nIndexes, bibliographies, concordances, and databases may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources.

{"id": "26681002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26681002", "title": "Text annotation", "text": "Text annotation\n\nText Annotation is the practice and the result of adding a note or gloss to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and editing, commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text. Text annotations are sometimes referred to as marginalia, though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.\n\nThis article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also Web annotation.\n\nText annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in Talmudic commentaries and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.\n\nWith the rise of the printing press and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text. Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or textual footnotes or endnotes rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.\n\nComputer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, learning, social reading, writing and editing, and other practices. Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and storage that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.\n\nText annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article \"From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation,\" scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)\"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks,\" which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)\"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers,\" which involves sharing of annotations; (3)\"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators,\" which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)\"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages,\" for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function. Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, motivation, and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support memory and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.\n\nEducational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and communication. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports comprehension and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.\n\nOther areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for collaborative learning, both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products. In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of critical reading and stance-taking necessary for effective argumentative writing.\n\nWhile shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, \"since the 1920s, literacy theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy.\" Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.\n\nMore recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at Carnegie Mellon University. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.\n\nSimilarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, critical thinking, and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.\n\nA meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them English, sport psychology, and hypermedia. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, metacognition, and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.\n\nText annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text. In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called \"queries\"). Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks. Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.\n\nMuch research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of computer-supported cooperative work.\n\nResearch in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.\n\nThe structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a \"body\", an \"anchor\", and a \"marker\". The body of an annotation includes reader-generated symbols and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.\n\nIT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:\nAnnotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions. Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as \"anchored discussion\".\n\nIT-based annotation systems include standalone and client-server systems. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of libraries, patent offices, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce taxonomies of annotation forms. Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in Palo Alto and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995 at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).\n\nAnnotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer and Microsoft Word. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as Adobe Acrobat, which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.\n\nTim Berners-Lee had already implemented the concept of directly editing web documents in 1990 in WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability. An early version of NCSA Mosaic in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability, though it was quickly removed. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, WebDAV, was then reintroduced as an extension.\n\nA different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document. This approach was pioneered by Stet, the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the GNU General Public License. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The co-ment system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using Django/Python on the server side and various AJAX libraries such as JQuery on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nSince 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project has offered the free, open web annotation service Hypothes.is. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a LMS or CMS. Both webpages and PDFs can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, HyLighter supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on NLP tasks as Named-entity recognition, relationship extraction or normalization. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via supervised learning.\n\nSpecialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public Library of Science, has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.\n\n\n"}

The main purpose of such reference works for users \"to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.\n\nAlthough including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a dictionary, a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.\n\nIn library science and information science, thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models. Recently, thesauri have been implemented with Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).\n\nThe word \"thesaurus\" is derived from 16th-century New Latin, in turn from Latin \"thēsaurus\", which is the Latinisation of the Greek (\"thēsauros\"), \"treasure, treasury, storehouse\". The word \"thēsauros\" is of uncertain etymology. Douglas Harper derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι \"tithenai\", \"to put, to place.\" Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek suffix .\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term \"thesaurus\" was applied to any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" (1532), and the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\" (1572). The meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and \"thesaurer\" is attested in Middle English for \"treasurer\".\n\nIn antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.\n\nThe first modern thesaurus was \"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world. Entries in \"Roget's Thesaurus\" are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nThesauri have been used to perform automatic word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.\n\n"}

These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as \"etc.\" and \"Mrs.\" are not three-letter acronyms, but \"TLA\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation).\n\nMost three-letter abbreviations are \"initialisms\": all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in \"APA\" . Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in \"CAT scan\".\n\n\nThe exact phrase \"three-letter acronym\" appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA. The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982. In 1988, in a paper titled \"On the cruelty of really teaching computer science\", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote \n\"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA ...\" By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.\n\nThe number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or permutations) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576.

The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the acronym instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, \"www\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"dubdubdub\" in speech.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Margate and at Merchant Taylors' School, where he was entered in 1824.\n\nHe was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the Royal Exchange during 1838–9.

In 1863 Chaffers published two important works:\n\nOther publications are \"The Keramic Gallery\", in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from \"Marks and Monograms\" (1874); \"Gilda Aurifabrorum\", a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues.\n\nHis reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at Manchester in 1857, South Kensington in 1862, Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to \"Archæologia\", to \"Notes and Queries\", and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge.\n\nIn 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett. About 1870 he retired from Fitzroy Square to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to West Hampstead, where he died on 12 April 1892.\n\nAttribution\n"}
{"id": "411562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411562", "title": "Xmas", "text": "Xmas\n\nXmas is a common abbreviation of the word \"Christmas\". It is sometimes pronounced , but \"Xmas\", and variants such as \"Xtemass\", originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation . The \"X\" comes from the Greek letter \"Chi\", which is the first letter of the Greek word \"Χριστός\", which in English is \"Christ\".\nThe \"-mas\" part is from the Latin-derived Old English word for \"Mass\".\n\nThere is a common misconception that the word \"Xmas\" stems from a secular attempt to remove the religious tradition from Christmas by taking the \"Christ\" out of \"Christmas\", but its use dates back to the 16th century.\n\n\"Xmas\" is deprecated by some modern style guides, including those at the \"New York Times\", \"The Times\", \"The Guardian\", and the BBC. Millicent Fenwick, in the 1948 \"Vogue's Book of Etiquette\", states that \"'Xmas' should never be used\" in greeting cards. \"The Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage\" states that the spelling should be considered informal and restricted to contexts where concision is valued, such as headlines and greeting cards. \"The Christian Writer's Manual of Style\", while acknowledging the ancient and respectful use of \"Xmas\" in the past, states that the spelling should never be used in formal writing.\n\nEarly use of \"Xmas\" includes Bernard Ward's \"History of St. Edmund's college, Old Hall\" (originally published circa 1755). An earlier version, \"X'temmas\", dates to 1551. Around 1100 the term was written as \"Xp̄es mæsse\" in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". \"Xmas\" is found in a letter from George Woodward in 1753. Lord Byron used the term in 1811, as did Samuel Coleridge (1801) and Lewis Carroll (1864). In the United States, the fifth American edition of William Perry's \"Royal Standard English Dictionary\", published in Boston in 1800, included in its list of \"Explanations of Common Abbreviations, or Contraction of Words\" the entry: \"Xmas. Christmas.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. used the term in a letter dated 1923. Since at least the late 19th century, \"Xmas\" has been in use in various other English-language nations. Quotations with the word can be found in texts first written in Canada, and the word has been used in Australia, and in the Caribbean. \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\" stated that modern use of the term is largely limited to advertisements, headlines and banners, where its conciseness is valued. The association with commerce \"has done nothing for its reputation\", according to the dictionary.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the former Church of England Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, recommended to his clergy that they avoid the spelling.\nIn the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the \"Christ\" in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he called a \"pagan\" spelling of Christmas.\n\nThe abbreviation of Christmas as \"Xmas\" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. \n\nThe December 1957 \"News and Views\" published by the Church League of America, a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett, attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled \"X=The Unknown Quantity\". The claims were picked up later by Gerald L. K. Smith, who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a \"blasphemous omission of the name of Christ\" and that \"'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity.\" Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of \"world Jewry\", had \"outlawed the name of Christ\". There is, however, a well documented history of use of \"Χ\" (actually a chi) as an abbreviation for \"Christ\" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross. The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.\n\nDennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states \"there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity\". Among them are evangelist Franklin Graham and CNN journalist Roland S. Martin. Graham stated in an interview: \"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ.\" Roland Martin likewise relates the use of \"Xmas\" to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days. Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of \"Christ\" for various purposes.\n\nThe word \"Christ\" and its compounds, including \"Christmas\", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern \"Xmas\" was commonly used. \"Christ\" was often written as \"Xρ\" or \"Xt\"; there are references in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the uppercase forms of the Greek letters χ (Ch) and ρ (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for \"Christ\"). The labarum, an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧, is a symbol often used to represent Christ in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian Churches.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") and the \"OED Supplement\" have cited usages of \"X-\" or \"Xp-\" for \"Christ-\" as early as 1485. The terms \"Xtian\" and less commonly \"Xpian\" have also been used for \"Christian\". The \"OED\" further cites usage of \"Xtianity\" for \"Christianity\" from 1634. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\", most of the evidence for these words comes from \"educated Englishmen who knew their Greek\".\n\nIn ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name. In many manuscripts of the \"New Testament\" and icons, Χ is an abbreviation for Χριστος, as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate sigma); compare IC for Jesus in Greek.\n\nOther proper names containing the name \"Christ\" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as \"X\" or \"Xt\", both of which have been used historically, e.g., \"Xtopher\" or \"Xopher\" for \"Christopher\", or \"Xtina\" or \"Xina\" for the name \"Christina\".\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, \"Xene\" and \"Exene\" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer Christina Aguilera has sometimes gone by the name \"Xtina\". Similarly, Exene Cervenka has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.\n\nThis usage of \"X\" to spell the syllable \"kris\" (rather than the sounds \"ks\") has extended to \"xtal\" for \"crystal\", and on florists' signs to \"xant\" for \"chrysanthemum\", even though these words are not etymologically related to \"Christ\": \"crystal\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"ice\" (and not even using the letter χ), and \"chrysanthemum\" comes from Greek words meaning \"golden flower\", while \"Christ\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"anointed\".\n\nIn the animated television series \"Futurama\", which is set in the 31st century, Xmas is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode \"Xmas Story\", is said to have become an \"archaic pronunciation\").\n\nIn the American version of the board game \"Monopoly\", players can draw a card from the Community Chest which reads: \"Xmas fund matures. Collect $100\".\n\n\n"}
