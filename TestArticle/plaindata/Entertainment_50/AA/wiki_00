{"id": "511640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511640", "title": "5.1 surround sound", "text": "5.1 surround sound\n\n5.1 surround sound (\"five-point one\") is the common name for six channel surround sound audio systems. 5.1 is the most commonly used layout in home cinema. It uses five full bandwidth channels and one low-frequency effects channel (the \"point one\"). Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II, DTS, SDDS, and THX are all common 5.1 systems. 5.1 is also the standard surround sound audio component of digital broadcast and music.\n\nAll 5.1 systems use the same speaker channels and configuration, having a front left and right, a center channel, two surround channels and the low-frequency effects channel designed for a subwoofer.\n\nA prototype for five-channel surround sound, then dubbed \"quintaphonic sound\", was used in the 1975 film \"Tommy\".\n\n5.1 dates back to 1976 when Dolby Labs modified the track usage of the six analogue magnetic soundtracks on Todd-AO 70 mm film prints. The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 (released on the film, \"Logan's Run\") did not use split surrounds, and thus was not 5.1. Dolby's first use of split surrounds was with 70mm film, which received wide release in 1979 with \"Apocalypse Now\". Instead of the five screen channels and one surround channel of the Todd-AO format, Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track provided three screen channels, two high-passed surround channels and a low-frequency surround channel monophonically blended with the two surround channels.\n\nWhen digital sound was applied to 35 mm release prints, starting with \"Batman Returns\" in 1992, the 5.1 layout was adopted. The ability to provide 5.1 sound had been one of the key reasons for using 70 mm for prestige screenings. The provision of 5.1 digital sound on 35 mm significantly reduced the use of the very expensive 70 mm format. Digital sound and the 5.1 format were introduced in 1990, by KODAK and Optical Radiation Corporation, with releases of \"Days of Thunder\" and \"The Doors\" using the CDS (Cinema Digital Sound) format.\n\n5.1 digital surround, in the forms of Dolby Digital AC3 and DTS, started appearing on several mid 90s Laserdisc releases, with among the earliest being \"Clear and Present Danger\" and \"Jurassic Park\" (the latter having both AC3 and DTS versions). Many DVD releases have Dolby Digital tracks up to 5.1 channels, due to the implementation of Dolby Digital in the development of the DVD format. In addition, some DVDs have DTS tracks with most being 5.1 channel mixes (a few releases, however, have 6.1 “matrixed” tracks). Blu-ray and digital cinema both have eight-channel capability which can be used to provide either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. 7.1 is an extension of 5.1 that uses four surround zones: two at the sides and two at the back.\n\nA system of digital 5.1 surround sound has also been used in 1987 at the Parisian cabaret the Moulin Rouge, created by French engineer Dominique Bertrand. To achieve such a system in 1985 a dedicated mixing console had to be designed in cooperation with Solid State Logic, based on their 5000 series, and dedicated speakers in cooperation with APG. The console included ABCDEF channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C centre, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already developed a similar 3.1 system in 1973, for use at the official International Summit of Francophone States in Dakar.\n\nThe order of channels in a 5.1 file is different across file formats. The order in WAV files is (not complete) Front Left, Front Right, Center, Low-frequency effects, Surround Left, Surround Right.\n\nRegarding music, the main goal of 5.1 surround sound is a proper localization and equability of all acoustic sources for a centered positioned audience. Therefore, ideally five matched speakers should be used.\n\nFor play-back of 5.1 music recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have been released and propose the following configuration (ITU-R BS 775):\n\n"}

It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.\n\nThere are a few examples of tragic plays with middle-class protagonists from 17th century England (see domestic tragedy), but only in the 18th century did the general attitude change. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play: George Lillo's \"The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell\", which was first performed in 1731. In France, the first \"tragédie bourgeoise\" was \"Sylvie\" by Paul Landois, which came out in 1741. Years later came two plays by Denis Diderot: \"Le fils naturel\" was first staged in 1757 and \"Le père de famille\" in the following year; while these plays were not strictly tragedies, they treat bourgeois lives in a serious manner atypical of contemporary comedy and provided models for more genuinely tragic works.\n\nWhile ordinary people had always been the subject of comedies, classical and neo-classical theorists asserted that tragic heroes should always be men of noble rank. Aristotle articulates this idea in \"ars poetica\" (\"The Poetics\") and it figures prominently in later ancient writings on drama and poetics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century critics, including the influential German Martin Opitz, perpetuated the theory that only members of the higher classes were capable of suffering harm serious enough to deserve dramatic reenactment. This rule was followed throughout Europe for centuries: usually, princes and members of the nobility, such as Andreas Gryphius' Carolus Stuardus (i.e. King Charles I of England), Jean Racine's Phèdre (the wife of Theseus, a mythical king of Athens) or William Shakespeare's King Lear, serve as tragic protagonists.\n\nIn Germany, where the new genre was called \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\", it was especially successful. Usually, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play \"Miss Sara Sampson\", which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest \"Bürgerliches Trauerspiel\" in Germany. However, Christian Leberecht Martini's drama \"Rhynsolt und Sapphira\" is slightly older. Lessing's \"Emilia Galotti\" of 1771 is a classic example of the German Bürgerliches Trauerspiel. Lessing also offered a thorough theoretic justification for his disregard of the old rules in his \"Hamburgische Dramaturgie\". Other important examples of German Bürgerliche Trauerspiele are \"Die Soldaten\" by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1776) and Friedrich Schiller's \"Kabale und Liebe\" (1784). \n\nBourgeois tragedies tend to propagate the values of the bourgeois class to which their heroes belong. Their ideal is the virtuous citizen, who is excluded from state affairs and whose intentions are focused on his private life and the life of his family. Values like virtue, humanity, individuality and true feelings are cherished in bourgeois tragedies.\n"}

As a discipline, choreomusicology emerged at the end of the twentieth century as a field of study concerned with the relationship between music and dance. More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed. Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: John Cage and Merce Cunningham, Igor Stravinsky and George Balanchine, and Louis Horst and Martha Graham. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran Tari Piring, West Javanese Pencak Silat, and Afro-Brazilian Capoeira to name but a few examples.\n\nThe following institutions have developed programs practicing and/or researching choreomusicology: accompagnement choregraphique CNSMDP (Paris), continuing studies at Institut del Teatre (Barcelona), MAD at DNSPA (Copenhagen).

{"id": "30740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30740", "title": "Classical unities", "text": "Classical unities\n\nThe classical unities, Aristotelian unities, or three unities are rules for drama derived from a passage in Aristotle's \"Poetics\". In their neoclassical form they are as follows:\n\n\nAristotle dealt with the unity of action in some detail, under the general subject of \"definition of tragedy\", where he wrote: \"serious, complete in itself and of a certain magnitude\". \n\nNow, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude … As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.\n\nHis only reference to the time in the fictive world is in a distinction between the epic and tragic forms:\n\nEpic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type. They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form. They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.\n\nUnlike his prescriptive attitude regarding the plot (unity of action), Aristotle here merely remarks on the typical duration of a tragedy's action, and does not suggest any kind of imperative that it always ought to be so. He was writing after the golden age of Greek drama, and many Greek playwrights wrote plays that do not fit within these conventions.\n\nAristotle does not actually mention the neoclassical unity of place at all. However, the prevalent interpretation of his \"Poetics\" during the Middle Ages inclined toward interpreting his comment on time as another \"unity\".\n\nItalian critics of the 16th century, from Lodovico Castelvetro onwards, and then 17th-century French critics, proponents of the neoclassical movement, both expanded Aristotle's descriptions. The result was to make them into prescriptions for structuring plays. French drama of the 17th century, particularly that of Molière and Racine, was highly regular, and Corneille incurred harsh criticism for departing from the unities in \"Le Cid\". The English dramatists writing for the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage were largely unaware of these structures.\n\nBy the later 17th century, however, English dramatists (under the influence of French criticism picked up by those in exile during the English Interregnum) did begin to assess their own plays according to these rules. Thus, John Dryden, among many others, compares the \"irregular\" Shakespeare (only two of Shakespeare's plays conform to the unities – \"The Comedy of Errors\" and \"The Tempest\") with the \"regular\" Dryden in his \"Essay of Dramatick Poesie\" (1668), and makes use of the unity of time in this passage criticizing Shakespeare's history plays.\n\n... if you consider the Historical Playes of Shakespeare, they are rather so many Chronicles of Kings, or the business many times of thirty or forty years, crampt into a representation of two hours and a half, which is not to imitate or paint Nature, but rather to draw her in miniature, to take her in little; to look upon her through the wrong end of a Perspective, and receive her Images not onely much less, but infinitely more imperfect then the life: this instead of making a Play delightful, renders it ridiculous.\n\nHowever, Dryden declared Shakespeare \"incomparable\" because of his disregard for convention:\n\n... in most of the irregular Playes of Shakespeare or Fletcher (for Ben Johnson's are for the most part regular) there is a more masculine fancy and greater spirit in all the writing, then[sic] there is in any of the French.\n\nAlexander Pope criticizes the violation of the unities in his \"Dunciad\". In the 1728 version of the poem, the goddess Dulness notes that \"Time himself stands still at her command,/ Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land\" (\"Dunciad\" 1728, i, 69–70). Additionally, he notes a violation of unity of action, as tragedy and comedy were mixed.\n\nSamuel Johnson, too, applied the unities to drama in his \"Prefaces to Shakespeare\". He was well aware that Aristotle had only recommended the unity of action, and knew that rules must serve drama, not vice versa:\n\nWhether Shakespeare knew the unities, and rejected them by design, or deviated from them by happy ignorance, it is, I think, impossible to decide, and useless to inquire. We may reasonably suppose, that, when he rose to notice, he did not want the counsels and admonitions of scholars and critics, and that he at last deliberately persisted in a practice, which he might have begun by chance. As nothing is essential to the fable, but unity of action, and as the unities of time and place arise evidently from false assumptions, and, by circumscribing the extent of the drama, lessen its variety, I cannot think it much to be lamented, that they were not known by him, or not observed: Nor, if such another poet could arise, should I very vehemently reproach him, that his first act passed at Venice, and his next in Cyprus. Such violations of rules merely positive, become the comprehensive genius of Shakespeare…\n\nJohn Pitcher, in his Arden Shakespeare Third Series edition of \"The Winter's Tale\" (2010), argues that Shakespeare was familiar with the unities due to an English translation of \"Poetics\" that became popular around 1608, and that The Winter's Tale is intentionally breaking all the rules.\n\nThe classical unities were influential in dramatic criticism until Victor Hugo's \"Hernani\" (1830); one of the things that made that play controversial at its debut was its violation of these rules of classicism. In the Spanish theatrical tradition, there is Lope de Vega's \"Arte nuevo de hacer comedias\" of 1609, which is a defense of the new form for writing and representation of Golden Age Spanish theatre. Lope's \"Arte nuevo\" is a 389 verse poem which explicitly defends his and other dramaturges, distancing from Aristotelian unities of theatre.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5928", "title": "Clown", "text": "Clown\n\nA clown is a comic performer who employs slapstick or similar types of physical comedy, often in a mime style.\n\nClowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. \n\nModern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or \"Varieté\" shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.\n\nMany circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as \"Joey\", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.\n\nThe comedy that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition.\n\nThe \"fear of clowns,\" circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term coulrophobia.\n\nThe \"\"clown\" character developed out of the zanni \"rustic fool\" characters of the early modern commedia dell'arte, which were themselves directly based on the \"rustic fool\"\" characters of ancient Greek and Roman theatre.\nRustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as \" sklêro-paiktês\" (from \"paizein\" \"to play (like a child)\") or \"deikeliktas\", besides other generic terms for \"rustic\" or \"peasant\". In Roman theater, a term for clown was \"fossor\", literally \"digger; labourer\".\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was first recorded c. 1560 (as \"clowne, cloyne\") in the generic meaning \"rustic, boor, peasant\". \nThe origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with \"clumsy\".\nIt is in this sense that \"Clown\" is used as the name of fool characters in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and \"The Winter's Tale\".\nThe sense of \"clown\" as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on Elizabethan \"rustic fool\" characters such as Shakespeare's.\n\nThe harlequinade developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that \"Clown\" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for Harlequin's slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.\n\nThe now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by Joseph Grimaldi, who played Clown in Charles Dibdin's 1800 pantomime \"Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World\" at Sadler's Wells Theatre, where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.\n\nThe circus clown developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from Philip Astley's London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian George L. Fox became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.\nTom Belling senior (1843–1900) developed the \"red clown\" or \"Auguste\" (\"Dummer August\") character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated \"white clown\". Belling worked for Circus Renz in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or \"hobo\" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in Ruggero Leoncavallo's 1892 opera \"Pagliacci\" (\"Clowns\").\nBelling's \"Auguste\" character was further popularized by Nicolai Poliakoff's \"Coco\" in the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nThe English word \"clown\" was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French \"clown\", Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian \"klovn\", Romanian \"clovn\" etc.\n\nItalian retains \"Pagliaccio\", a Commedia dell'arte zanni character, and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French \"Paillasse\", Spanish \"payaso\", Catalan/Galician \"pallasso\", Portuguese \"palhaço\", Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish \"palyaço\", German \"Pajass\" (via French), Yiddish פּאַיאַץ (\"payats\"), Russian пая́ц.\n\nIn the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the tramp or hobo. Examples include Marceline Orbes, who performed at the Hippodrome Theater(1905), Charlie Chaplin's \"The Tramp\" (1914), and Emmett Kelly's \"Weary Willie\" based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by Otto Griebling during the 1930s to 1950s. Red Skelton's Dodo the Clown in \"The Clown\" (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, \"a funny man with a drinking problem\".\n\nIn the United States, Bozo the Clown was an influential \"Auguste\" character since the late 1950s. \"The Bozo Show\" premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. McDonald's derived its mascot clown, Ronald McDonald, from the \"Bozo\" character in the 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played \"Bozo\" during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.\n\nBased on the \"Bozo\" template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (\"Bozo\"-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to \"Clown Care\" or \"hospital clowning\" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. Clowns of America International (established 1984) and World Clown Association (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.\n\nThe shift of the \"Auguste\" or \"red clown\" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a \"Bozo\"-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the evil clown character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.\n\nThere are different types of clowns portrayed around the world. They include\n\nThe classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition\nhas a precedent in the pairing of Pierrot and Harlequin in the Commedia dell'arte.\nOriginally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.\n\nIn the 18th-century English Harlequinade, Harlequin was now paired with Clown.\nAs developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nThe \"white clown\", or \"clown blanc\" from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste. They are also distinguished as the \"sad clown\" (blanc) and \"happy clown\" (auguste).\n\nThe Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.\n\nThe auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.\n\nThe \"contra-auguste\" plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.\n\nThere are two major types of clowns with \"whiteface\" makeup:\nThe classic \"white clown\" is derived from the Pierrot character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque \"Auguste\" types. Francesco Caroli and Glenn \"Frosty\" Little are examples of this type. The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the \"Bozo\" type, known as \"Comedy\" or \"Grotesque Whiteface\". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. \nIn the comedic partnership of Abbott and Costello, Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.\n\nTraditionally, the whiteface clown uses \"clown white\" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible. In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.\n\nWhiteface makeup was originally designed by Joseph Grimaldi in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.\n\nAmerica's first great whiteface clown was stage star George \"G.L.\" Fox. Following English Joseph Grimaldi, Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.\n\nThe character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or hobo. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps Otto Griebling and Emmett Kelly. Red Skelton, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Sacha Baron Cohen would all fit the definition of a character clown.\n\nThe character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.\n\nThe most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the \"hobo\", \"tramp\" or \"bum\" clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is attitude. According to American circus expert Hovey Burgess, they are :\n\nClowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.\n\nThe World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.\n\nClowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims \"to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns\".\n\nIn the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as tightrope, juggling, unicycling, Master of Ceremonies, or ride an animal. Clowns may also \"sit in\" with the orchestra. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.\n\nFrameworks are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act. Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.\n\nShows are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.\n\n\n\n\"Clown Stops\" or \"interludes\" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few \"gags\" or several \"bits\". Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called \"reprises\" or \"run-ins\" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of \"business\" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the \"artiste\" by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.\n\nAmong the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the \"too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car\" stunt; doing just about anything with a rubber chicken, tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or \"clown bikes\". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.\n\nIn anthropology, the term \"clown\" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such \"clowns\" have an important position are termed \"clown societies\", and a \"clown\" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a \"ritual clown\".\n\nThe most ancient \"clowns\" have been found in the Fifth dynasty of Egypt, around 2400 BC. Unlike court jesters, clowns have traditionally served a socio-religious and psychological role, and traditionally the roles of priest and clown have been held by the same persons.\nPeter Berger writes that \"It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society\". For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a physical performance discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.\n\nIn Native American mythology, the Trickster channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character. A Heyoka is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles. The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse. The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a Winkte.\n\nMany native tribes have a history of clowning.\nThe Canadian Clowning method developed by Richard Pochinko and furthered by his former apprentice, Sue Morrison, combines European and Native American clowning techniques.\n\nIn this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the medicine wheel. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

These teams often perfect their proficiency and then choose to compete against other programs. These competitions are generally called \"drill meets\", and are held all across the world. The top American bladed (bayonet-only) independent drill meet was Pro America and the top American independent armed drill meet is the Isis World Drill Championships for post high school professional exhibition drillers in the nation. Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) programs may also compete in the National High School Drill Team Championships held in Daytona Beach, Florida. There are two divisions for competing, Unarmed, and Armed. During the summers, most drill teams go to drill camps to hone their skills. Also see high school \"military\" drill teams in high school. Washington, Idaho, California.\n\nAll of the United States military service branches have an official drill team part of their respective service honor guard. The service academies have drill teams, as well as many college and university ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) and high school JROTC (Junior ROTC) units. Additionally, many community-based organizations such as the Army Cadet Corps, Naval Sea Cadets, Young Marines, and Civil Air Patrol maintain military drill teams. Formerly, some of these units were called Crack Squads.\n\nThe Canadians have the Canadian Cadet Organization. The organization consists of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, Royal Canadian Army Cadets, and Royal Canadian Air Cadets. All three branches of the organization have drill competitions throughout the year. Some of these competitions are hosted by the Regional Cadet Support Units.\n\nCanadian drill competitions consist of the following:\n\nThe Norwegian military consist of only one single company sized drill team, consisting of a band and a drill platoon. The team is one of five infantry companies that are assigned the mission to protect His Majesty the King of Norway and the royal family, as well as guarding the Royal Palace. The 3rd company, HMKG are also used to represent the Norwegian armed forces at state-related matters such as state-visits, ceremonies, national festivities, and were also prominent in the Winter World Cup 2010 as guards. As of 2012, His Majesty the King's Guard is also responsible for the safety and defence of the city of Oslo, in case of a national crisis. A total of six companies make up His Majesty The King's Guard (Hans Majestet Kongens Garde), and is a part of the Norwegian army.\n\nThe band is hand picked through interviews and playing tests prior to the draft date. The band consists of signal horns, a drumline, a pit and the main band. Most of the members year goes to practising and basic military training as the year is a part of their military service. The band is probably the only troop that almost never have \"green\" duty (as in field duty). Also, the band never stand guard at the castle nor the other guarding posts around Oslo, neither does the drill platoon.\n\nThe drill platoon consists of 32–40, first-year servicing soldiers. These are all hand picked through a rigorous selection process that lasts from their drafting at the start of October till December. The soldiers go through basic military training as well as having to learn how to march, weapons drill, and how to perform synchronically. Throughout the selection process, the soldiers have to prove themselves worthy a spot on the drill team, as these soldiers will be representing not only the King's guard, but also the Norwegian military and the Norwegian state both national and internationally. Everything in their daily duty from the bed, room, facilities, closets, uniforms, and physique needs to be at excellent standards 24/7. These men strive for perfection in all that they do and are often seen running around the various woods nearby the base as well as working out at the gym. Every year, these soldiers finish their service with one of the highest average physical results in the army. Their uniforms are spotless and wrinkleless, in addition their boots are so well polished that you can literally reflect yourself in them. As opposed to what one might think, these soldiers draft year have been compared to as even harder than what the first-year service in the special forces is. Though most likely not as hard physically, the mentality and the pressure in being the best of the best puts these soldiers under a tremendous amount of pressure every hour of every day, every day of the year. Their rigorous training results in being one of the best drill teams in the world.\n\nThe band and drill platoon (3rd company) is the only drill team that have been invited to the legendary Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo nine times, 2012 being the most recent.\n\nA drill meet is a competition for military-style drill teams. The US military's honor guard units have drill teams; however, they do not compete against each other in a drill meet such as this. The only exception to this is Pro America where individuals compete, but not the full drill teams. US high school JROTC and college ROTC teams often compete against each other.\n\nEach meet has different phases:\n\nMany drill meets differ regarding what events are offered and what divisions of competition are presented. Drill meets generally include both an armed and unarmed divisions. Events offered generally include several different phases: inspection, color guard regulation drill, and, in addition, (drill based on a service's drill manual) an exhibition drill in which they march intricate maneuvers along with manipulating equipment including rifles, sometimes with fixed bayonets.\n\n\nEach of the above phases can be marched by an armed (with a military sword, saber, or rifle) or unarmed team. NOTE: Many drill meets allow the use of a sword in the unarmed division, but never a rifle of any kind. All drill teams can march a guidon.\n\nThe current system used almost all military drill competitions includes multiple military judges each looking at the unit as a whole while they are competing at differing angles. These judges then grade every aspect of the performance on their own score sheets. This grading is based strictly on the military drill manuals in use for the meet (i.e., Army TC 3-21.5, Marine Corps Order P-5060.20, Air Force Manual 36-2203, etc.) Using this evaluating technique closely parallels what most of these individuals have done throughout their military careers at various levels throughout their training (most of these evaluators come from military training facilities and/or base honor guards). Judges score teams within ranges from POOR, to AVERAGE, to EXCEPTIONAL. Most meets using this system have a \"Judge's Notes\" section where judges are either encouraged or required (depending on the meet) to write some candid notes for the team to utilize to interpret the numerical scores delivered on the score sheets.\n\nDance drill teams evolved from early pep squads and military-style drum and bugle corps that performed in the stands and/or during halftimes at football games.\n\nGussie Nell Davis, from Farmersville, Texas, created a pep squad at Greenville High School in Greenville, Texas in 1929. The team was called the \"Flaming Flashes\", and they performed at every football game halftime. During Miss Davis’ ten years at Greenville, the team evolved from just simple marching, stunts, and holding up letters, to twirling batons, performing basic dance steps, and eventually, with some help from the band director at Port Arthur High School in southeast Texas, becoming a precision drum and bugle corps.\n\nKay Teer Crawford, a high school cheerleader in the Rio Grande Valley during the early 1930s, had an idea of forming a team from the girls who were not selected for cheerleader. After graduating from college, Kay returned to Edinburg High School to teach physical education and to direct the Sergeanettes in 1936. They marched on the field with a “military swing” style, and eventually evolved into an acclaimed precision dance group. Crawford is equally noted with Gussie Nell Davis as having started the \"drill team\" concept, but it was Crawford who later started the national dance competition industry.\n\nIn 1939, the president of Kilgore College, Dean B.E. Masters, contacted Gussie Nell Davis about coming to Kilgore, Texas, to start a group that would “be interesting and keep the folks in their seats at half-time.” They also needed to recruit women to the school since the enrollment was primarily made up of men who were seeking to learn more about the oil business. Dr. Masters was not quite sure what he wanted, but he knew he did not want a traditional drum and bugle corps. He wanted something new, something that did not yet exist, and left the decisions up to Miss Davis.\n\nMiss Davis created the “Rangerettes\" to perform at Kilgore College football game halftimes. The Rangerettes almost immediately became the gold standard for all teams, both high school and college, and almost all Texas drill teams now consist of a line of performers with the officers in front of the team leading them in at every game.\n\nIn Tyler, Texas, just 30 miles from Kilgore, the second college drill team to be created in Texas was the Tyler Junior College Apache Belles in 1947. A fierce but friendly rivalry between the Apache Belles and the Rangerettes developed quickly, and continues to this day.\n\nMuch like Miss Davis, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, was recruited by Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University) in 1960 to create the “Strutters”, the first drill team at a four-year college.\n\nThere are over a thousand high school drill teams in the state of Texas today with over 30,000 students participating every year. The traditional uniform for these teams usually consists of a white hat with white boots. The officers of the teams also typically wear an all white uniform, while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies.\n\nTraditionally, Texas high school drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.\n\nThe first dance-drill teams in California were school affiliated. Teams in California now typically identify as either a pep squad, drill team, dance team, dance-drill team, or dance company. But these affiliations began to widen greatly as parks & recreation programs, independent performing arts programs, and dance studios opened across the state in the late 1980s and developed their own dance-related programs. More traditional drill teams march in parades with school marching bands during the fall/winter, perform field shows (halftime shows) at athletic events, and compete at indoor dance/drill competitions during the late-winter and/or spring seasons.\n\nAfter moving from Texas to California following her collegiate studies, drill team founder Dr. Kay Teer Crawford eventually started the world's first national precision dance-drill team competition in 1967: Miss Dance Drill Team USA (aka U.S. Nationals & Pageant, MDDTUSA). In 1981, Crawford also created the world's first international dance competition: Miss Dance Drill Team International. The U.S. National dance competition and world championships are now held annually in Southern California.\n\nBut there are now numerous drill team & dance team competition circuits in California (i.e. Miss Dance Drill Team USA, Varsity/USA/UDA, CADTD, etc.). And while most current school-affiliated teams do not compete on the festival level, those that do are consistently adjudicated in the following areas as developed by Dr. Kay Teer Crawford (Different competition circuits place different point/percentage weight on the importance of each of the following three areas in determining a final score):\n\n\nThere are also quite a variety of categories in which a team can compete. Examples are as follows:\n\n\nUnlike other states where schools are placed in separate divisions based on their school attendance size (as associated with state-organized athletic organizations), no such affiliation currently exists in California because dance is not considered an athletic sport. As a result, competition divisions are sub-divided into size of the performance group in a given routine, with teams allowed to compete in as many sizes as they wish:\n\n\nAll teams are adjudicated on a point system, with total points deciding ordinal rankings in determining winners.\n\nIn Washington state, the phrase \"drill team\" usually refers to high school performance/spirit teams that compete in the \"drill\" and/or \"military\" category at local, regional and statewide \"dance/drill\" competitions. Drill routines (sometimes referred to as \"drills\") typically entail (indeed some argue \"should\" entail):\n\n\nJudging is currently known as ordinal judging and ratings categorized by superior, exceptional, excellent, and good.\n\nThe WIAA Dance/Drill competition is the annual championship event for qualified dance and drill teams held annually in the last weekend of March.\n\nA Washington drill team member, or \"driller\", is not a dancer, but a dancer can be a driller. Since the foci of drill are presentation and spatial precision, drillers do not necessarily need attributes typically ascribed to dancers, such as a high level of flexibility (although this is a large portion of what many teams exhibit in their routines and part of their score) or an aptitude for expressing emotions with the body. This generally allows for larger team sizes, with most teams having about 20 or more members.\n\nIn Utah, most 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A schools have a drill team. This sport is incredibly competitive in this state, probably due to the high number of dancers. Tryouts are normally held the school year before the performing season during the months of April and May, giving teams the entire summer to work on their technique. During this time, drill teams often attend a dance camp to learn small dances to perform at school events such as sports games and assemblies. Along with these shorter routines, teams also learn longer and more technical competition routines to compete at a few invitational competitions and later a regional competition. The teams that place at the top at region (usually the top 4) go to state to compete against other teams in other regions. \n\nPerformed dance styles include military, kick, character, lyrical, hip hop, pom, jazz, and officer, among others.\n\nEvery year at region and state competitions, teams compete in military and dance, and every other year, compete in kick or character.\n\n\n\n"}

His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.\n\nFarian started as a trained cook before moving into the music industry. In April 1967, he released \"Will You Ever Be Mine\" under the name \"Frankie Farian\".\n\nIn the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\" (a remake of Prince Buster's song \"Al Capone\" from 1967), released under the pseudonym Boney M., became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with \"Was kann schöner sein\", a German version of \"When You've Gotta Go\" originally by Solomon King, co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker. \nShying away from the spotlight, he hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, Marcia Barrett and Liz Mitchell, who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, Bobby Farrell, was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.\n\nFarian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips, and Robin McAuley, many of Toto fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\", becoming a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985.\n\nIn 1986, Farian produced and mixed the Meat Loaf album \"Blind Before I Stop\". He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album \"Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries\", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring John Parr.\n\nIn 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the Milli Vanilli scandal, a musical equivalent of ghostwriting. As a producer, he had assembled a group from session musicians, fronting it with visually attractive dancers Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the records. After these details emerged, Milli Vanilli had their 1990 Grammy Award for Best New Artist withdrawn, and at least 27 different lawsuits were filed in the United States under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws. Following the Milli Vanilli controversy, Farian went on to develop similar Eurodance groups La Bouche and Le Click.\n\nSome other groups that Farian has been involved with are Eruption (he became a manager in 1977) and No Mercy.\n\nOn 15 August 2006, the musical \"Daddy Cool\" opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End. The line-up included Michelle Collins, Michael Harvey, Javine Hylton, and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, Germany and the show also toured in the Netherlands from August 2011 to February 2012, Spain (Palma de Mallorca) in July 2012, Switzerland from, November 2015 to January 2016 Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.\n\nAlso in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled \"Doin' Fine\", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, Peter Wilson, Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string arrangement from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, \"Daddy Cool\". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson. It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled \"Daddy's Cool 12\" Mix\", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007. The original version of \"Doin' Fine\" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, \"Follow Me\", which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by Amanda Lear.\n\nOther acts he collaborated with include Gilla, Eruption, La Mama, Precious Wilson, Gift and Daniel Lopes.\n\nFarian resides in Miami, Florida.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48648089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48648089", "title": "Game development kit", "text": "Game development kit\n\nGame development kits (GDK) are specialized hardware used to create commercial videogames. They may be partnered with game development tools, special game engine licenses, and other middleware to aid video game development. GDKs are typically not available to the public, and require game developers to enter an agreement, partnership, or program with the hardware manufacturer to gain access to the hardware. As game console generations pass, development kits often get sold through websites like eBay without repercussions. This is often because the console manufacturers discontinue certain development programs as time passes.\n\nIn the 1980s, computing did not involve 3D modelling or any complex programming due to the limitations of hardware. This, combined with the hobbyist nature of early computer game programming, meant that not many individuals or smaller companies would develop for consoles. Even when consoles became mainstream (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System), there was no official or publicly available GDK since most console manufacturers would develop their games in-house. For example, Nintendo had internal development teams for both hardware and software.\n\nBy the fifth generation of consoles, game development kits were developed to encourage more developers to make console games and grow the videogame industry. Game development kits began as a simple way for developers to connect their computers to console hardware, allowing them to compile software on their PC and see it play directly on a console. Once most GDKs started becoming bundled with hardware-specific software, hobbyists or anyone not directly affiliated with a console manufacturer would have to write their games without the specialized software to access unique features such as the Xbox One's Kinect or the Wii U GamePad.\n\nModern game development kits often come bundled with the specialized software, and are much more formalized compared to previous-generation GDKs. In older generations of console gaming, developers had to make their own hardware and write games at various levels of programming (such as assembly). Today, programs such as Unity 3D provide a complete software environment and console manufacturers such as Nintendo provide polished & powerful development hardware through their developer programs. Other console manufacturers even allow the retail consoles to be used as development kits, provided that the development software is being used by the developer.\n\nFor a significant portion of the NES lifespan, there was no official development kit. Video game developers creating games for the NES would have to make their own development kits, such as Rocket Science Production with their \"NES Mission Control\" development system. At least two programs were used in conjunction with the NES Mission Control hardware; NESTEST.EXE which would be used to test and debug the development hardware, and HST.EXE which would be used for communication between a computer and the NES development hardware.\n\nThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System used specialized EPROM cartridges for development, as well as various software. Similar to the NES, developers often made their own development software or relied on middleware made by other developers.\n\nThe are several variations of the PlayStation development kit used for game creation. One variation of the development kit had only three components, while the PlayStation Ultimate Development Kit included up to 26 components, including the complete Net Yaroze development kit.\n\nThe Net Yaroze version of the development kit was unique in that it had some features removed and added compared to the official (complete) PlayStation development kit. The Net Yaroze hardware was designed for hobbyists, while official developers would have access to the official PlayStation development kits. There was also a blue version of the PlayStation made for developers that would read burned discs to allow quick testing of imaged builds of their videogames. While there were official PlayStation-branded CD-Rs that could be used with the blue PlayStation, regular CD-Rs were also compatible with the system.\n\nThe Nintendo 64 development kit consisted of multiple components, both for the N64 and its add-on, the N64DD. The main hardware used in N64 game development was the Partner-N64 Development Kit, and used tall cartridges for game development/testing rather than the short cartridges that were sold with retail games. Another hardware component in N64 development was the NU64 Flash Gang Writer, which allowed developers to copy data from one cartridge to multiple cartridges simultaneously. This device was primarily used to create press and test copies of games, and also relied on tall cartridges instead of short retail cartridges.\n\nOther versions of the Nintendo 64 GDK are the SN Systems development suite, as well as the SN Maestro 64 Music development system. The development suite allowed developers to run code from a computer directly to the console, and included a software package. The Maestro 64 Music system allowed developers to load music software on to the console, and play music through the Nintendo 64's hardware.\n\nSega Dreamcast units were unique in that they used \"GD-ROM\" discs; giga discs that held 1GB of data. This was slightly more than a typical CD, but less than a DVD. While GD-ROM burners were used by some developers, since the Dreamcast was compatible with CDs and since most games didn't take up 1GB of data at the time, GD-ROMs remained uncommon as developers opted to use the more-easily accessible CDs for their disc media.\n\nWhen developers were creating software for the original Xbox, a prototype of the controller was used in the early development kits. This controller was slimmer, had elongated sides, and used a USB cable instead of an Xbox port-compatible cable.\n\nMicrosoft manages the Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program, which licenses development kits (hardware and software) to professional software developers working on tools and technologies for games. Access to this program requires good industry references, prior experience in games tools and middleware development, and signing a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program.\n\nThe Wii development kit was a bundle of the \"NDEV\" hardware - a big black box full of debugging/testing hardware that looks nothing like the slim white Wii consoles sold to consumers - and a disc containing the developer software tools.\n\nMicrosoft maintains multiple developer programs for people wanting to develop games for their platforms; ID@Xbox for Xbox One game development, and the Windows Dev Center for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Xbox One game and application development. \n\nThe PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program. The PlayStation 4 development kits were known as \"Orbis\", though this was just a codename. Academic institutions can register to receive PS4 development kits for educational use, and are not region-restricted unlike regular PlayStation Developer Program members.\n\nNintendo maintains a unified developer program for both its Wii U and Nintendo 3DS families of platforms. This developer program provides software and middleware to developers, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. Games and applications published through this program are considered \"third-party\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.\n\nThe Wii U development hardware consists of a system called \"CAT-DEV\", with its accompanying peripherals such as the Display Remote Controller (presumably the Wii U GamePad) and sensor bar.\n\nNintendo's developer program allows developers to use Nintendo 3DS development kits, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. As mentioned in the Nintendo Wii U section above, games and applications published through this program are considered \"third-party\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms.\n\nStrangely, some 3DS development kits cannot play retail games.\n\n"}

One interest is the layout and organization of communication systems at scales from cities to the planet. Closely related to this are the varying levels of access to communication systems from place to place. Attention to how places differ in regard to communication access leads to an interest in the changes that occur in places when new media diffuse into those places. A complementary interest is in how places are represented in various media—for example pictures of idyllic beaches in tourism advertisements or written descriptions of war zones in newspaper stories. Communications also allow people to interact with distant places, so a final area of investigation is how, by interacting with others through various kinds of communication systems, people inhabit various kinds of \"virtual\" spaces.\n\nOf particular interest to media/communication theorists are questions regarding the social and cultural formations associated with media, which in turn point to how media are involved in the transformation of belonging and citizenship, which relate to geographical territories. Social and cultural formations also depend on distinctions between public and private life, which have traditionally depended on spatial boundaries between public and private places. Topics of particular interest to geographers are place representations in visual media including photography, film and graffiti, in auditory media including radio and music recordings, and even in embodied communications such as dance and video games.\n\nGeographical interest in the systematic study of communication can be traced to the writings of Richard Hartshorne in the 1930s. Hartshorne considered language to be a key element forming culture regions, meaning that the dominant language is similar within a particular culture region and it changes when one leaves a culture region. A very different aspect of communication became the focus during the 1950s and 1960s as geographers began to measure and model the interactions between locations. In this case, geographers involved in the quantitative revolution explained the accelerating flow of information between locations in terms of \"time-space convergence\" and \"human extensibility.\" It was not until the 1970s that geographers began to focus on communications in terms of content, considering questions of symbolism, representation, metaphor, iconography and discourse. This interest first took form in geographical research that drew on humanism, phenomenology and hermeneutics. By the 1990s, this approach shifted towards a more critical sensibility unpacking the various meanings of landscape. Geographers researching communication over the past two decades have extended these research areas while carrying forward early insights regarding the importance of communication to the formation of regions, the rate of information flow as a measure of spatial interaction, and the association between landscape and representation. New approaches to communication have been advanced under the frameworks of non-representational theory, actor-network theory, and assemblage theory. Equally important is the effort to think through digital code and its relationship with space.\n\nAccording to one taxonomy, the geography of media and communication involves four complementary aspects: places-in-media, media-in-places, media-in-spaces and spaces-in-media. Places-in-media are representations of place circulating in all sorts of media for all sorts of reasons, for example landscape paintings signifying the owner's status, and news images of urban spaces linking crime and chaos to minority populations and the poor. Media-in-places are ways in which particular places such as the home, classroom, workplace, or city street are altered functionally and experientially by transformations in how people use media in those places. Media-in-spaces are communication infrastructures, whether historical, like telegraph cables, or contemporary like optical fiber cable when mapped and analyzed in terms of their physical layout. Spaces-in-media are the topologies that symbols, images, information and ideas move through as they spread or diffuse from person to person and from group to group.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2320803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320803", "title": "Heroic drama", "text": "Heroic drama\n\nHeroic drama is a type of play popular during the Restoration era in England, distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter. The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; John Dryden's \"The Indian Emperour\" (1665) and Roger Boyle's \"The Black Prince\" (1667) were key developments.\n\nThe term \"heroic drama\" was invented by Dryden for his play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1670). For the \"Preface\" to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of \"epic poetry\" for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays. Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.\n\nFirst, the play should be composed in heroic verse (closed couplets in iambic pentameter). Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters. Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like Achilles, dominating even when wrong. \"The Conquest of Granada\" followed all of these rules. The story was that of the national foundation of Spain (and King Charles II was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.\n\nDryden's \"Conquest of Granada\" is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called \"All for Love\", 1678) of Shakespeare's \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (\"The Rival Queens\") and Thomas Otway, whose \"Venice Preserved\" is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's \"The Rehearsal\" and Henry Fielding's \"The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great\"\n\n\"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits.\" Restoration plays by Sir William Davenant, Thomas Otway, Nathaniel Lee, John Crowne, Elkanah Settle, and John Banks, and later works by Nicholas Rowe and Joseph Addison, have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.\n\nToday, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from Classical critics. There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from France (particularly those of Corneille and Boileau) did not match English theatrical history or practice. The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from Thomas Rymer, who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage. Aristotle had only spoken of satire, epic, and tragedy, and Horace also wrote only of comedy, tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature. He was attempting his own neo-classicism. The First Folio of Shakespeare had divided Shakespeare's plays into \"history,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"comedy,\" but these terms were stretched. Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. \n\nGeorge Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others satirized heroic drama in \"The Rehearsal\". The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward. Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.\n\nBuckingham's criticism of Dryden in \"The Rehearsal\" is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's \"personal\" interest in creating a \"pure\" drama. The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.\n"}
{"id": "2187161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187161", "title": "Intellectual rights to magic methods", "text": "Intellectual rights to magic methods\n\nIntellectual rights to magic methods refers to the legal and ethical debate about the extent to which proprietary or exclusive rights may subsist in the methods or processes by which magic tricks or illusions are performed. It is a subject of some controversy. \n\nOn one side, many magicians argue that methods represent \"intellectual property\" and that publication or sharing of methods should be subject to strict codes developed by magicians' organizations. On the other side, a range of people argue that publication of information about methods should not be subject to restrictions because knowledge should be freely available. The sharing of magic methods with non-magicians or the open publication of methods is referred to in the magic community as \"exposure\" and many magicians react angrily to it. \n\nWhile many magic tricks rely on traditional methods, there is also a continuing development and progress within the genre. Those who are performers and amateurs tend to take a very defensive stance against all \"exposure\", while those who are creators and originators tend to care more about recent works – works with living and identifiable creators.\n\nThere are a number of areas of law that might provide a basis for magicians to claim ownership of certain pieces of knowledge and to prevent exposure. Copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark law, are the primary sources of legal protection at issue on the topic. Each type of protection has its own limitations and loopholes. \n\nUnder the Berne Convention, member states are free to prescribe in their national legislation that copyright is automatically granted to a work only when it is \"fixed\", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium. In the U.S., copyright law only protects works that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Accordingly, some argue, the processes or movements required for a trick are not copyrightable within the U.S, but recordings, written descriptions, or photographs of such a performance may be copyrightable themselves.\n\nThe idea–expression dichotomy specifies that mere ideas are not entitled to copyright; only the expression of those ideas are granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.\n\nAnother potential area of copyright protection for magic creators is through a choreography or pantomime copyright. This was successfully employed by Teller in 2014 in a case against Belgian entertainer Gerard Dogge, who had posted a YouTube video of an illusion called The Rose & Her Shadow.\n\nMagic illusion inventor and magician Hessel Bos also registered a magic trick as a copyright with the United States Copyright Office (registration is not essential for copyright protection but it offers additional advantages for rights holders). Bos registered his tricks by describing every movement of the magic tricks via text and photographs and then submitted these documents to the copyright office. They were approved under the Performance Art section and a certificate of registration was granted. In September 2008 Bos successfully filed a complaint under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act against America Online to remove a video from their website.\n\nAn invention or process which facilitates the performance of a magic trick is potentially patentable in the U.S. However, applying for patent protection requires the public release of information about how the device or process works. Furthermore, when a patent is obtained, it can only be used to prevent a third party from making or using the subject matter of the patent. This prevents other magicians from performing the trick but cannot be used to prevent anyone from revealing how the trick works.\n\nNotably, in 1938, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was sued by magician Horace Goldin over an ad campaign which revealed one method for a \"Sawing a woman in half\" trick. The case was eventually dismissed by a federal court and Goldin then gave up on patenting his methods.\n\nExamples of patented inventions for conjuring include:\n\nMagic methods are effectively forms of trade secret and share many characteristics of trade secrets in other business sectors. As such there is a significant body of law that falls under the headings of \"confidentiality\" and \"contract law\" that might be used to control or protect them. These measures can effectively allow a perpetual monopoly in secret information – i.e. it does not expire as would a patent or copyright.\n\nA company or individual can protect their confidential information through non-disclosure contracts with employees or business associates. A magician might therefore ask a partner or fellow magician to sign a non-disclosure agreement before sharing magic methods. That contract could then be enforced through the courts. The terms of such contracts might be subject to constraints of employment law (for example including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic and time scope). As with law generally, there will be variations across jurisdictions. \n\nInformation which a magician has intentionally kept confidential and which is not in the public domain may also be deemed to have a legally enforceable quality of confidentiality. The exact legal definitions of circumstances in which such protection applies vary across jurisdictions, as do the remedies available.\n\nCourt cases provide the ultimate test for any of the possible rights outlined above and, indeed, often establish law in the form of case law. There have been a number of court cases in which magicians have sought to assert rights to magic methods and prevent publications or broadcasts. These include:\n\n\nThe most effective protection against the public exposure of magic methods may be a matter of ethics or peer pressure. One of the largest societies of magicians in the world, the International Brotherhood of Magicians, has a Code of Ethics which states:\n\nThe Brotherhood advises that any individual who is a professional or amateur magician should be aware that \"exposing\" the methods of an illusion may result in damage to their relations among other magicians.\n\nHowever, such codes don't extend to selling magic, though magicians consider the seller of a magic trick should prove that the purchaser intends to learn and perform the trick for others, thereby becoming a magician, rather than simply wanting to know how a magic trick is done out of curiosity.\n\n"}
{"id": "1832507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832507", "title": "Kobzar", "text": "Kobzar\n\nA Kobzar (, pl. kobzari ) was an itinerant Ukrainian bard who sang to his own accompaniment played on a multistringed bandura or kobza.\n\nKobzars were often blind and became predominantly so by the 1800s. \"Kobzar\" literally means 'kobza player', a Ukrainian stringed instrument of the lute family, and more broadly — a performer of the musical material associated with the kobzar tradition.\n\nThe professional kobzar tradition was established during the Hetmanate Era around the sixteenth century in Ukraine. Kobzars accompanied their singing with a musical instrument known as the kobza, bandura, or lira. Their repertoire primarily consisted of para-liturgical psalms and \"kanty\", and also included a unique epic form known as dumas. \n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century there were three regional kobzar schools: Chernihiv, Poltava, and Slobozhan, which were differentiated by repertoire and playing style.\n\nIn Ukraine, kobzars organized themselves into regional guilds or brotherhoods, known as tsekhs. They developed a system of rigorous apprenticeships (usually three years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations in order to become a kobzar. \n\nThese guilds were thought to have been modelled on the Orthodox Church brotherhoods as each guild was associated with a specific church. These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononenko, p. 568–9). The Orthodox Church however was often suspicious of and occasionally even hostile to kobzars.\n\nThe institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the Ukrainian SSR in the mid 1930s during Stalin's radical transformation of rural society which included the liquidation of the kobzars of Ukraine. Kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the bandura.\n\nSoviet kobzars were stylised performers on the bandura created to replace the traditional authentic kobzari who had been wiped out in the 1930s. These performers were often blind and although some actually had contact with the authentic kobzari of the previous generation, many received formal training in the Folk conservatories by trained musicians and played on contemporary chromatic concert factory made instruments. \n\nTheir repertoire was primarily made up of censored versions of traditional kobzar repertoire and focused on stylized works that praised the Soviet system and Soviet heroes. \n\nIn recent times, there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the Kobzar Guild as a centre for the dissemination of historical authentic performance practice.\n\n\"Kobzar\" is also a seminal book of poetry by Taras Shevchenko, the great national poet of Ukraine.\n\nThe term \"kobzar\" has on occasion been used for hurdy-gurdy players in Belarus (where the hurdy-gurdy is often referred to as a \"kobza\", and bagpipe players in Poland where the bagpipe is referred to as a \"kobza\" or \"koza\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53974", "title": "Legend", "text": "Legend\n\nLegend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human actions perceived or believed both by teller and listeners to have taken place within human history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \"possibility,\" but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh, vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm defined legend as folktale historically grounded. A modern folklorist's professional definition of \"legend\" was proposed by Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:\nLegend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly ecotypified historicized narrative performed in a conversational mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition it belongs.\n\n\"Legend\" is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage circa 1340. The Old French noun \"legende\" derives from the Medieval Latin \"legenda\". In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word \"legendary\" was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends. This word changed to \"legendry\", and \"legendary\" became the adjectival form.\n\nBy 1613, English-speaking Protestants began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in John Foxe's \"Actes and Monuments\") was fictitious. Thus, \"legend\" gained its modern connotations of \"undocumented\" and \"spurious\", which distinguish it from the meaning of \"chronicle\".\n\nIn 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as \"poetic, legend historic.\" Early scholars such as Friedrich Ranke and Will Erich Peuckert followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s, by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the Aarne–Thompson folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.\n\nIn an early attempt at defining some basic questions operative in examining folk tales, in 1925 characterised the folk legend as \"a popular narrative with an objectively untrue imaginary content\" a dismissive position that was subsequently largely abandoned.\n\nCompared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928. The narrative content of legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of folktale; Wilhelm Heiske remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.\n\nIn \"Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft\" (1928), Ernst Bernheim asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour. Gordon Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise; thus \"Urban legends\" are a feature of rumour. When Willian Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly were \"short-term legends\" and the persistent ones be termed \"long-term legends\", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.\n\nIn the narrow Christian sense, \"legenda\" (\"things to be read [on a certain day, in church]\") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, \"legend\", in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains supernatural, divine or fantastic elements.\n\nHippolyte Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: \"The \"legend\", on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\"\n\nFrom the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with \"Gothic\" overtones, which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.\n\nStories that exceed the boundaries of \"realism\" are called \"fables\". For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.\n\nLegend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. Jacob de Voragine's \"Legenda Aurea\" or \"The Golden Legend\" comprises a series of \"vitae\" or instructive biographical narratives, tied to the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of hagiography. The \"Legenda\" was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the saint of the day.\n\nThe vanishing hitchhiker is the best-known urban legend in America, traceable as far back as 1870, but it is found around the world including in Korea and Russia. In the legend, a young girl in a white dress picked up alongside of the road by a passerby. The unknown girl in white remains silent for the duration of her ride, thanks the driver, and quietly gets out at her destination. When the driver turns to look back, the girl has vanished. In 1942, Beardsley and Hankey collected 79 written accounts of the legend.\n\n"}

Field\") is a tongue-in-cheek conspiracy theory in Hong Kong over the existence of a force field that repels tropical cyclones from the city.\n\nThe \"Li\" in Li's Field refers to local business tycoon Li Ka-shing, the implied developer of the field. The basis of Li's Field rests on the way Hong Kong's government is organized. The city's Commerce and Economic Development Bureau oversees the Hong Kong Observatory, and that has led to speculations the Observatory bases its issuance of tropical cyclone warning signals on economic reasoning, instead of scientific reasoning.\n\nIn Hong Kong, schools above kindergarten level are shut down when Tropical Cyclone Signal Number 8 is issued (kindergarten classes are suspended when Signal Number 3 is issued), and all non-essential staff at a workplace are sent home. Some believe businesses have pressured the Observatory into avoiding the issuance of Typhoon Signal Number 8, in an effort to avoid economic losses.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2006, and again in 2010, the Observatory did not issue a single tropical cyclone warning above Number 3.\n\nIn 2006, Typhoon Prapiroon brought 200km/h wind to Hong Kong, overturned containers, uprooted trees, and caused many flight delays at the airport, but the Observatory did not issue Signal Number 8, remaining at the lower level Signal Number 3.\n\nObservatory Chief Lam Chiu-ying later said the decision was based on the fact that wind speeds in Kai Tak, near the Victoria Harbour, did not reach the level required for issuing Signal Number 8. Nevertheless, humorous speculation arose that Li Ka-shing was behind the decision, in an effort to maximize productivity from his workers and prop up the economy.\n\nMedia reports in 2010, citing research by the Observatory, revealed the reason behind the fewer occurrences of Signal Number 8. It is believed that an ocean temperature difference between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean is to blame.\n\nFormer Observatory Chief Lee Boon Ying told reporters in 2010 the Observatory has always put the safety of Hong Kong residents as its first priority, and is not swayed by business or economic concerns.\n\nIn an impromptu survey conducted by Observatory Chief Shun Chi Ming at a student forum in 2014, about 20% of approximately 100 students in attendance say they believe Li's Field exists.\n\nLi's force field has been mentioned in local cultural media, and has been the subject of many Internet memes.\n\n\n"}

The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for merchandising purposes.\n\nA media franchise often consists of cross-marketing across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and can create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers (fandom). Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success. American Idol was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner Kelly Clarkson signing with RCA Records and having the release of \"A Moment Like This\" becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100. The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an \"American Idol\" book that made the bestseller list and the film \"From Justin to Kelly\". A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term \"media franchise.\" The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular \"Twilight\" book series that was adapted into the five films of \"The Twilight Saga\". Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including metaseries, which can be used to describe works such as Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series.\n\nMultimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through licensing agreements, with respect to intellectual property in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, \"[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products.\" The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:\n\nLong-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include Andy Hardy, Ma and Pa Kettle, Bulldog Drummond, Superman, Tarzan, and Batman. The longest-running modern film franchises include James Bond, Godzilla, \"Friday the 13th\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", and \"Star Trek\". In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.\n\nMedia franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as Nancy Drew, Miss Marple, and other popular detectives, as well as popular comic book superheroes. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in novels, particularly those in the fantasy and science fiction genres, such as \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Star Trek\", \"Doctor Who\" and \"Star Wars\". Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into animated television series, video games, or both.\n\nA media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like Square Enix's \"Final Fantasy\" or the \"National Lampoon\" series, and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.\n\nNon-fiction literary franchises include the \"...For Dummies\" and \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to...\" reference books. An enduring and extensive example of a media franchise is Playboy Enterprises, which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, \"Playboy\", within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (\"Playboy's Penthouse\", in 1959), and even its own television channel. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, a radio show, direct to video films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.\n\n\n"}

It was issued in Australia by April, where over the Northern summer (Southern winter) it rose to number 1.\n\nFinally issued in North America in August 1982, \"Mickey\" became a number 1 hit in the US and Canada in late 1982, a year and a half after its original release.\n\nThe original Racey song did not include the famous \"Oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine, you blow my mind\" chant, which Basil added.\n\nFor years, it had been rumored that the name was changed to Mickey because Basil had a crush on Monkees' drummer and lead vocalist Micky Dolenz after meeting him on the set of their movie \"Head\" for which she was the choreographer; however, this claim has been denied by Basil, who said she didn't know Dolenz that well.\n\nTwo different music videos for the song were recorded, one featuring Basil with a backing band, and another featuring costuming and choreography inspired by cheerleader dance routines. Filmed in 1981, the Cheerleader video is considered the very first choreographed dance video, and the opening stunt, where a cheerleader jumps through the center of a human pyramid, is now illegal in competition.\n\nRock critic Robert Christgau commented on the obscene content of the lyric \"So come on and give it to me / Any way you can / Any way you want to do it / I'll take it like a man\". Christgau wrote in a review at the time that Basil \"was the only woman ever to offer to take it up the ass on Top 40 radio.\" \n\nThe single scored number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for one week and number two in the UK Singles Chart. The song was Basil's only Top 40 success. It was named #5 on VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of All Time, #16 on \"20 to 1\"'s Top 20 One Hit Wonders Countdown and #57 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\". It has also appeared on multiple \"greatest\" or \"best\" lists and countdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK singer Lolly scored a top five hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1999. In addition, there is also a karaoke version of the cover on the album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dr. Cockroach determines that the only way to defeat the carrots and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of the carrots (specifically because B.O.B. has no brain and thus is immune to the carrots' mind control powers), which B.O.B eventually, albeit reluctantly, does.

{"id": "70174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70174", "title": "Moral", "text": "Moral\n\nA moral (from Latin \"morālis\") is a message that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a story or event. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.\n\nAs an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of Aesop's fable of the Tortoise and the Hare, in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is \"slow and steady wins the race\". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.\n\nThe use of stock characters is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in Shakespeare's plays, the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the Prologue to \"Romeo and Juliet\").\n\nThroughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In classical drama, for example, the role of the chorus was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the novels of Charles Dickens are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of Victorian Britain.\n\nMorals have typically been more obvious in children's literature, sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: \"The moral of the story is …\". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for ironic purposes.\n\nSome examples are: \"Better to be safe than sorry\" (precautionary principle), \"The evil deserves no aid\", \"Be friends with whom you don't like\", \"Don't judge people by the way they look\", \"Slow and steady wins the race\", \"Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny\", and \"Your overconfidence is your weakness\". Aesop's Fables are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.\n\nMorals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in children's literature. Part of the reason for this was the writings of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, Thomas Day (1748–1789) wrote \"Sandford and Merton\", elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. Maria Edgeworth (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is \"The Purple Jar\". During this time, the theme of \"a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers\" (p. 93).\n\nThe ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.\n\n"}

{"id": "3365514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3365514", "title": "Oral interpretation", "text": "Oral interpretation\n\nOral Interpretation is a dramatic art, also commonly called \"interpretive reading\" and \"dramatic reading\", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive. In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.\n\nThe term is succinctly defined by Paul Campbell (\"The Speaking and Speakers of Literature\"; Dickinson, 1967) as the \"oralization of literature\"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (\"Oral Interpretation\"; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as \"the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety\". Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is \"reading from a manuscript\". This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.\n\nVoice and movement technique is \"opsis\" (\"spectacle\") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, \"melopoiia\" (\"music technique\").\n\nBecause oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are \"interpreters\" – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on. When, for example, the writer David Sedaris reads one of his stories on stage, or when Leonard Cohen performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation. But Sedaris is no actor, and even Cohen himself would say that \"he\" is no singer.\n\nIn the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms. This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called \"English and Speech\", \"Speech and Dramatic Arts\" or \"Communication and Theatre Arts\". The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.\n\nIn high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota. Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:\n"}

Pay cards are chip cards, punch cards, or a piece of paper card with several fields which servers mark with special pens, pencils, or clippers. \n\nWhen patrons leaves the nightclub, they remit their pay card to a cashier, who decodes it, and the required payment is displayed on the checkout box. The pay card is most often the property of the nightclub and stays in the cashbox for future use. Patrons losing or damaging the paycard have to pay a maximum price indicated on the paycard.\n\nNightclubs use paycards because it facilitates payment; staff do not have to carry change, and servers do not have to walk about the restaurant with hundreds of dollars in cash. Some nightclub owners use paycard systems because they believe that patrons drink more than in clubs that do not use paycards.\n\nThere are some disadvantages for nightclubs that use paycards. There are often long queues at the exit, especially when the club closes and is crowded. Paycards can be damaged by foam parties. Some unsophisticated paycards can be manipulated by the patron. \n\nPaycards give patrons an incentive to escape through emergency exits, so these, in such clubs, are safeguarded by alarms. \n"}
{"id": "140614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140614", "title": "Postman Pat", "text": "Postman Pat\n\nPostman Pat is a British stop-motion animated children's television series first produced by Woodland Animations.\n\nIt is aimed at pre-school children, and concerns the adventures of Pat Clifton, a postman in the fictional village of Greendale (inspired by the real valley of Longsleddale near Kendal).\n\n\"Postman Pat\"′s first 13-episode series was screened on BBC1 in 1981. John Cunliffe wrote the original treatment and scripts, and it was directed by animator Ivor Wood, who also worked on \"The Magic Roundabout\", \"The Wombles\", \"Paddington Bear\", and \"The Herbs\". Following the success of the first series, four TV specials and a second series of 13 episodes were produced during the 1990s. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films from 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series. In 2000, Royal Mail stopped using Postman Pat for their promotional and charity work. The television programme continued to use the Royal Mail logo on his postal van PAT 1 for several years after.\n\nThe original voice of Postman Pat, Ken Barrie, died on 29 July 2016.\n\nEach episode follows the adventures of Pat Clifton, a friendly country postman, and his \"black and white cat\" Jess, as he delivers the post through the valley of Greendale. Although he initially concentrates on delivering his letters, he nearly always becomes distracted by a concern of one of the villagers, and is usually relied upon to resolve their problems. Notable villagers include the postmistress, Mrs. Goggins; Alf Thompson, the farmer; and the local handyman and inventor, Ted Glen.\n\n\"Postman Pat\" is set in the fictional village of Greendale and the nearby town of Pencaster, on the border between Cumbria and North Yorkshire.\n\nGreendale is a large, busy village situated in the heart of the Cumbrian countryside. Running through the centre of the village is the High Street, home to Mrs Goggins' Post Office and shop, an unofficial meeting house for the residents. Located on the edge of the village is the railway station, home to the Greendale Rocket. Nisha Bains runs a popular café there with Sara while her husband Ajay runs a regular schedule on the Greendale Rocket to the nearby town of Pencaster. In the original series (1 and 2), Greendale consisted of windy and narrow country roads in the valley which usually had some involvement as to why Pat had problems with his rounds, as the lanes would be blocked or full of snow drifts that were not passable.\n\nPencaster is a large, bustling, modern town located within easy commuting distance for the villagers of Greendale. Situated on the waterfront, Pencaster is a hive of activity, boasting a market square in the centre surrounded by shops, houses, a large railway station, state-of-the-art buildings, and a boat jetty. It bears some resemblance to Lancaster, the county town of Lancashire, which likewise is a short commute from Longsleddale, the area used as the inspiration for Greendale.\n\nIn the second series of the show from the mid-90s, the area is referred to as Garner Bridge, and is located in Greendale. For example, in the episode \"Postman Pat and the Suit of Armour\", Greendale Post Office is referred to as \"Garner Bridge Post Office\".\n\nIngledale is another large, busy village town situated in the heart of the North Yorkshire countryside, only seen once in a special in 1991, set to make a second appearance in the revival.\n\nCunliffe, interviewed about the series, has said that he chose the character of a postman since he needed a character who could visit the countryside and interact with many different people.\n\nThe inspiration for the post office itself comes from that located on the Kendal street where Cunliffe lived when he was writing the original treatment. The post office, at 10 Greenside, closed in 2003.\n\nCunliffe did not retain rights to the character, and was disappointed by some of the tie-in media later released. He wrote the stories to the series \"Rosie and Jim\", which he also presented, as a show which he could have tighter control of.\n\nWhile Cunliffe visited post offices for inspiration, he has said that the character and village was not based on any one place or person. He commented in 2015 that \"I got maybe half a dozen people last year saying they were the inspiration.\"\n\n\n(Originally Postman Pat: SDS) In the new spin-off series, \"Postman Pat Special Delivery Service\" (SDS), Postman Pat has been promoted to Head of the SDS and is now called upon to deliver anything. Each episode follows Postman Pat on a Special Delivery mission, from rescuing a runaway cow to delivering a giant ice cube. In his new role, Postman Pat commutes to the nearby town of Pencaster where he collects his special deliveries from the Pencaster Mail Centre. Postman Pat now has a new fleet of vehicles including a helicopter, 4x4 Jeep and motorbike, complete with side-car for Jess. He has a new boss, Ben, who tends to give him instructions (whereas he was his own master before the \"promotion\"). Pat also seems to make more mistakes in his work since moving to SDS, largely because the new format is always based on one delivery, which has to go wrong somehow (thus often because of Pat's errors).\n\nPostman Pat SDS features an expanded and diverse cast, a fleet of new vehicles, a world full of gadgets and the new town of Pencaster. \"Postman Pat Special Delivery Service\" first screened on BBC2 on 29 September 2008. The new series was commissioned by the BBC and produced by Entertainment Rights and Cosgrove Hall Films.\n\nBoth seasons of Postman Pat SDS are available digitally on iTunes.\n\nA new series aired in 2016.\n\n\"\", a British-American 3D computer-animated comedy children's feature film version of the British stop-motion animated children's television show, was theatrically released on 23 May 2014 in the United Kingdom. The film was distributed and produced by Lionsgate and Icon Productions and animated by Rubicon Group Holding. The story revolves around Pat entering a talent show audition which leads to robots taking over his postal service whilst he is away. The film stars Stephen Mangan as the voice of Pat and also features Jim Broadbent, Rupert Grint, David Tennant, Ronan Keating, Susan Duerden, Sandra Teles, TJ Ramini and Peter Woodward.\n\nA CGI spin-off to the series was made called \"Guess with Jess\" which follows Pat's cat Jess now with the ability to talk and his adventures with the farm animals. The series debuted on 9 November 2009.\n\nMusic for the original 1981 series was by Bryan Daly (died January 2012), who wrote a number of songs including the well-known theme tune. For the 2003 series, pop writer Simon Woodgate scored the show and wrote new songs, including a new closing theme \"What's in His Bag?\". The theme tune \"Postman Pat & His Black and White Cat\" was sung by Ken Barrie for the original series in the 1980s and '90s. An extended version of the tune was released as a single in the UK where it reached number 44 in the charts in July 1982.\n\nThe theme tune and songs for the new series and sequel, Postman Pat Special Delivery Service (including \"Special Delivery Service, What's It Going to Be Today?), was recorded by Simon Woodgate at Echobass Studios.\n\nIn 2013 Classic Media released Postman Pat SDS Series 2. The new 26 episode series retained Bryan Daly's original theme tune and Simon Woodgate's closing song, however new character themes and incidental music was composed by Sandy Nuttgens.\n\nThere is also an album called Postman Pat: Songs And Music From The Television on Post Music released in 1982.\n\nThe ever-popular theme song underwent several adaptations; from 1994 to 1996, the theme tune had additional instruments such as synthesised strings and a tambourine. The same was done to the 1995 album version which was an edit of the original 1982 album version.\nAs of 2009, over 12 million books, including storybooks, integrated learning books, colouring books, and multi-character magazines, have been sold worldwide.\n\nThe \"Postman Pat\" characters and setting have also been used in the UK and Australia in television advertisements for the company Specsavers.\n\nTitles include:\nTitles Include:\n\nFisher Price Home Video also made a VHS with 3 episodes on it: Postman Pat's Finding Day, Postman Pat's Tractor Express and Postman Pat's Rainy Day\n\nAs \"Postman Pat\" wasn't as popular in the United States, only one DVD title, \"Postman Pat: The Movie\", was released by Paramount Pictures in 2015.\n\nWith over four million DVDs and videos sold globally, there is a growing collection of titles available for Home Entertainment release, including feature-length specials and interactive games.\nTitles include:\n\nDVD releases of classic Postman Pat were limited in availability in various regions. In the UK, only one volume with three episodes from Series 2 was released by Right Entertainment in 2004 under the title \"Postman Pat in a Muddle\". The same year saw the entire original series released on DVD in Spain, featuring both English and Spanish audio options. No further releases were seen in the UK until 2011 when Classic Media issued all four specials from 1991–1994 on the DVD \"Happy Birthday Postman Pat\". On 3 February 2014, the first and second series were made available in their entirety for the first time in the UK, However the titles are both season 2 with the season 3 theme which received bad reviews from classic fans.\n\n\nBetween April 1983 and May 1984 three Postman Pat pre-certed titles (before the Uc rating by the BBFC got established in 1985) with twelve episode of the entire first series all except for \"Letters On Ice\" [episode 11] were released by Longman Video in its \"children's treasury\" range. Also, one 30-minute title by Longman Video called \"My Own Postman Pat\" (Cat. No. LGVH 2001) was released featuring two episodes – \"Pat's Rainy Day\" [episode 3] and \"The Sheep in the Clover Field\" [episode 9].

{"id": "3829597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829597", "title": "Real time (media)", "text": "Real time (media)\n\nReal time within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip \"For Better or For Worse\", each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.\n\nReal time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical Greek drama.\n\nOften, use of split screens or picture-in-pictures are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various subplots are affecting each other. Examples include the television series \"24\" and films \"Timecode\" and \"Phone Booth\". On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.\n\n\nIn a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.\n\nIn comic books, the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the super-hero genre in American comics, and the iconic status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of floating timelines in Marvel Comics or DC Comics. Exceptions include Marvel Comics' New Universe line of books, Erik Larsen's long-running \"Savage Dragon\" ongoing series, John Byrne's \"\" (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of \"what if Superman and Batman could age?\"), and Ben Dunn's \"Ninja High School\".\n\nComic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:\n\n\nIn the Inspector Rebus series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer Ian Rankin, characters age in step with the publication date.

Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.\n\nUnlike tribute acts who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as Elvis Presley or The Beatles) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.\n\nUnlike cover bands who are primarily populist entertainers playing cover versions of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era. Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.\n\nMost revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre. Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37287", "title": "Scooby-Doo", "text": "Scooby-Doo\n\nScooby-Doo is an American animated franchise, comprising many animated television series produced from 1969 to the present day. Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created the original series, \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\", for Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured four teenagers—Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers—and their talking brown Great Dane named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps.\n\nFollowing the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.–produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of \"Scooby-Doo\" feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", from 1988 until 1991. New \"Scooby-Doo\" series aired as part of Kids' WB on The WB Network and its successor, The CW Network, from 2002 until 2008. \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013, and \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\" aired on Cartoon Network from 2015 to 2018. Repeats of the various \"Scooby-Doo\" series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network's sister channel Boomerang in the United States as well as other countries.\n\nIn 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked \"Scooby-Doo\" the fifth greatest TV cartoon.\n\nIn 1968, parent-run organizations, particularly Action for Children's Television (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons. Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as \"Space Ghost\", \"The Herculoids\" and \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\", and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups. Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\n\nFred Silverman, executive for daytime programming at CBS, was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was \"The Archie Show\", based on Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book \"Archie\". Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, \"Sugar, Sugar\", was the most successful \"Billboard\" number-one hit of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular \"I Love a Mystery\" radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\".\n\nAfter attempting to develop his own version of the show, called \"House of Mystery\", Barbera, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna produced them, passed the task along to storywriters Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, as well as artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their treatment, based in part on \"The Archie Show\", was titled \"Mysteries Five\" and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.\n\nDuring the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.\n\nRuby and Spears' second pass at the show used \"Dobie Gillis\" as the template for the teenagers rather than \"Archie\". The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W. As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became \"Ronnie\" – later renamed \"Fred\" (at Silverman's behest), Kelly became \"Daphne\", Linda \"Velma\", and W.W. \"Shaggy\". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\": Dobie Gillis, Thalia Menninger, Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs, respectively.\n\nThe revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title \"Mysteries Five\", decided to call the show \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" Silverman presented \"Who's S-S-Scared?\" to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969–70 season's Saturday morning cartoon block. CBS president Frank Stanton felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.\n\nNow without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat \"doo-be-doo-be-doo\" at the end of his recording of \"Strangers in the Night\" on a flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog \"Scooby-Doo\" and re-rechristen the show \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.\n\nThe first episode of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" \"What a Night for a Knight\" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969. The original voice cast featured veteran voice actor Don Messick as Scooby-Doo, radio DJ Casey Kasem (later host of radio's syndicated \"American Top 40\") as Shaggy, actor Frank Welker (later a veteran voice actor in his own right) as Fred, actress Nicole Jaffe as Velma, and musician Indira Stefanianna Christopherson as Daphne. Scooby's speech patterns closely resembled an earlier cartoon dog, Astro from \"The Jetsons\" (1962–63), also voiced by Messick. Seventeen episodes of \"Scooby-Doo Where are You!\" were produced in 1969–70. The series theme song was written by David Mook and Ben Raleigh, and performed by Larry Marks.\n\nEach of these episodes features Scooby and the four teenage members of Mystery, Inc.—Fred, Shaggy, Daphne and Velma—arriving at a location in the Mystery Machine, a van painted with psychedelic colors and flower power imagery. Encountering a ghost, monster, or other ostensibly supernatural creature terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and—often with the help of a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fred—they capture the villain and unmask him. Revealed as a flesh and blood crook trying to cover up crimes by using the ghost story and costume, the criminal is arrested and taken to jail, often repeating something nearly identical to \"... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!\"\n\nScheduled opposite another teenage mystery-solving show, ABC's \"The Hardy Boys\", \"Scooby-Doo\" became a ratings success, with Nielsen ratings reporting that as many as 65% of Saturday morning audiences were tuned in to CBS when \"Scooby-Doo\" was being broadcast. The show was renewed for a second season in 1970, for which eight episodes were produced. Seven of the second-season episodes featured chase sequences set to bubblegum pop songs recorded by Austin Roberts, who also re-recorded the theme song for this season. With Stefanianna Christopherson having married and retired from voice acting, Heather North assumed the role of Daphne, and would continue to voice the character until 1997.\n\nThe TV influences of \"I Love a Mystery\" and \"Dobie Gillis\" were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the \"Scooby-Doo\" teens and the \"Dobie Gillis\" teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same beatnik-style goatee, similar hairstyles, and demeanors. The core premise of \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" was also similar to Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories would often revolve around a mystery which would invariably turn out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to disguise the villain's true intent.\n\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery. Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably in the character of Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s \"Scooby-Doo\" productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability to defend herself, and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" itself would be an influence on many other Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its competitors produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including \"Josie and the Pussycats\" (1970–71), \"The Funky Phantom\" (1971–72), \"The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan\" (1972–73), \"Speed Buggy\" (1973–74), \"Goober and the Ghost Chasers\" (1973–74), \"Jabberjaw\" (1976–78), \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" (1977–80), among others.\n\nIn 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as \"Harlem Globetrotters\", \"Josie and the Pussycats\" and \"Speed Buggy\", the comic book characters Batman and Robin (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, \"Super Friends\", a year later), and celebrities such as Sandy Duncan, The Addams Family, Cass Elliot, Phyllis Diller, Don Knotts and The Three Stooges. Hanna-Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme would remain in use for much of \"Scooby-Doo's\" original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the \"New Movies\" format from 1972 to 1974, CBS began airing reruns of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" series until its option on the series ran out in 1976.\n\nNow president of ABC, Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976–77 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, \"Dynomutt, Dog Wonder\", to create \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour\" (the show became \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" when a bonus \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin Scooby-Dum, voiced by Daws Butler, as a recurring character. The voice cast was held over from \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. Pat Stevens took over her role as the voice of Velma.\n\nFor the 1977–78 season, \"The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show\" became the two-hour programming block \"Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics\" (1977–78) with the addition of \"Laff-a-Lympics\" and \"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\". In addition to eight new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the \"All-Star\" block's \"Laff-a-Lympics\" series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in \"Battle of the Network Stars\"-esque parodies of Olympic sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the \"Laff-a-Lympics\" \"Scooby Doobies\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\n\n\"Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics\" was retitled \"Scooby's All Stars\" for the 1978–79 season, reduced to 90 minutes when \"Dynomutt\" was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. \"Scooby's All-Stars\" continued broadcasting reruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of \"Scooby-Doo\" aired during a separate half-hour under the \"Scooby-Doo, Where are You!\" banner. After nine weeks, the separate \"Where are You!\" broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the \"Scooby's All-Stars\" block. The 40 total \"Scooby-Doo\" episodes produced from 1976 to 1978 were later packaged together for syndication as \"The Scooby-Doo Show\", under which title they continue to air.\n\nThe \"Scooby-Doo\" characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday morning format in \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\", an hour-long ABC television special aired in prime time on December 13, 1979. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as \"Happy Days\", \"Superman: The Movie\", \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Charlie's Angels\".\n\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew Scrappy-Doo was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost \"Scooby-Doo\"s slipping ratings. The 1979–80 episodes, aired under the new title \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. Lennie Weinrib voiced Scrappy in the 1979–80 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter. Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\n\nAs a result of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's\" success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute \"Scooby and Scrappy\" cartoons, who in previous \"Scooby\" series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real within the context of the series.\n\nThis version of \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of \"The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show\", an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new \"Richie Rich\" cartoon, adapted from the Harvey Comics character. From 1982 to 1983, \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" were part of \"The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour\", a co-production with Ruby-Spears Productions which featured two \"Scooby and Scrappy\" shorts, a \"Scrappy and Yabba-Doo\" short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his Western deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and \"The Puppy's New Adventures\", based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.\n\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of \"Scooby-Doo\" were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles \"Scooby-Doo Classics\", \"Scary Scooby Funnies\", \"The Best of Scooby-Doo\", and \"Scooby's Mystery Funhouse\", the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with \"The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show\" in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\n\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title \"The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries\". The 1984–85 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\n\n1985 saw the debut of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\", which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by Susan Blu) and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by Vincent Price) traveling the globe to capture \"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\" The final first-run episode of \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\" aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new \"Scooby\" series aired on the network for the next two years.\n\nHanna-Barbera reincarnated the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" cast as elementary school students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", which debuted on ABC in 1988. \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original \"Scooby\" series for a more \"Looney Tunes\"-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later \"Scooby\" productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\n\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" was developed and produced by Tom Ruegger, who had been the head story editor on \"Scooby-Doo\" since 1983. Following the first season of \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation to develop \"Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures\" and later \"Animaniacs\", \"Pinky and the Brain\", and \"Freakazoid!\".\n\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced \"Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10\", a series of syndicated TV movies featuring their most popular characters, including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: \"Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers\" (1987), \"Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School\" (1988), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf\" (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie \"Arabian Nights\", originally broadcast by TBS in 1994, Don Messick's final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\n\nReruns of \"Scooby-Doo\" have been in syndication since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS Superstation (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT. Canadian network Teletoon began airing \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" in 1997, with the other \"Scooby\" series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, \"Scooby-Doo\" became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.\n\nWith \"Scooby-Doo's\" restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation and Hanna-Barbera (by then a subsidiary of Warner Bros. following the merger of Time Warner and Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new \"Scooby-Doo\" direct-to-video movie a year beginning in 1998. These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" days. The first four DTV entries were \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\" (1998), \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" (1999), \"Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders\" (2000), and \"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 Burger King commercial. Therefore, Scott Innes took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy (Billy West voiced Shaggy in \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\"). B.J. Ward took over as Velma, and Mary Kay Bergman voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by Grey DeLisle.\n\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\", featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting voodoo-worshiping cat creatures in the Louisiana bayou. \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost\" featured an author (voice of Tim Curry) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. \"The Witch's Ghost\" introduced a goth rock band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the \"Scooby-Doo\" franchise.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\" was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company Warner Bros. Animation following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation would continue production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new \"Scooby-Doo\" series for television.\n\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire\" and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico\" (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\", using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical \"Scooby-Doo\" films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named \"Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood\" and \"\".\n\nIn addition, a live-action TV movie, \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\", was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut. The film starred Nick Palatas as Shaggy, Robbie Amell as Fred, Kate Melton as Daphne, Hayley Kiyoko as Velma, and Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo. A second live-action TV movie, \"Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster\", retained the same cast and aired on October 16, 2010 and a direct-to-video spin-off \"Daphne & Velma\" in 2018. The three films serve as prequels taking place before the events of the 2002 film.\n\nA feature-length live-action film version of \"Scooby-Doo\" was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 14, 2002. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the film starred Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Scooby-Doo, voiced by Neil Fanning, was created on-screen by computer-generated special effects. \"Scooby-Doo\" was a financially successful release, with a domestic box office gross of over US$130 million.\n\nA sequel, \"\", followed in March 2004 with the same cast and director. \"Scooby-Doo 2\" earned US$84 (€55,98) million at the U.S. box office. A third film was planned, but later scrapped following Warner Bros.' disappointment at the returns from \"Scooby-Doo 2\".\n\nAs of 2013, Warner Bros. Pictures was developing a fully animated Scooby-Doo feature film with Atlas Entertainment. Charles Roven and Richard Suckle, who produced the first two live-action films, were producing the animated film, and Matt Lieberman was writing the film.\n\nAs of 2014, Warner Bros. was restarting the film series with Randall Green writing a new movie.\n\nAs of 2015, Warner Bros. had Tony Cervone directing an animated film, with Allison Abbate as producer and Dan Povenmire as executive producer. Originally planned for a September 21, 2018 release, it was later pushed back to May 15, 2020, with Dax Shepard co-directing and co-writing. The film, titled \"S.C.O.O.B.\", is intended as the first film in a \"Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe\".\n\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, \"Scooby-Doo\" returned to Saturday morning for the first time in 17 years with \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\", which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\n\nBeginning with this series, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's voice actor, while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well. Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, on the condition that the character be depicted as a vegetarian like Kasem himself. Grey DeLisle continued to voice Daphne, and former \"Facts of Life\" star Mindy Cohn voiced Velma. The series was produced by Chuck Sheetz, who had worked on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nAfter three seasons, \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\" was replaced in September 2006 with \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\", a major revamping of the series which debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the \"Austin Powers \"series, and named after Vincent Price's character from \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\"), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\" ran for two seasons on The CW.\n\nThe next \"Scooby\" series, \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\", premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010. The first \"Scooby\" series produced for cable television, \"Mystery Incorporated\" is a reboot of the franchise, re-establishing the characters' relationships, personalities, and locations, and expanding their world to feature their parents, high school, and neighbors. The series also borrowed pieces from many parts of \"Scooby-Doo's\" long history, as well as characters and elements of other Hanna-Barbera shows to form its back story and the bases of some of its episodes. Matthew Lillard was brought over from the direct-to-video series as the new voice of Shaggy, while Welker, Cohn, and DeLisle continued in their respective roles. Patrick Warburton, Linda Cardellini, Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Gary Cole, Udo Kier, Tim Matheson, Tia Carrere, and Kate Higgins were added as new semi-regular cast members. Casey Kasem appeared in a recurring role as Shaggy's father, one of his last roles before retiring due to declining health.\n\nThe series, while still following the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated televised novel and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure shows such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Lost.\" An overarching mystery surrounding the gang's hometown of Crystal Cove, California became the series' main story arc, with pieces to the mystery unfolding episode by episode. Also featured were romantic entanglements and interpersonal conflict between the lead characters. The series ran for 52 episodes over two seasons, with a three-part finale airing across April 4 and 5, 2013 – exactly three years from the debut.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Cartoon Network announced several new series based on classic cartoons, including a new Scooby-Doo animated series titled \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\". The show features the gang \"living it up\" the summer after the gang's senior year of high school. Along the way, they run into monsters and mayhem. The series premiered October 5, 2015 on Cartoon Network and concluded on March 18, 2018.\n\nOn May 23, 2018, Boomerang announced that a new Scooby-Doo series titled \"Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?\" is scheduled to be released sometime in 2019. The series is currently slated to air on the Boomerang streaming service and app. The series will feature the Mystery Inc. gang teaming up with a variety of guest stars to solve mysteries. Confirmed guest stars include Halsey, Sia, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Mark Hamill, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ricky Gervais, Kenan Thompson and Chris Paul. The series will also include fictional guest stars, including Jaleel White as Steve Urkel, Kevin Conroy as Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Warner Bros. Animation began producing direct-to-video special episodes in the style of the concurrently produced films for inclusion on \"Scooby-Doo\" compilation DVD sets otherwise including episodes from previous Scooby series. These include \"Scooby-Doo! Spooky Games\", included on the July 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! Laff-A-Lympics: Spooky Games\", \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted Holidays\", from the October 2012 release \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Holiday Chills and Thrills\", and \"Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow\" and \"Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace\", from the September 2013 DVD releases \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Run for Your 'Rife!\" and \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Ruh-Roh Robot!\". On May 13, 2014, another episode, \"Scooby-Doo! Ghastly Goals\" was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Field of Screams\" DVD. On May 5, 2015, \"Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie\", the sixth direct-to-video special, was released on the \"Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surf's Up Scooby-Doo\" DVD.\n\n\nGold Key Comics began publication of \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" comic books in December 1969. The comics initially contained adaptations of episodes of the television show drawn by Phil DeLara, Jack Manning and Warren Tufts. The comic books later moved to all-original stories until ending with issue #30 in 1974. Several of these issues were written by Mark Evanier and drawn by Dan Spiegle. Charlton published \"Scooby\" comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, for 11 issues in 1975. From 1977 to 1979, Marvel Comics published nine issues of \"Scooby-Doo\", all written by Evanier and drawn by Spiegel. Harvey Comics published reprints of the Charlton comics, as well as a handful of special issues, between 1993 and 1994.\n\nIn 1995, Archie Comics began publishing a monthly \"Scooby-Doo\" comic book, the first year of which featured Scrappy-Doo among its cast. Evanier and Spiegel worked on three issues of the series, which ended after 21 issues in 1997 when Warner Bros.' DC Comics acquired the rights to publish comics based on Hanna-Barbera characters. DC's \"Scooby-Doo\" series continues publication to this day. In 2013, DC began a digital bi-monthly comic book titled \"Scooby-Doo Team-Up\", crossing over Mystery Inc. with other DC and Hanna-Barbera characters. Since then, the series has become a monthly comic book available in print.\n\nIn 2004, a limited series of a 100 comic books called \"Scooby-Doo! World of Mystery\" was released. In each issue, Mystery Inc. go from country to country solving mysteries. Each issue came with a pack of exclusive cards, with 350 in total able to be collected.\n\nIn 2016, DC launched a new monthly comic book entitled \"Scooby Apocalypse\", with the characters being reinvented in a story set in a post-apocalyptic world, where monsters roam the streets and Scooby and the gang must find a way to survive at all costs, while also trying to find a way to reverse the apocalypse.\n\nEarly \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise included a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, decorated lunch boxes, iron-on transfers, coloring books, story books, records, underwear, and other such goods. When Scrappy-Doo was introduced to the series in 1979, he, Scooby, and Shaggy became the foci of much of the merchandising, including a 1983 Milton-Bradley \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\" board game. The first \"Scooby-Doo\" video game appeared in arcades in 1986, and has been followed by a number of games for both home consoles and personal computers. \"Scooby-Doo \"multivitamins also debuted at this time, and have been manufactured by Bayer since 2001.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" merchandising tapered off during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but increased after the series' revival on Cartoon Network in 1995. Today, all manner of \"Scooby-Doo\"-branded products are available for purchase, including \"Scooby-Doo\" breakfast cereal, plush toys, action figures, car decorations, and much more. Real \"Scooby Snacks\" dog treats are produced by Del Monte Pet Products. Hasbro has created a number of \"Scooby\" board games, including a \"Scooby\"-themed edition of the popular mystery board game \"Clue\". In 2007, the Pressman Toy Corporation released the board game \"Scooby-Doo! Haunted House\". Beginning in 2001, a \"Scooby-Doo\" children's book series was authorized and published by Scholastic. These books, written by Suzanne Weyn, include original stories and adaptations of \"Scooby\" theatrical and direct-to-video features.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2002, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo appeared as characters in the \"Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida. The ride was replaced in the early 2000s with a \"Jimmy Neutron\" attraction, and \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" instead became an attraction at several properties operated by Paramount Parks. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are currently costumed characters at Universal Studios Florida, and can be seen driving the Mystery Machine around the park.\n\nIn 2001, \"Scooby-Doo in Stagefright\", a live stage play based upon the series, began touring across the world. A follow-up, \"Scooby-Doo and the Pirate Ghost\", followed in 2009.\n\nThe Mystery Machine has been used as the basis for many die-cast models and toys, such as from hotwheels.\n\nBy 2004, the various \"Scooby-Doo\" merchandise had generated over in profit for Warner Bros. Licensed merchandise also sold in 2015, in 2016, and in 2017.\n\nDuring its four decade broadcast history, \"Scooby-Doo\" has received two Emmy nominations: a 1989 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\", and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for \"What's New, Scooby-Doo\"s Mindy Cohn in the \"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\" category. Science advocate Carl Sagan favorably compared the predominantly skeptic oriented formula to that of most television dealing with paranormal themes, and considered that an adult analogue to \"Scooby-Doo\" would be a great public service.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series. Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success. As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, \"Scooby-Doo\"s ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. \"Overall, [\"Scooby-Doo\" is] just not a show that is going to overstimulate kids' emotions and tensions,\" offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview. \"It creates just enough fun to make it fun without getting them worried or giving them nightmares.\n\nOlder teenagers and adults have admitted to enjoying \"Scooby-Doo\" because of presumed subversive themes which involve theories of drug use and sexuality, in particular that Shaggy is assumed to be a user of cannabis and Velma is assumed to be a lesbian. Such themes were pervasive enough in popular culture to find their way into Warner Bros.' initial \"Scooby-Doo\" feature film in 2002, though several of the scenes were edited before release to secure a family-friendly \"PG\" rating. Series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears reported that they \"took umbrage\" to the inclusion of such themes in the \"Scooby-Doo\" feature and other places, and denied intending their characters to be drug users in any way.\n\nLike many Hanna-Barbera shows, the early \"Scooby-Doo\" series have been criticized at times for their production values and storytelling. In 2002, Jamie Malanowski of the \"New York Times\" commented that \"[\"Scooby-Doo\"s] mysteries are not very mysterious, and the humor is hardly humorous. As for the animation—well, the drawings on your refrigerator may give it competition.\"\n\nBy the 2000s, \"Scooby-Doo\" had received recognition for its popularity by placing in a number of top cartoon or top cartoon character polls. The August 3, 2002, issue of \"TV Guide\" featured its list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time, in which Scooby-Doo placed twenty-second. Scooby also ranked thirteenth in Animal Planet's list of the 50 Greatest TV Animals. For one year from 2004 to 2005, \"Scooby-Doo\" held the Guinness World Record for having the most episodes of any animated television series ever produced, a record previously held by and later returned to \"The Simpsons\". \"Scooby-Doo\" was published as holding this record in the 2006 edition of the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\nIn January 2009, entertainment website IGN named \"Scooby-Doo\" #24 on its list of the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.\n\nAs with most popular franchises, \"Scooby-Doo\" has been parodied and has done parodies.\n\n\n"}

The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight (\"cold reading\"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.\n\nScreen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of costume, make-up and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films.\n\nInternational actors such as Bruce Lee were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee's case, for the role of Kato in \"The Green Hornet\", he was asked to converse about Chinese culture in English to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some martial arts moves to show off his physical skills.\n\n"}
{"id": "1037487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1037487", "title": "She-tragedy", "text": "She-tragedy\n\nThe term she-tragedy, also known as \"pathetic tragedy\" refers to a vogue in the late 17th and early 18th centuries for tragic plays focused on the sufferings of a woman, sometimes innocent and virtuous but often a woman who has committed some sort of sexual sin. Prominent she-tragedies include Thomas Otway's \"The Orphan\" (1680), John Banks' \"Virtue Betrayed, or, Anna Bullen\" (1682), Thomas Southerne's \"The Fatal Marriage\" (1694) and Nicholas Rowe's \"The Fair Penitent\" (1703) and \"Lady Jane Grey\" (1715). Rowe was the first to use the term \"she-tragedy,\" in 1714.\n\nWhen English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic drama which celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of Elizabeth Barry in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's \"The Orphan\", she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.\n\nThe realm of pathetic tragedy became an exploration of the female experience as the private female sphere, that of the domestic, was put on the stage and publicized. The she-tragedies demonstrated the psychology and behavior of women in their private sphere and presented it for public consideration, a new concept that emerged as women began to star in main roles instead of only supporting characters. For the first time, plays were written that had a woman as the main character and that followed her experiences and emotions. She-tragedies brought what was once solely internal (emotions and thoughts) out for external display. The rise of pathetic tragedy commodified the female experience and women themselves with the transition from men (dressed as women) playing the female roles to women acting on the stage themselves. Actresses, while not unusual in Continental Europe, were just beginning to be accepted as a novelty by the predominantly male audience. The idea of the woman, occupier of the private sphere, as a public figure was bizarre. As a result, actresses often had a bad moral reputation as before the Restoration, public women were immoral women. However, royal sanction gave actresses more opportunities and opened the way for new dramatic possibilities.\n\nShe tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman. Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims. The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy. Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered. The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her \n\"\"Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul;\nBut n the morning when you call me to you\nAs by your bed I stand and tell you stories,\nI am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, \nIt makes me blush, they are so very white\".\" (1.221-25)\nHere Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.\n\nWhile she-tragedies were highly entertaining to the public, playwrights would also use them to voice political opinions. In Rowe's \"Jane Grey\" the character Jane represents a symbol of virtue whose desires are second to the political good. During the 1690s the rape in she-tragedies leaned towards Whig beliefs and became a symbol for the justification for displacing proper rule. The spectacle of rape within the tragedy was used to convey the belief that the sexual assault on the female victim was a visual representation of assault on the subjects' liberties.\n\nOne reason that the Carolinian court was more accepting of the addition of women to the world of theater was the experience of the new monarch, Charles II, before he ascended to the throne. As part of the English Civil War, the previous monarch, Charles II's father Charles I, was executed, sending his sons into exile. Charles II spent much of his exile abroad in France, living as part of the French court and learning French tastes and manners. Although practically unheard of in England, it was not uncommon for women to take part in French and Italian theater, which Charles II would have been exposed to. As a result, when he returned to England, Charles II did not have the same qualms as his countrymen when it came to the more public presence of women.\n\nIn addition, in 1662, a law was passed that women's roles were to be played by women and no longer by men. It is speculated that this change was at least partially due to the influence of the Puritans, who \"took offence\" at men cross-dressing to play women, something that goes against a verse from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. Ironically, this attempt to reclaim morality in theater led to further scandals as the practice of \"breeches roles\" developed. These were roles played by woman while wearing men's clothing, either as part of a disguise required by the script or to give the actresses more license to behave as society allowed men to. These roles, while part of elaborate plot, were sometimes used to exploit the physical aspects of women as men's clothing did not disguise the body's form as much as the dresses traditionally worn by women.\n\nThe new focus on women in tragedy may be linked with a growing political disillusion with the old aristocratic ideology and its traditional masculine ideals (see Staves). Other possible explanations for the great interest in she-tragedy are the popularity of Mary II, who often ruled alone in the 1690s while her husband William III was on the Continent, and the publication of \"The Spectator\", the first periodical aimed at women. Elizabeth Howe has argued that the most important explanation for the shift in taste was the emergence of tragic actresses whose popularity made it unavoidable for dramatists to create major roles for them. With the conjunction of the playwright \"master of pathos\" Thomas Otway and the great tragedienne Elizabeth Barry in \"The Orphan\", the focus shifted decisively from hero to heroine.\n\n"}
{"id": "2753498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2753498", "title": "Single rider", "text": "Single rider\n\nSingle rider lines are an opportunity at various theme parks to reduce the amount of time waiting in line for an attraction. When a single-rider line is in use, empty seats on the ride vehicles are filled using individuals from the line, thus ensuring that every vehicle is carrying the maximum number of occupants possible. A park using a single-rider line offers guests a chance to wait for a significantly shorter length of time in exchange for not necessarily being able to experience the attraction with others in their party or from a desired seat (e.g., the front row of a roller coaster).\n\nIn practice, a single-rider line is available adjacent to the main entrance of the attraction. It is often manned by a park employee who will remind guests of any important policies. The line may bypass pre-show elements of the attraction; again, this is a trade-off that allows a much shorter wait in line. Typically, the line ends at the loading platform, where another employee is stationed. This employee will sort out the arriving guests from the main line and direct them to the ride vehicles. When an empty seat becomes available, the employee will direct the person at the front of the single-rider line to take the empty seat.\n\nThe actual movement of the line is subject to many variables, including the loading speed of the attraction and, sometimes, the park's management style for dealing with such lines. Some parks will use single riders to fill odd-numbered seating configurations every time, while others will actively attempt to balance out the ride vehicle with guests in the main line, even inviting guests from further back in the main line to come forward and board. Generally, single rider lines are used for rides which have vehicles of four to eight people and are popular. Single rider lines can reduce wait times by 80% or more. Some rides may seat three individuals across, and due to the number of couples that visit theme parks, the third individual is needed to fill the row. Because single rider lines are normally used to fill up otherwise empty seats, they have no direct, negative impact on the main queue. This is different from paid priority queues, in which visitors are allowed to jump the main queue for an upcharge, taking away available rides.\n\nIn most cases, a guest using a single-rider line must meet the normal rider requirements for the attraction and must be able to ride in any empty seat presented. Therefore, a number of park guests are generally discouraged from using these lines, such as:\n\nSingle-rider lines may be discontinued at the discretion of the park at any time, usually when there is no perceivable benefit to using the line. This can occur during off-peak operating days when the regular wait is very short already. Similarly, it may be temporarily discontinued when the single-rider line length creates waits that are longer than those for the regular line.\n\nSome parks provide provisions for visitors who are alone, regardless of whether a \"single-rider line\" is designated.\n\nAlthough not specifically a single-rider plan, some parks provide provisions for parents of children who are too small or young for an attraction. One party waits with the non-riders, until a responsible adult returns, then the waiting party enters the front of the single-rider line or another line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of dramatic monologue, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in poetry and drama, but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary. It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a tragedy. The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist Bryan Lewis Saunders in 2005. For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a malapropism for the stream of consciousness.\n\nThe audio recordings of Dion McGregor (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such. \"Dreams\" (1995) by contemporary American artist Jim Shaw is a collection of illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions. \"Experiment with Dreams\" by Leif Elggren and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.\n\nExamples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:\n\n"}

{"id": "416735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416735", "title": "Summer stock theatre", "text": "Summer stock theatre\n\nIn American theater, summer stock theatre is a theatre that presents stage productions only in the summer. The name combines the season with the tradition of staging shows by a resident company, reusing stock scenery and costumes. Summer stock theatres frequently take advantage of seasonal weather by having their productions outdoors or under tents set up temporarily for their use.\n\nSome smaller theatres still continue this tradition, and a few summer stock theatres have become highly regarded by both patrons as well as performers and designers. Equity status and pay for actors in these theatres varies greatly. Often viewed as a starting point for professional actors, stock casts are typically young, just out of high school or still in college.\n\nSummer stock started in 1919-1920s with four theatres: The Muny, St. Louis, Mo. (1919) is the nation's oldest and largest outdoor musical theatre; Manhattan Theatre Colony, first started near Peterborough, New Hampshire (1927) and moved to Ogunquit, Maine; the Cape Playhouse, Dennis, Massachusetts (1927); and the Berkshire Playhouse, Stockbridge, Massachusetts (1928). Many of the theatres of the heyday, the 1920s through the 1960s, were in New England. Part of the \"straw hat circuit,\" theatres also were in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, among other states. (There had been earlier summer theatres: the Gardens Theatre, Denver (1890) and Lakewood Playhouse near Skowhegan, Maine (1901 for summer), but they were established stock theatres that had then been used as a summer venue.)\n\nThe structure was to present different plays in weekly or biweekly repertory, performed by a resident company, generally between June and September. The usual fare consisted of light comedies, romances and mysteries. The theatres were located in rural areas. Touring companies would carry hand props and costumes to each venue, where sound, lights and set would be awaiting them.\n\nSummer stock provided a training ground for actors and inexpensive entertainment for vacationing East Coast urbanites. Craig Mamrick describes Louis Edmonds' early summer stock experience: \"Louis spent the summer of 1949 working as part of the repertory company at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine...The Ogunquit Playhouse was affiliated with the Manhattan Theatre Colony, an apprentice program that hopeful actors could attend (paying $150 for the summer) to learn their craft and observe—and possibly work with—professionals. Such stage luminaries as Maude Adams, Ethel Barrymore, Lilian Gish, and Ruth Gordon had trod the boards here. Students took classes in acting, stagecraft, makeup, and voice, and if they were talented enough, they might be asked to appear in plays with the resident acting company.\" Additionally, many notable performers spent their summers on the circuit. Plays and musicals that had closed on Broadway would play the circuit. By 1950, there were 152 Equity companies, including the Ogunquit Playhouse and Skowhegan Playhouse in Maine; the Woodstock Playhouse and the Forestburgh Playhouse in upstate New York; Falmouth Playhouse in Massachusetts (burned down in 1994); Priscilla Beach Theatre in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope (suburban Philadelphia), Pennsylvania (established in 1939). The Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut, since renovated with the support of Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, was also part of the summer stock circuit.\n\nThe circuit toured in Florida and the Southeast during the winter. Venues included the Beacham Theater in Orlando and the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, Florida (closed since 2004) where performers from Bob Cummings in 1958 to Arlene Francis (1961) and Richard Chamberlain (1966) appeared.\n\nStars of Broadway, film, and television would regularly spend summers performing in stock. The Council of Stock Theatres (COST) negotiated a special contract with Actors Equity to cover the work of actors and stage managers.\n\nJohn Kenley, an Ohio-based producer, ran his own summer stock circuit, Kenley Players, in Columbus, Dayton, Warren, the Carousel Theatre in Akron, and Canton, Ohio, and sent many of the shows to an affiliated theatre in Flint, Michigan. Starting in 1958 performers such as Dan Dailey in \"Guys and Dolls\", Barbara Eden in \"Lady in the Dark\", and Howard Keel in \"Kismet\" appeared. Kenley cast \"movie stars and television personalities\" who were nationally known. During Gypsy Rose Lee's engagement in \"Auntie Mame\" at the Warren theatre, Erik Preminger wrote: \"Working for him [John Kenley] was a joy. Everything about his operation was first-class from the director and supporting cast he had assembled through the scenery, props, and costumes...He was attentive, supportive.\" Performers such as Paul Lynde, Bill Bixby, Karen Morrow, Phyllis Diller, Andy Devine, Gordon MacRae and Patrice Munsel starred in Kenley stock productions. Ethel Merman performed in \"Call Me Madam\" at the Kenley Players in 1968 (as well as appearing at the Parker Playhouse and Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami earlier that year).\n\nThe Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts opened in 1927 with \"The Guardsman\", starring Basil Rathbone, and has continued through the 2009 season with Hunter Foster and Malcolm Gets.\n\nThe Ogunquit Playhouse, begun in 1933, attracted performers such as Maude Adams, Ethel Barrymore, and Laurette Taylor in the early years and more recently, Sally Struthers, Lucie Arnaz, and Lorenzo Lamas.\n\nPerformers such as Ginger Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Angela Lansbury, Bob Hope, Sergio Franchi, Zero Mostel, Ann Miller, Jane Powell, and Debbie Reynolds performed at the Cape Cod Music Circus and its sister theatre, the South Shore Music Circus.\n\nColleen Dewhurst wrote of her experiences in summer stock as a new actress: \"My first professional jobs were in summer stock, in small, medium and large companies that presented ten plays in ten weeks from June until Labor Day...At that time, the core of each summer stock company was made up of a stage manager and six resident actors: a leading man and woman, a character man and woman, and an ingenue and a juvenile. In some cases, five or six of the summer plays would be 'star vehicles', featuring a familiar actor or actress.\"\n\nWilliam Shatner performed in summer stock after the cancellation of \"\".\n\nSome summer theatres specialize in a particular type of production, such as Shakespearean plays, musicals, or even opera. Some notable summer theatres include: Oregon Shakespeare Festival Ashland, Oregon, Rocky Mountain Repertory Theatre, Grand Lake, Colorado, Utah Shakespearean Festival, Cedar City, Utah, Santa Fe Opera, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Becket, Massachusetts, Williamstown Theatre Festival, Williamstown, Massachusetts, Berkshire Theatre Festival, Stockbridge, Massachusetts, Glimmerglass Opera, Cooperstown, New York, The Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan and Vancouver's Bard on the Beach.\n\nIn 1949, St. John Terrell began a new experience presenting summer stock theatre under an arena-type (circus) tent in Lambertville, New Jersey, the Music circus. This began a new period of outdoor theatre. In 1951 this new style of summer stock made its way west with the addition of the Sacramento Music Circus.\n\nThe Cape Cod Music Circus (now the Melody Tent) in Hyannis, Massachusetts opened in 1950, the third tent theatre to open, and The South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset, Massachusetts followed in 1951. A tent theatre had opened earlier in Florida.\nAnother theatre in the round, the Valley Forge Music Fair (which closed in 1996), in Devon, Pennsylvania, was opened in 1955 by Shelly Gross, Lee Guber and Frank Ford. They then opened other theatres in the round, including Shady Grove Music Fair in Washington, DC, Painters Mill Music Fair in Maryland (closed in 1991), and the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island, opened in 1956. By 1957, there were 19 tent theatres, many located in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, and all presenting musicals only. (The musical \"The Pajama Game\" was the major show making the tent circuit in the summer of 1957.)\n\nThe theatre in the round concept brought Broadway-style musicals to northern California under a big top tent each summer. Original producers Russell Lewis and Howard Young presented their first production, \"Show Boat\", the same opening production at both the Lambertville and the South Shore Music Circus. The original Lambertville theatre closed in 1970, and both the Sacramento and South Shore theatres continue to thrive today. In Sacramento, live musicals in the round are presented in a new permanent complex, The Wells Fargo Pavilion. The South Shore Music Circus and Cape Cod Melody Tent now serve primarily as intimate settings for musical acts including popular singers, oldies groups, and orchestras.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4463773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4463773", "title": "Tactical media", "text": "Tactical media\n\nTactical media is a term coined in 1996, to denote a form of media activism that privileges temporary, hit-and-run interventions in the media sphere over the creation of permanent and alternative media outlets. Tactical media describes interventionist media art practices that engage and critique the dominant political and economic order. They were first popularized in Europe and the United States by media theorists and practitioners such as David Garcia, Geert Lovink, Joanne Richardson, and the Critical Art Ensemble. Since then, it has been used to describe the practices of a vast array of art and activist groups such as RTMark, The Yes Men, Electronic Disturbance Theater, Carbon Defense League, Institute for Applied Autonomy, 0100101110101101.ORG, Bureau of Inverse Technology, Ubermorgen, The Illuminator, Irational.org, subRosa, and I/O/D, among others.\n\nAlthough tactical media borrows from a number of artistic and political movements, it has been suggested that much of its techniques are rooted in the Situationist idea of detournement, that is, in the critical appropriation and transformation of a preexisting work—be it an artwork, a commercial billboard, or a political campaign. In the case of tactical media, it is the media themselves to be the subject of a detournement.\n\nThe dada movement has also been credited as an influence on tactical media, the two often used within activist campaigns. Much like it, tactical media often aims to do the opposite of the media it penetrates: it shocks and reveals an antithesis.\n\nTactical media also draws from surrealism, borrowing the idea that a \"truer\" experience than the present one is present. Much like surrealism, tactical media also criticizes social, political and cultural elements of a given society through its domain's techniques.\n\nAs for media-related roots, tactical media partly stem from the alternative media created by the counterculture of the 1960s. However, due do their temporary nature, tactical media do not tend to construct alternative media outlets, but rather appropriate existing media channels and technology to transform their usage and/or the popular understanding of their messages. In this respect, tactical media are more akin to other temporary forms of cultural and political intervention, such as guerrilla communication and culture jamming.\n\nTactical media is said to have risen following the fall of the Berlin Wall, where a certain rebirth of social, political, economical and media activism occurred. This activist spirit soon reached both media specialists and artists, creating the groundwork of tactical media. In many ways, it was made possible by the availability of cheaper technology and by open forms of distribution, such as public-access television and the Internet. Through tactical media, participants are able to attract attention to an issue they feel strongly about and want society to be aware of or get involved in.\n\nMost who have written about tactical media would agree that its current form and meaning come from French philosopher Michel de Certeau, more specifically in his 1984 essay \"The Practice of Everyday Life\". As part of this essay, De Certeau debated that consumers actually act as producers within our society, moving in a technocratically constructed space and using an already established vocabulary. The importance to De Certeau is that these practices \"determines the elements used, but not the 'phrasing' produced by the bricolage (the artisan-like inventiveness) and the discursiveness that combine these elements, which are all in general circulation.\" This distinction between the elements used within a society and the system under which they are used is critical to the study of tactical media. In his essay, De Certeau appeared to suggest that one could easily use these social elements in a creative manner that would fall outside of the system under which they are to be used.\n\nOnce this distinction was made, De Certeau also pushed forward the idea of how the elements found within a society could be used. One of these was to use them as a \"tactic\", which he believed to \"[insinuate] itself into the other's place, fragmentarily, without taking it over in its entirety, without being able to keep it at a distance. It has at its disposal no base where it can capitalize on its advantages, prepare its expansions, and secure independence with respect to circumstances\". Due to its lack of space, he also characterized a tactic to be dependent on time, needing to be constantly on the watch for opportunities that must be quickly seized or needing to manipulate events in order to turn them into opportunities.\n\nBy mixing the nature of tactics with the use of media, a new type of activism was created. It used elements of a particular system in a creative manner that fell outside its practices, creating resistance through difference. De Certeau's concept of a tactic also explains why most tactical media campaigns are quick, effective and current.\n\nHowever, successful a particular campaign or a particular group may be, its ultimate goal is not to replace a certain media outlet, for tactical media discourages branding because of the probable outcome that a similar cycle as the one attacked would be created once again. It must therefore be understood that tactical media never reaches a state of perfection; it is constantly changing, because it constantly needs to question the system under which it operates.\n\nAlthough it is possible for tactical media to be representative of the local views of a specific area, it is usually present on a global level. There are plenty of tactical media projects that operate on a physical space, but it most often uses networked space and the Internet, making its span stretch over the entire planet. The virtual nature of the space it occupies also allows it to create new channels towards the hierarchies of power it fights against. A certain tactic does not need to attack in person or on a physical level, but it can attack virtual and free space where the dominant have little control. This important element makes a tactical media project not the work of certain identifiable individuals but an entity in itself, which most likely helps convey the message it attempts to communicate.\n\nTactical media projects are often a mix between art and activism, which explains why many of its roots can be traced to various art movements. It has been suggested by tactical media theorist Geert Lovink that \"discourse plus art equals spectacle\", reflecting its striking and memorable nature. Although there are no strict mediums through which it operates, tactical media can often have very high aesthetic value, adding to its \"spectacle\" and reinforcing some of its artistic roots.\n\nIn 1998, computer programmer and political activist Zack Exley purchased a domain and created a website titled GWbush.com. He invited the group RTMark (pronounced Art Mark) to build a copy of George W. Bush's official website, as they had done for some corporate websites.\n\nLater, Zack Exley changed the website to be a more mainstream satire (drawing criticism from RTMark), posting a fake press release from the Bush campaign announcing a promise to \"pardon all drug prisoners as long as they've learned from their past mistakes\". In the midst of Bush's campaign for office, the website not only received millions of hits, but also received coverage from such organizations as ABC News, \"USA Today\" and \"Newsweek\". This phenomenon can be classified as tactical media because of its conformance to its corresponding criteria.\n\nIn 2000, Mexico's Zapatista Army of National Liberation social movement decided to launch a \"tactical air force\". The Zapatistas' air force consisted of hundreds of paper airplanes. After throwing the planes over the fence of a federal barrack, confused troops were quick to point their rifles at the paper intruders, creating an image that conveyed a very strong message of peace versus war—the target ultimately being the government.\n\nThe Yes Men are an organization who mimic their subject through certain media: examples include counterfeiting sites and creating fake videos. They will mimic their criticized subject, designed to fool the general public into believing their alternate identity. Examples of organizations and corporations that The Yes Men have successfully impersonated (and criticized) are Dow Chemicals, ExxonMobil, McDonald's, World Trade Organization, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), \"The New York Times\" and Heritage.\n\nAll of The Yes Men's media operate in a similar fashion: they will impersonate a powerful entity, and publicize or make decisions based on their own personal viewpoint. One of the most controversial but widely known works that The Yes Men have produced is a humorous video spoof where they impersonated a World Trade Organization representative, asking corporations to buy votes directly from the general public. Some other ideas that they publicized in this video spoof include the present-day influence dating from the Civil War, encouraging the idea of reviving slavery.\n\nThese video spoofs are meant to evoke emotions of outrage and absurdity. They were once successful enough to fool the public to the extent where they were able to be interviewed by CNN—however, CNN was unaware of the true identity of The Yes Men.\n\n\"An example of Yes Men:\"\n\nIn April 2010, a radical Islamic group, Revolution Muslim, made threats to South Park creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, after they were offended of the show depicting their prophet Mohammed. As a tactical media rebuttal, unknown agents created a site with a similar URL to Revolution Muslim's website showing images of a controversial comic of Mohammed (The comic shows Mohammed with a bomb as his turban and sparked a huge controversy in 2006). as well as a highly regarded Islamic leader kissing an Islamic child on the mouth. This website was intended to draw visitors who incorrectly typed in the URL to the Islamic website. This tactic was aiming to mock Islamic radicals who use violent tactics to get their way and then get offended that they are stereotyped as violent.\n\nBrett Gaylor, an avid Web activist, created a documentary entitled \"RiP: A Remix Manifesto\", which was dedicated to defending deejay Girl Talk, who had been accused by top record labels with copyright infringement. Although Girl Talk samples songs from other artists, Gaylor suggests that copyrights should be distributed according to the creator of the music as a whole, rather than who holds the ownership for specific songs. Moreover, he argues that Girl Talk should be the owner of the mash-ups that he created, despite ownership conflicts. This represents tactical media well, because an ordinary person with a mindset can create a temporary power of reversal with Girl Talk's adversaries.\n\nVideo games have opened a whole new approach and canvas for tactical media artists. This form of media allows for a wide range of audiences to be informed on a specific issue or idea. Some examples of games that touch on Tactical Media are \"Darfur is Dying\" and \"September 12\". One example of a game design studio that works in tactical media is TAKE ACTION games (TAG). The video game website www.newsgaming.com greatly embodies the idea of tactical media in video games. Newsgaming coins this name as a new genre that brings awareness to current news-related issues based on true world events, as opposed to fantasy worlds that other video games are based upon. This team of game developers contributes to the emerging culture that is largely aimed at raising awareness on important matters in a new and brilliant approach.\n\nAnother examples of tactical media within video games is \"The McDonald's Game\"; the author of this game takes power away from the executive officers of McDonald's and gives it back to the public by informing then, through rhetoric, on how McDonald's does its business and what means they use to accomplish it.\n\nChris Crawford's \"Balance of the Planet\", made in 1990, is another example of tactical media, in which the game describes environmental issues.\n\nBest known for his homeless vehicle project. Wodiczko designed a sleeping quarters for the homeless using a device that resembled a shopping cart and inside was a designed sleeping area. He dispersed the vehicles to homeless people around New York City, envisioning a goal that raised homelessness awareness. New York City officials confiscated the vehicles so the message would not further spread.\n\nBest known for Couple in a Cage, performances where people pretending to be extinct natives are displayed in a caged area in public. This work of art is intended to challenge the idea of preconceptions that many hold regarding other cultures.\n\nBustamante performs art that challenges stereotypes and constructions of identity, bringing attention to issues about personal classification and character. She is a strong proponent of individualism and personal growth: the only entity capable of forging an identity being the person him or herself.\n\nKaprow's work attempts to integrate art and life. Through \"Happenings\", the separation between life, art, artist, and audience becomes vague and open to interpretation. The \"Happening\" allows the artist to experiment with human senses, deploying the involvement of sight, sound, and smell. Key elements of happenings are planned, but occasionally, artists retain room for improvisation.\n\nMandiberg produces websites and Firefox plug-ins that provide information about environmental aspects of our world, such as the cost of oil. His plug-ins reshape and modify the displayed information on other websites to display an alarming point.\n\nDe Certeau helped invent the idea and methodology that is tactical media and stressed the important roles of consumers vs. producers in society.\nGeert Lovink is a very influential person and has played a large role in the evolution and presence of tactical media. Lovink in a sense believes the idea of tactical media has been greatly miscued and that what this idea and title once stood for has been misinterpreted and drawn off course by falsified groups and causes that claim the title of tactical media.\nIn 2009, Rita Raley, Associate Professor of English at UC Santa Barbara authored a book titled \"Tactical Media\" published by the University of Minnesota Press in its \"Electronic Mediations\" series. Raley provides a critical exploration of the new media art activism that has emerged from, and in direct response to, postindustrialism and neoliberal globalization. Throughout the book Raley analyzes projects by tactical media groups such as the DoEAT group, the Critical Art Ensemble, Electronic Civil Disobedience to name a few. Raley argues that contemporary models of resistance and dissent in fact mimic the decentralized and virtual operations of global capital in our \"post-9/11 security state\" to exploit and undermine the system from within.\n\nThe Yes Men are an activist duo who perform \"identity correction\", in which they pose as representatives of large corporations and fake moral actions (in contrast to the actual ideology of such groups). Using mass media outlets, the duo draw attention to corporate crime and often create situations in which corporations must publicly acknowledge their lack of responsibility towards disastrous events.\n\nAndujar turns free and open-source software into a progressive tool to reprogram the use and understanding of computers as well as social culture at large.\n\nIt has often been compared to culture jamming, as both use many of the same techniques in an attempt to occupy the public space controlled by mass media. Where the two practices differ is in their way to obtain this public space; while culture jamming consists of a response to the dominant practices within it, tactical media uses the dominant practices in order to penetrate it and become part of it. \"Don't hate the media, become the media\" (as coined by Jello Biafra, spoken word artist and lead singer songwriter of the Dead Kennedys) is a slogan often adopted by tactical activists and reflects this important distinction. Tactical media has also been compared to alternative media. It differs from the latter by its manner in dealing with mass media where alternative media does not seek to infiltrate the dominant by a quick tactic; it attempts to oppose it by proposing what its name suggests: an alternative to the dominant.\n\nTactical media is described as the rebellious user—examples of media tacticians include hackers, street rappers, or an innocent bystander filming an incident. An important factor in tactical media is the idea of \"ground level\" work, meaning that a power struggle exists: ordinary people who do not possess status or capital utilize technology to create a temporary reversal of power. Certain aspects that strengthen the magnitude of tactical media can include crisis, criticism, critique, or absurdity—in order to convey a social message.\n\nTactical media's counterpart is strategic media: a common analogy used to describe this phenomenon is an overseer controlling the masses. They are people who are the supplier of information: examples include producers, authors, and educators. They promote ideas that typically only benefit them, whereas tactical media tends to broadcast a message that criticizes a powerful entity, such as a corporation or strong organization.\n\nThere is some debate that tactical media resembles a strategy more than a tactic.\n\nAlthough a crucial element of tactical media states that ordinary citizens of society are performing the criticism, some say that even everyday people may have skewed intentions or opinions that do not represent the societal ideals as a whole.\n\nMuch of the tactical media projects are fueled by information warfare and has also been accused to be closely linked to propaganda. The high value of aesthetics placed within a project is said to be the element that enables the transfer of this information, parallel to how propaganda functions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5634296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5634296", "title": "Teen Dance Ordinance", "text": "Teen Dance Ordinance\n\nThe Teen Dance Ordinance was a controversial Seattle law which severely curtailed the ability of concert and club promoters to hold events for underaged patrons. During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled \"draconian\") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of sexual abuse, child prostitution, and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the Universal Life Church, whose dance events were \"religious services\". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the City Council on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:\n\n\nWith these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no promoter would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing civil abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.\n\nWhile the ordinance only regulated \"dances,\" the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a \"dance.\" All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for alternative rock and the grunge scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.\n\nProponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a \"bubble of safety.\"\n\nThe repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of JAMPAC, a musicians' and promoters' political action committee founded by Krist Novoselic of Nirvana. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.\n\nThe ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.\n\nA new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor Paul Schell. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the First Amendment right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous WTO meetings of 1999) and the new mayor Greg Nickels, a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.\n\nThe new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:\n\nThe new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows. Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. Raves have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as \"concerts\" and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of MDMA by attendees have been reported.\n\nIn March 2006, in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill massacre where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, \"The Seattle Times\" editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be \"thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled.\" Local community leaders however have so-far ignored such pleas, noting that the incident was the work of a deranged gunman whose intent to kill could not be stopped with new city laws.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1585377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585377", "title": "The Soup", "text": "The Soup\n\nThe Soup is an American television series that aired weekly on E! from July 1, 2004 until December 18, 2015. The program was a revamped version of \"Talk Soup\" that focused on recaps of various popular culture and television moments of the week. The show was hosted by comedian Joel McHale, who provided sarcastic and satirical commentary on the various clips. On November 18, 2015, \"The Soup\" was cancelled by E! and its last episode aired December 18, 2015. On February 18, 2018, \"The Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale\", a spiritual successor to \"The Soup\", premiered on Netflix.\n\n\"The Soup\" started on July 1, 2004 as the \"What The...? Awards\", but the name was changed to maintain name recognition with \"Talk Soup\".\n\nOn January 9, 2013, \"The Soup\" debuted a new graphics package, including a new logo designed by Newspeak Agency.\n\nStarting June 2, 2014, \"The Soup\" began airing live episodes. Originally only to last for one month, the program has since become a live show.\n\nOn November 18, 2015 \"The Soup\" was cancelled, the number of episodes that were to be produced was later reduced by one. A decision was made not to air the episode that had been filmed and intended to air the same day as the November 2015 Paris attacks due to multiple references to \"killing Baby Hitler\". As the episode was pre-filmed, it later aired on November 27, likely replacing a clip show due to it being the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe show features the host, Joel McHale, on a green-screened set with a screen to his right. The show is broken up into various segments that focus on themes such as reality television shows or shows on E!. McHale introduces each clip, which is then played. He then comments on the clip before moving on to the next one. There is a live audience on the show, composed of a small group of E! employees, their family and friends, along with the typical production personnel. The audience is involved in the show, laughing and cheering along with the clips.\n\nAlthough the show is scripted, a large portion of it is ad-libbed.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, a blog was started for \"The Soup\" on E!'s website.\n\n\"The Soup\" has its own cast of recurring characters. They include Mankini (a man wearing a bikini top and pants played by Dominic DeLeo, who is also a writer and producer for the show), a dancing maxipad (Tess Rafferty, a supervising producer and the only female writer on \"The Soup\"), two nerds who dress as \"Star Wars\" characters, an intern named Matt whom McHale shoots with a gun (often with the shooting sound effect purposefully played out of sync, or even played with other objects or with just fingers), Jewbacca (Chewbacca's lawyer), and \"Spaghetti Cat\", a cat eating spaghetti from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\". Additionally, Tom McNamara, The Soup's stage manager and former stage manager on \"Talk Soup\", and Kelly Levy (\"née\" Andrews), the show's former announcer and a producer, have made appearances on the show, with Kelly portraying Courtney Stodden. Executive producer Edward Boyd's chihuahua Lou is used regularly in segment openings, most notably the \"Clip of the Week\", and elsewhere in the show. He also appeared with Joel at the show's intro, which showed them watching a different TV show each week, until the intro was changed in early 2010. The current intro juxtaposes brief clips introduced by announcer Anndi McAfee and a \"reaction\" by another clip, wildly out of context.\n\nThe show has a number of segments that focus on various genres of television shows. Regular segments include:\n\n\"The Soup\" has also featured other recurring segments:\n\nThe show has a number of recurring jokes and segments. One of the most frequent jokes is Joel McHale making fun of Ryan Seacrest. He usually comments on Seacrest's height, sexuality, clothing, busy work schedule, income, or demeanor.\n\nJoel has also spoofed other actors, most notably \"\" leading man David Caruso, who plays Lieutenant Horatio Caine. He usually makes fun of the character's tendency to always put on his sunglasses and say corny one-liners at the start of every episode (followed by the first 2–3 seconds of the opening sequence). Joel also will sometimes spoof a person after a clip.\n\nJoel also jokes about how self-centered Tyra Banks is on her self-titled talk show. More jokes are Joel making fun of Spencer Pratt's \"creepy flesh colored beard\" as well as the ages of Larry King and Regis Philbin and how they are still alive. Also, McHale often comically berates or abuses \"interns\" for the show, usually ending with a poorly timed (or sometimes completely out-of-place) audio clip of a gun firing after McHale uses a prop gun on them. McHale has often attempted to \"shoot\" Mankini, but with no effect.\n\nThe Spaghetti Cat from \"The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet\" has been used a number of times, usually with a model of the cat rolling in, looking at Joel, and then rolling back out.\n\nJoel has often made fun of Bruno Tonioli's flamboyancy while giving comments on \"Dancing with the Stars\" stating that he was reading excerpts from his romance novel \"Jazz Hands and Cold Feet\".\n\n\"The Soup\" makes jokes at the A&E TV Series, \"\". Whenever Joel would introduce a clip from the show, a sound clip would say \"That's Right It's Steven Seagal\", followed by Joel drinking a Steven Seagal \"energy drink\" that would humorously float into frame.\n\nDue to NFL Coach Jimmy Johnson's recent appearance on \"\", Joel usually mentions his \"Extenze-enhanced penis\", followed by a clip of Johnson saying, \"I do.\"\n\nA number of clips have been repeatedly shown on \"The Soup\". One clip features Oprah Winfrey saying \"My va-jay-jay is painin'!\" while hanging from a harness at the Miraval resort. Another clip involves Whitney Houston yelling \"Kiss My Ass!\" at her husband. McHale has mentioned that this clip is one of his favorites. Still another clip that is often shown is of \"The Today Show\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s news correspondent Ann Curry starting her report by saying, \"Good morning, good morning everybody, in the news this morning, good morning\", which Olbermann mimicked on his appearance on the July 25, 2008 show. Joel often shows a clip of Kendra Wilkinson from \"The Girls Next Door\" laughing. When someone mentions marriage on the show, they will often show a clip of Elizabeth Taylor screaming \"Marriage?! Noooooo!\" Shorter clips are sometimes used as interjections. Clips of Danny Noriega (\"I guess some people weren't likin' it!\"), and more recently, Tatiana Del Toro giggling uncontrollably, have been used as part of McHale's reactions to clips. Recent favorites include Gary Busey exclaiming \"I'm going to pull your endocrine system out of your body\", Tila Tequila yelling out \"A pig's vagina!\", Michelle Galdenzi from \"Scream Queens\" saying \"and by record, I mean vagina.\", \"Big Brother\" contestants Jase Wirey and Michelle Costa \"talking\" to one another using animal and computer sounds, respectively; \"Chicken Tetrazzini\" clip from \"Maury\", Spencer Pratt from \"The Hills\" whispering \"That's the problem\", Billy Bush saying \"It's Gross\", and Kate Gosselin squealing in a chirpy/grating-sounding voice \"Come and Getcher POPcoooooorn!\". Recently, the Jeffrey Osborne song, \"On the Wings of Love\", has been used to mock the current season of \"The Bachelor\". Vonda, a woman featured on the TruTv show \"Over the Limit\" has been featured saying, \"Dunka Doo Balls.\" This clip has become a new favorite. Recently, a clip from \"Fantasia for Real\" featuring Fantasia's Aunt Bunny saying, \"Gurl Please\", has become a new favorite. Also, a clip of \"Ma\" from TruTV's \"Ma's Roadhouse\" saying \"He's a douchebag,\" after Joel ask what she thinks of a less than favourable man, such as Mel Gibson, has come into use. Another clip of Ryan Seacrest saying, \"Hell no, say what\", has been used as reactions to clips. Calvin Tran, a contestant on Bravo's \"The Fashion Show\", has recently been featured in a clip saying, \"Oh, here go Hell Come.\" Frequently following \"Good Day New York\" clips, McHale will ask Greg Kelly to explain how something works, and this will follow with a clip of Kelly shrugging and saying, \"Science\".\n\n\"The Soup\" will often make blatant and obvious edits to clips of shows, often killing off characters (as in their versions of \"\" and \"The Hills\") or splicing McHale and other characters into the shows. McHale will often punctuate the clip by saying \"We doctored that.\" However, if a clip was shown that may have made the audience think that it was edited by \"The Soup\" for broadcast while watching it, McHale would state before hand \"We did not doctor this.\"\n\nOriginal skits are integrated into the show as responses or jokes to clips. Fake movie trailers and advertisements are created as spoofs to segments or clips. Among the movies spoofed are \"Spider-Man 3\" (in reference to McHale's appearance in \"Spider-Man 2\"), \" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \" Made of Honor\", \"Righteous Kill\", \"Mamma Mia\", \" Beverly Hills Chihuahua\", \" Quarantine\", (which McHale spoofed with QuaranTween about Disney Channel celebrities), \"Prom Night\", \"Fast & Furious\", and a Tyler Perry movie.\n\n\nIn addition to regular episodes, special \"Best of...\" episodes of \"The Soup\" have been shown under the header \"\"The Soup\" Presents\". Episodes of this nature have been produced on topics such as models and modeling shows, fights on television, and talk shows, two \"Chicks, Man/Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\" specials focusing on reality TV females, a show about love and marriage called \"Love and Other Burning Sensations\", and most recently, a show dedicated to television programs that have had recurring appearances on \"The Soup\" (the \"shows [they] just cannot quit\"). During the holiday seasons, two-part episodes showcasing the best clips of the year are aired (Clipdowns).\n\n\"The Soup\" started off as a relatively quiet show, but became one of the most popular programs on E!. By 2006 it was the third highest rated show on the network.\n\nIn July 2013, \"The Soup\" averaged 682,000 viewers, and about 56 percent of viewers watch a recorded version of the show. The 500th episode of \"The Soup\" recorded 909,000 viewers, with 653,000 of those in the 18—49 demographic.\n\nThe one-hour finale on December 18, 2015 ended with 561,000 viewers.\n\nSince E! is owned by Comcast Entertainment Group, their now-defunct sibling networks aired tailored versions for their networks, including Style, Versus and G4, all taped in the same studio and utilizing the same crew.\n\nOn August 16, 2008, Style premiered \"The Dish\", hosted by Danielle Fishel. The show focused more on celebrity, magazine, and fashion industry trends, along with style and fashion-related reality programs in more detail, including \"Project Runway\" and various shows on the shopping channels, HGTV and DIY Network. It was cancelled on March 20, 2011, two months after the merger of NBC and Comcast was complete. It was thought the cancellation was the direct result of former competitors Bravo and Oxygen coming under common NBCUniversal ownership with Style; the two networks and their programming had been among the major comedic targets of \"The Dish\".\n\nOn September 15, 2008, E! parent Comcast Entertainment Group announced another spin-off, this time sports-related, of the series, which aired on the group's sports network, Versus (now known as NBC Sports Network since 2012), called \"Sports Soup\" and was hosted by Matt Iseman. Debuted on October 14, the program once aired twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Later, production was reduced to weekly at 10 pm ET on Tuesdays (or later depending on the end of \"NHL on Versus\" or other sports coverage). It was cancelled on July 15, 2010.\n\nA third version, airing on G4, titled \"Web Soup\", hosted by Chris Hardwick debuted June 7, 2009 at 9 pm ET. This version is more of a blend of the commentary and reaction portions of \"The Soup\" and two other G4 programs; \"Whacked Out Videos\" and the \"Around the Net\" viral video segment which opens \"Attack of the Show\". This show ended after its 3rd season on July 20, 2011.\n\n\"Celebrity Soup\" was the British version of the American show hosted by comedian Iain Lee. Unlike \"The Soup\", \"Celebrity Soup\" airs 19 episodes in a season, instead of year-round like in the United States. It had some of the same features as the original (i.e. \"Chat Stew\"), but also has its own running gags and features. The series had a similar set, with a window overlooking London's Big Ben instead of Hollywood, as in the U.S. original.\n\n\"The Soup Investigates\" was a spin-off of The Soup. It features most of the same crew, including Joel McHale as the host. In the spin-off, the reporters go looking for potentially funny celebrity news stories. It is a spoof of investigative journalism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "370701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370701", "title": "Tie-in", "text": "Tie-in\n\nA tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.\n\nCommon tie-in products include literary works, which may be novelizations of a media property, original novels or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of blockbuster film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.\n\nTie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such or \"making-of\" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as soundtrack recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.\n\nA novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.\n\nTie-in novels are often newly published editions of a novel on which a film was based, sometimes renamed to match the film's title and using promotional art created for the film. For example, when Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" was adapted into the 1988 film \"Die Hard\", the novel was republished as a paperback tie-in under the \"Die Hard\" title with the film's poster on the cover.\n\nIf a film is based on a story shorter than a novel — such as a short story, novelette, or novella — a tie-in book may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. For example, when Stephen King's novella \"Apt Pupil\" was adapted to film, the book originally featuring the story — \"Different Seasons\" — was republished as \"Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons\". Similarly, tie-in novels were published to promote the films \"Minority Report\" and \"Paycheck\", featuring the original \"Minority Report\" and \"Paycheck\" short stories, both written by Philip K. Dick.\n\nTie-in novels may also continue the story told in the original property, such as the many novels published as part of the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe set before or after the events of the original \"Star Wars\" film trilogy. In 2015, the \"New York Times\" noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a \"patina of respectability\" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.\n\nSome video games are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.\n\nVideo game movie tie-ins are expensive for a game developer to license, and the game designers have to work within constraints imposed by the film studio, under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release. The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.\n\nMovie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality. For example, \"Amiga Power\" awarding Psygnosis's three movie licenses (\"Dracula\", \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Last Action Hero\", all reviewed in June 1994) 36% \"in total\"; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with \"The Blues Brothers\" being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash. Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date, or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the games based on the last two films of the \"Harry Potter\" film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.\n\nVideo tie-in licences for novels tend to be adventure games. \"The Hobbit (1982)\" and \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" are text adventures, whilst \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (1995) is a point-and-click adventure and \"Neuromancer\" (1988) is a graphic adventure. Action games based on novels are less common (\"William Shatner's TekWar\" (1995), a first-person shooter). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.\n\nTie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.\n\nThe lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted. For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property. In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel. In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.\n\nThese tie-ins can be considered as forms of \"free advertising\", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.\n\nSome early examples of TV tie-in books are \"Leave It to Beaver\" (1960), \"Here's Beaver!\" (1961), and \"Beaver and Wally\" (1961) by Beverly Cleary and \"Star Trek\" (1967) by James Blish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8816881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8816881", "title": "Topit", "text": "Topit\n\nA Topit is a utility device used by magicians to dispose of objects secretly. It plays a similar role in the magician's toolkit to pulls, holdouts, servantes, and techniques such as sleeving or lapping. While the original Topit booklet by Patrick Page was put out by Lewis Davenport Ltd. in London decades ago, it was Michael Ammar who popularized the Topit with his refinement of Topit technique and inspired a number of well-known close-up magicians to adopt it.\nTopits were employed by pickpockets and thieves during the 19th century. This primitive form of the topit was called the \"Poacher's Pouch\".\nThe art of Topit has developed, like some other forms of magic, in symbiotic relationship between magicians and grifters, both considered sleight of hand artists.\n"}
{"id": "27125106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27125106", "title": "Transportation theory (psychology)", "text": "Transportation theory (psychology)\n\nNarrative transportation theory proposes that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. The mental state of narrative transportation can explain the persuasive effect of stories on people, who may experience narrative transportation when certain contextual and personal preconditions are met, as Green and Brock postulate for the transportation-imagery model. As van Laer, de Ruyter, Visconti, and Wetzels elaborate further, narrative transportation occurs whenever the story receiver experiences a feeling of entering a world evoked by the narrative because of empathy for the story characters and imagination of the story plot.\n\nDeighton, Romer, and McQueen anticipate the construct of narrative transportation by arguing that a story invites story receivers into the action it portrays and, as a result, makes them lose themselves in the story. Gerrig was the first to coin the notion of narrative transportation within the context of novels. Using travel as a metaphor for reading, he conceptualizes narrative transportation as a state of detachment from the world of origin that the story receiver—in his words, the traveler—experiences because of his or her engrossment in the story, a condition that Green and Brock later describe as the story receiver's experience of being carried away by the story. Notably, the state of narrative transportation makes the world of origin partially inaccessible to the story receiver, thus marking a clear separation in terms of here/there and now/before, or narrative world/world of origin.\n\nMost research on narrative transportation follows the original definition of the construct. Scholars in the field constantly reaffirm the relevance of three features. \nIn accordance with these features, van Laer et al. define narrative transportation as the extent to which \nwhich leads him or her to experience suspended reality during story reception.\n\nNarrative transportation is a form of experiential response to narratives and thus is similar to other constructs, such as absorption, optimal experience or flow, and immersion. Yet several subtle, critical differences exist. Absorption refers to a personality trait or general tendency to be immersed in life experiences; transportation is an engrossing temporary experience. Flow is a more general construct (i.e., people can experience flow in a variety of activities), whereas transportation specifically entails empathy and mental imagery, which do not occur in flow experiences. Phillips and McQuarrie demonstrate that immersion is primarily an experiential response to aesthetic and visual elements of images, whereas narrative transportation relies on a story with plot and characters, features that are not present in immersion.\n\nSince narrative transportation's conceptualization, research has demonstrated that the transported \"traveler\" can return changed by the journey. Subsequent studies have confirmed that a story can engross the story receiver in a transformational experience, whose effects are strong and long-lasting. The transformation that narrative transportation achieves is persuasion of the story receiver. More specifically, van Laer et al.'s literature review reveals that narrative transportation can cause affective and cognitive responses, beliefs, and attitude and intention changes. However, the processing pattern of narrative transportation is markedly different from that in well-established models of persuasion.\n\nBefore 2000, dual-process models of persuasion, especially the elaboration likelihood model and heuristic-systematic model, dominated persuasion research. These models attempt to explain why people accept or reject message claims. According to these models, the determination of a claim's acceptability can result from careful evaluation of the arguments presented or from reliance on superficial cues, such as the presence of an expert. Whether receivers scrutinize a message depends on the extent to which they are able and motivated to process it systematically. As important variables, these models include empathy, familiarity, involvement, and the number and nature of thoughts the message evokes. If these variables are mainly positive, the receiver's attitudes and intentions tend to be more positive; if the variables are predominantly negative, the resulting attitudes and intentions are more negative. These variables also exist in narrative persuasion.\n\nAnalytical persuasion and narrative persuasion differ depending on the role of involvement. In analytical persuasion, involvement depends on the extent to which the message has personally relevant consequences for a receiver's money, time, or other resources. If these consequences are sufficiently severe, receivers evaluate the arguments carefully and generate thoughts related to the arguments. Yet, as Slater notes, even though severe consequences for stories are relatively rare, \"viewers or readers of an entertainment narrative typically appear to be far more engrossed in the message.\" This type of involvement, or narrative transportation, is arguably the crucial determinant of narrative persuasion.\n\nThough the dual-process models provide a valid description of analytical persuasion, they do not encompass narrative persuasion. Analytical persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing messages that are overtly persuasive, such as most lessons in science books, news reports, and speeches. However, narrative persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing narrative messages that are not overtly persuasive, such as novels, movies, or video games. Addressing the strength and duration of the persuasive effects of processing stories, narrative transportation is a mental state that produces enduring persuasive effects without careful evaluation of arguments. Transported story receivers are engrossed in a story in a way that neither is inherently critical nor involves great scrutiny.\n\nNarrative transportation seems to be more unintentionally affective than intentionally cognitive in nature. This way of processing leads to potentially increasing and long-lasting persuasive effects. Appel and Richter use the term \"sleeper effect\" to describe this paradoxical property of narrative transportation over time, which consists of a more pronounced change in attitudes and intentions and a greater certainty that these attitudes and intentions are correct.\n\nPlausible explanations for the sleeper effect are twofold. \nFollowing this line of reasoning, van Laer et al. define narrative persuasion as\nThe conceptual distinction between analytical persuasion and narrative persuasion and the theoretical framework of sound interpretation of narrative persuasion both ground the extended transportation-imagery model (ETIM).\n\nETIM contains three methodological factors that moderate the overall effect of narrative transportation, as van Laer, Feiereisen, and Visconti detail. The narrative transportation effect is stronger\n\n"}
