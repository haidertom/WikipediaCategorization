It usually refers to sung praise in Second Temple period Jewish materials.\n\nSongs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is the principal source for angelic tongues at Qumran. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:\n\nIt is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.\n\nThe pseudepigraphical Testament of Job (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a Therapeutae community. Job gives one of his daughters \"a cord\" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) \nJob’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). \n\nThere is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in Alexandria by Philo, but no mention there of angelic tongues.\n\nA possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 \"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.\" The distinction \"of men\" and \"of angels\" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 \"There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning\" may imply that \"tongues of men\" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.\" refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the \"angelic\" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that \"It is evident then that Paul thinks of glossolalia as language\". \n"}

This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving critiques of their own work and by mentoring the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services.\n\nUnlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very participatory. Most conferences are divided into presentations, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more presenters and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work.\n\nAn authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop.\n\nOne popular series of authors' conferences is the Pattern Languages of Programming conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of software design patterns and pattern languages.\n\nThe shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process.\n\nThe writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6–10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments.\n\n\n"}

Also known as barrel connectors, concentric barrel connectors or tip connectors, these small cylindrical connectors come in an enormous variety of sizes.\n\nBarrel plug connectors are commonly used to interface the secondary side of a power supply with the device. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed switch; the switch can disconnect internal batteries whenever the external power supply is connected.\n\nThe connector pairs for barrel connectors are defined in terms of 'plugs' and 'receptacles'; receptacles are more commonly called 'sockets' or 'jacks' (US). Receptacles may be panel-mounted or circuit board-mounted. Plugs are on cables. Some 'in-line' receptacles are also cable-mounted.\n\nThere is a long history in electrical engineering of referring to such power plugs\"—that is to say, plugs with holes instead of prongs—\"as female, particularly regarding coaxial transmission of electricity. Type N connectors, and all EC 60320#Appliance couplers IEC 60320 \"appliance coupler\" plugs are examples of this. That said, while IEC 60320 provides gender-based standards for higher-voltage plugs (such as the cable plugged into a standard computer power supply), they have not yet defined gender-based standards for low-voltage coaxial power connectors such as those discussed herein; I.E., which component is \"male\" and which \"female.\" As a result, there are varying opinions in this regard. Many industrial suppliers avoid gender terminology but many do not. Similarly, some people view the corded plug as female and some perceive it as male. Some, after consideration and surveys, found that user perception of which was male and which female was evenly split.\n\nPower is generally supplied \"by\" a plug \"to\" a receptacle. Cables are available with one in-line receptacle fanning out to a number of plugs, so that many devices may be supplied by one supply. As the use of a plug implies a cable, even a short stub, some power supplies carry panel-mounted receptacles instead to avoid this cable, i.e. the normal convention of power from plug to receptacle is reversed. Cables for such cases are available with a plug at each end, although cables or adapters with two \"receptacles\" are not widely available.\n\nOn the female plug, the outer body is metallic and cylindrical in shape, and comprises one of the two contacts. The second, inside contact is a hollow metallic cylinder constructed to accept insertion of the pin in the corresponding male connector. The inner and outer barrels are separated by an insulating layer. The outer contact is generally called the barrel, sleeve or ring, and the inner contact is called the tip.\n\nThere is typically a single spring-loaded contact at the side of the male connector and a pin in the center corresponding to the intended female plug.\n\nThere are many different sizes of coaxial power connectors (see table at end of this article).\n\nContact ratings commonly vary from unspecified up to 5 amperes (11 amperes for special high-power versions). Voltage is often unspecified, but may be up to 48V with 12V typical. The smaller types usually have lower current and voltage ratings.\n\nIt is quite possible that new sizes will continue to appear and disappear. One possible reason that a particular manufacturer may use a new size is to discourage use of third-party power supplies, either for technical reasons or to force use of their own accessories, or both.\n\nThe sizes and shapes of connectors do not consistently correspond to the same power specifications across manufacturers and models. Two connectors from different manufacturers with different sizes could potentially be attached to power supplies with the same voltage and current. Alternatively, connectors of the same size can be part of power supplies with different voltages and currents. Use of the wrong power supply may cause severe equipment damage, or even fire.\n\nGeneric plugs are often described by their inside diameter, such as \"2.1mm DC plugs\" and \"2.5mm DC (direct current) plugs\".\n\nAfter the two common 5.5mm OD (outer diameter) plugs, the next-most common size is 3.5mm OD with a 1.3mm ID (inner diameter), usually about 9.5mm in length, although both longer and shorter versions also exist. These 3.5mm OD plugs are normally used for lower voltages and currents.\n\nA ring-shaped 'locking detent' or 'high-retention feature', present on the barrel of some DC coaxial connectors, is a feature intended to prevent accidental disconnection. Typically, this feature is a conical cut-back section of the tip, just behind the insulator that separates the inner from outer contact surfaces.\n\nA 'lock-ring DC coaxial connector' uses a captive threaded ring or collar to secure the connection between the plug and jack. This design offers strong resistance to unplugging when used properly.\nA 'lock-tab DC coaxial connector' (also called 'bayonet lock') offers a compromise that resists unplugging, but which will disengage when pulled hard enough. This connector uses small metal tab protrusions on the connector barrel to lock the plug in place, requiring a special push-and-rotate motion to engage the locks.\n\nThere are several standards in existence, such as IEC, EIAJ in Japan and DIN in Germany. More recently, some manufacturers appear to have implemented their own system correlating voltage and plug size. In addition, there appears to be a trend to standardize DC connector to negative barrel (or sleeve) of a coaxial power connector.\n\nIEC 60130-10:1971 defines five DC power connectors.\n\n\nFive plug and matching socket or jack designs are defined by the EIAJ standard RC-5320A (also called JEITA RC-5320A). Each of these plugs is used with a specified voltage range. Most manufacturers use a yellow insulating material to distinguish these plugs from other similar-looking DC plugs.\n\n\nEIAJ-04 and 05 have an internal male pin in the plug. The 01 through 03 sizes do not and are similar to the generic plugs in structure. These five EIAJ plugs are 9.5 mm in length and have a current rating of 2A.\n\nThere are two other, less common, connectors defined by EIAJ; RC-5321 and RC-5322. The latter is designed for both 12 V and 24 V automotive applications.\n\nThe German national standards organization DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung—German Institute for Standardization) issued DIN 45323, which defines two DC power plug and jack (respectively) sizes. At least one of these sizes has a maximum rating of 34 V and 3 A. The information here is inferred from catalog references, as the German standard has not been translated into English yet.\n\n\nThis list attempts to show all known sizes, and is annotated with some manufacturers producing selected types, since each manufacturer makes its own unique subset of the known types. Note that the example part numbers given may have different connector barrel (sleeve) lengths, and are not necessarily exact equivalents. There are many more design variants than can be listed in this table, so only a small sampling of part numbers is given.\n\nConnector size is often listed in the format OD (outer diameter) x ID (inner diameter) x L (length of barrel) and expressed in millimeters. Designations may vary between manufacturers.\n\nCoaxial plugs that have a male center pin will have another measurement, Center Pin Diameter (CPD). These plugs are often used for higher power applications such as portable computers.\n\nThere are a number of sizes listed below that appear to be quite similar, and while the tolerances of these connectors are typically indicated as ±0.05 or ±0.03 mm by the manufacturers, there is still ambiguity as to whether two sizes differing by only 0.05 mm (or where the specification is only given to the nearest 0.10 mm) warrants listing them separately here.\nRadioShack sold a line of adapter plugs for universal AC adapters. Each \"Adaptaplug\" had a single-letter code, but did not provide any other official designation, nor did RadioShack publish the complete specifications and tolerances on barrel and pin dimensions. RadioShack's web site listed the diameters to the nearest 0.1 mm, and sometimes differs slightly from the official EIAJ RC-5320A standard dimensions. This list may include some parts RadioShack has discontinued but are retained here for completeness.\n\n\n"}

Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at Bell Labs, all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.\n\nHarry Nyquist's 1924 paper, \"Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed\", contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.\n\nRalph Hartley's 1928 paper, \"Transmission of Information,\" uses the word \"information\" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the hartley in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.\n\nAlan Turing in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war Enigma ciphers.\n\nThe main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by Claude Shannon in the \"Bell System Technical Journal\" in July and October 1948 under the title \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\". Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He used also tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.\n\nIn 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography (\"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.\n\nIn 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics with his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.\n\nThe studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, Warren Weaver and others, prompted research on new models of communication from other scientific perspectives like psychology and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.\n\nScholars from disciplines different from mathematics and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':\n\nBasic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term is used in the field of software internationalization, where each grapheme is a character.\n\nScripts which require CTL for proper display may be known as complex scripts. Examples include the Arabic alphabet and scripts of the Brahmic family, such as Devanagari or the Thai alphabet. Many scripts do not require CTL. For instance, the Latin alphabet or Chinese characters can be typeset by simply displaying each character one after another in straight rows or columns. However, even these scripts have alternate forms or optional features (such as cursive writing) which require CTL to produce on computers.\n\nThe main characteristics of CTL complexity are:\n\nNot all occurrences of these characteristics require CTL. For example, the Greek alphabet has context-sensitive shaping of the letter sigma, which appears as ς at the end of a word and σ elsewhere. However, these two forms are normally stored as different characters; for instance, Unicode has both and , and does not treat them as equivalent. For collation and comparison purposes, software should consider the string \"δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς\" equivalent to \"δῖοσ Ἀχιλλεύσ\", but for typesetting purposes they are distinct and CTL is not required to choose the correct form.\n\nMost text-rendering software that is capable of CTL will include information about specific scripts, and so will be able to render them correctly without font files needing to supply instructions on how to lay out characters. Such software is usually provided in a library; examples include:\n\nHowever, such software is unable to properly render any script for which it lacks instructions, which can include many minority scripts. The alternative approach is to include the rendering instructions in the font file itself. Rendering software still needs to be capable of reading and following the instructions, but this is relatively simple.\n\nExamples of this latter approach include Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) and Graphite. Both of these names encompass both the instruction format and the software supporting it; AAT is included on Apple operating systems, while Graphite is available for Microsoft Windows and Linux-based systems.\n\nThe OpenType format is primarily intended for systems using the first approach (layout knowledge in the renderer, not the font), but it has a few features that assist with CTL, such as contextual ligatures. AAT and Graphite instructions can be embedded in OpenType font files.\n\n\n"}

The main factors in determining if someone is a compulsive talker are talking in a continuous manner or stopping only when the other person starts talking, and others perceiving their talking as a problem. Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness, willingness to communicate, self-perceived communication competence, and neuroticism. Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, are unable to stop, or do not see it as a problem.\n\nIt has been suggested, through research done by Dr. James C. McCroskey and Dr. Virginia P. Richmond, that United States society finds talkativeness attractive. It is something which is rewarded and positively correlated with leadership and influence. However, those who compulsively talk are not to be confused with those who are simply highly verbal and vary their quantity of talk. Compulsive talkers are those who are highly verbal in a manner that varies greatly from the norm and is not in the person’s best interest. Those who have been characterized as compulsive talkers talk with a greater frequency, dominate conversations, and are less inhibited than others. They have also been found to be more argumentative and have a positive attitude regarding communication. Tendencies towards compulsive talking also are more frequently seen in the personality structure of neurotic psychotic extraverts. It has also been found that talkaholics are never behaviorally shy.\n\nIn 1993 James C. McCroskey and Virginia P. Richmond constructed the Talkaholic Scale, a Likert-type model, to help identify those who are compulsive talkers. A score of 40 or above, which indicates two standard deviations above the norm, would signal someone to be a true talkaholic.\n\nA study done in 1995 of 811 university students in the United States found 5.2% of that population had results indicating they were talkaholics. A similar study from the same year with students from New Zealand found similar results, with 4.7% scoring above 40.\n\nCompulsive talking can drive people away, which in turn can leave that person with no social support. Interrupting, another act that is associated with talkaholics, can signal to other people a lack of respect.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Wagele, an author of best-selling books on personality types, there are different ways to handle compulsive talkers. Such coping techniques include changing the focus of the conversation, taking attention away from the talkaholic, leaving the conversation, and creating a distraction.\n\n\nBooks\n\nAcademic articles\n\n"}
{"id": "1745389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1745389", "title": "Cooperative principle", "text": "Cooperative principle\n\nIn social science generally and linguistics specifically, the cooperative principle describes how effective communication in conversation is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by Paul Grice, who introduced it, \"Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\" Though phrased as a prescriptive command, the principle is intended as a description of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as \"encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation\".\n\nThe cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication. Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the pragmatics of natural language. Applying the Gricean maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to this maxim, Grice writes, \"Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work.\"\n\n\n\nThese maxims may also be understood as describing the assumptions listeners normally make about the way speakers will talk, rather than prescriptions for how one ought to talk. Philosopher Kent Bach writes:\n\n...[W]e need first to get clear on the character of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, presumptions that we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).\n\nGricean maxims generate implicatures. If the overt, surface meaning of a sentence does not seem to be consistent with the Gricean maxims, and yet the circumstances lead us to think that the speaker is nonetheless obeying the cooperative principle, we tend to look for other meanings that could be implied by the sentence.\n\nGrice did not, however, assume that all people should constantly follow these maxims. Instead, he found it interesting when these were not respected, namely either \"flouted\" (with the listener being expected to be able to understand the message) or \"violated\" (with the listener being expected to not note this). Flouting would imply some other, hidden meaning. The importance was in what was \"not\" said. For example, answering \"It's raining\" to someone who has suggested playing a game of tennis only disrespects the maxim of relation on the surface; the reasoning behind this \"fragment\" sentence is normally clear to the interlocutor (the maxim is just \"flouted\").\n\nIt is possible to flout a maxim and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken. Many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with sarcasm or irony. One can flout the maxim of quality to tell a clumsy friend who has just taken a bad fall that her gracefulness is impressive and obviously intend to mean the complete opposite. Likewise, flouting the maxim of quantity may result in ironic understatement, the maxim of relevance in blame by irrelevant praise, and the maxim of manner in ironic ambiguity. The Gricean maxims are therefore often purposefully flouted by comedians and writers, who may hide the complete truth and manipulate their words for the effect of the story and the sake of the reader's experience.\n\nGrice's theory is often disputed by arguing that cooperative conversation, like most social behaviour, is culturally determined, and therefore the Gricean maxims and the cooperative principle cannot be universally applied due to intercultural differences. Keenan claims that the Malagasy, for example, follow a completely opposite cooperative principle in order to achieve conversational cooperation. In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige. However, Harnish points out that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. \n\nAnother criticism is that the Gricean maxims can easily be misinterpreted to be a guideline for etiquette, instructing speakers on how to be moral, polite conversationalists. However, the Gricean maxims, despite their wording, are only meant to describe the commonly accepted traits of successful cooperative communication. Geoffrey Leech introduced the politeness maxims: tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy.\n\n\n\n"}

In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts, yet are considered harder to score, attributed to the influence of the interlocutors.\n\nA discourse-completion task consists of scripted dialogue representing various scenarios, preceded by a short prompt describing the setting and situation. The prompt usually includes information on social distance between participants and pre-event background to help the participant construct the scenarios.\n\nLevenston, E. (1975).

{"id": "40717444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40717444", "title": "Dora Sakayan", "text": "Dora Sakayan\n\nDora Sakayan (classical Armenian orthography: ; reformed: ; born January 24, 1931), Professor of German Studies (retired), McGill University. Specializing initially as a Germanist, today she is known for her work in various areas of Applied Linguistics. Sakayan is also noted for pioneering Armenology in Canada, and introducing the two branches of the Armenian language, Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, to the English-speaking world.\n\nSakayan was born in 1931 in Salonica, Greece, to Armenian parents who had escaped the Armenian Genocide. She grew up in a multilingual environment, with her first languages being Western Armenian and Modern Greek, and she received early exposure to German, French and Turkish. After immigrating to Soviet Armenia, she received her education in Eastern Armenian and Russian. Later on, she mastered English and learned other languages.\n\nSakayan received her elementary education at the Armenian Gulabi Gulbenkian School in Salonica. She then attended the local German high school Deutsche Schule Saloniki. She was 11 years old when her family moved to Vienna, Austria, where she pursued her high school education at the Gymnasium for girls in the 7th District of Vienna \"Oberschule für Mädchen, Wien VII.\"\n\nIn 1946, Sakayan’s family repatriated to Soviet Armenia where she completed her secondary education. In 1948, she was admitted to the Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages (YSPL) where she graduated with a diploma in Germanic linguistics and in Pedagogy in 1952. She was then appointed as an instructor of German at YSPL, where she taught from 1952 to 1956. Subsequently, she was invited to teach in the Department of Romance and Germanic Philology at Yerevan State University (YSU, 1956–1958).\n\nSakayan began her graduate studies in Germanic philology in 1958 at the Lomonosov Moscow State University (LMSU), completing them in 1961. Over the following four years, she shared her time between Moscow and Yerevan to pursue her teaching duties in Germanic Philology at YSU and complete her PhD thesis while raising her two young children. She obtained her PhD in Germanic Philology from Moscow Lomonosov University in 1965.\n\nIn 1965, Sakayan became Head of the Department of Foreign languages of YSU, a position she held for ten years. At the same time, she delivered lectures in the Department of Romance-Germanic Philology of YSU.\n\nSakayan immigrated to Canada in January 1975 and began to teach German at two universities: McGill University, (Department of German Studies) and the Université de Montréal (Department of Études des langues anciennes et modernes). In 1977, she was offered a full-time position at McGill and left Université de Montréal. Due to her high ratings as an instructor of German at McGill, in 1978 she was offered a joint appointment with the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies where she taught for ten years. Over the years, Sakayan rose to the rank of Full Professor at McGill University.\n\nIn 1981, Sakayan began her groundbreaking work in Armenian Studies at McGill. At the Centre of Continuing Education, she founded and supervised a program of credited Armenian courses anchored in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies. She edited and prepared for publication a number of Armenological manuscripts of linguistic, literary and historic interest, translated several books and articles from Armenian into other languages and vice versa, and made book tours. She became a regular participant at international Armenological conferences and congresses, and she also organized Armenological conferences in Canada and Armenia. Seeing her mission as presenting Armenian language and culture to non-Armenians, she founded the series \"Armenian Studies for the English Speaking World\" and published a number of scholarly books and articles under this heading. To promote the publication of her Armenological books, in 1997 she founded a small press under the name AROD Books in Montreal.\n\nAfter 25 years of service at McGill University, Sakayan retired from the Department of German Studies in 2000 and dedicated herself fully to Armenian Studies. She renewed her ties with Yerevan State University, where she regularly spends a few months every year, participating in scholarly projects, organizing international linguistic conferences, publishing her books with YSU Press and organizing book launches at YSU and elsewhere in Armenia. Among many activities in her homeland, she is the supervisor and participant of an ongoing translation project that she carries out with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU.\n\nAt the same time, Sakayan continues the promotion of Armenian Studies in Canada. In 2005, she founded an Armenian language program at the Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Montreal, carrying on a tradition that she established more than three decades ago (in 1981) at the Centre of Continuing Education at McGill University.\n\nAs a Germanist and educator in the East European tradition, Sakayan has received training in Germanic linguistics and language pedagogy. This background has led her to applied linguistics, and from the great variety of its interdisciplinary branches Sakayan has concentrated on the following areas: a) contrastive linguistics, b) foreign language acquisition, c) translation studies.\n\nSakayan includes into the contrastive discussion, besides German, other Indo-European languages: Russian, English, French, and Modern Greek. As an innovation, she also includes Armenian, a non-European language whose agglutinative properties set it apart from other languages in the Indo-European family. In fact, in Sakayan’s work, contrastive analysis is predominantly based on Armenian, and other languages are viewed through the prism of this language. The objectives of such an endeavor are to establish language typologies and to identify areas of difficulty in foreign language acquisition. Her work also incorporates the findings of Armenian and Russian data — not always accessible to Western linguists.\n\nSakayan introduces to the Western reader the idiosyncrasies of Eastern Armenian morphology and syntax, with a special focus on the verb system and its rich paradigm of non-finite verb forms, called \"derbays\" (դերբայ = participle). Over the years, she has dealt extensively with East Armenian deverbal nominalizations, deriving from certain \"derbays\": the Armenian infinitive and three participles: the present, past and the future participle. Within the framework of \"Nominalizations of various degrees\" Sakayan discusses the regular relative clause (RC), the ‘relative participles’ (RP based on the present, past and the future participle), as well and other phenomena of relativization in Eastern Armenian.\n\nSakayan contrasts Armenian clausal nominalizations with their semantic counterparts in a selective number of European languages. A noteworthy monograph in this respect is \"Formen der Textkohärenz: Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen\". This book explores East Armenian clausal nominalizations that are based on the Armenian infinitive. Sakayan describes the transformation process of finite clauses into economical nominal phrases, gives the morphosyntactic characteristics of these nominalizations, identifies the functions of the agglutinative segments in a synthetic nominalized infinitive (SNI).\n\nSakayan has also taken a keen interest in contrastive phraseology in the general sense of the term. Recognizing the importance of ready-made expressions in human communication, she has based her research on self-collected linguistic corpora of phraseological units, such as proverbs and sayings, idiomatic expressions, and routine formulae (gambits).\n\nSakayan has explored the reproduction of routine formulae (gambits) and their role for turn-taking in conversation and for organizing discourse She has created thematically and pragmatically grouped bilingual concordances of routine formulae (gambits) for language learning. See the use of such concordances in Sakayan’s textbooks.\n\nSakayan's interest in proverbs resulted in a major paremiological study accompanied by a bilingual (Armenian-English), thematically arranged anthology of 2,500 proverbs. An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure, as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs).\n\nContrastive paremiology being an ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian connections and discussions on cross-cultural translatability. In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared with a new introduction that provides an in-depth analysis of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre and can be found only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.\n\nSakayan’s scholarly interest in foreign language acquisition is apparent not only in the titles of her published articles, but also in the list of authored and co-authored textbooks, instructional manuals and methodological guides, for the instruction of both German and Armenian as foreign languages Some of these projects demonstrate the benefits of applying the latest trends in linguistics to instructional development.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, while chairing the Department of Foreign Languages at Yerevan State University (YSU) in Soviet Armenia, Sakayan authored and co-authored several textbooks, manuals and methodological guides for the instruction of German in Armenian high schools and universities. However, in accordance with Soviet censorship rules that deprived expatriate authors of authorship, the production of all books carrying her name had to be discontinued after Sakayan’s departure to Canada in 1975.\n\nAfter resettling in Canada, Sakayan continued her research in Foreign Language Methodology. In close collaboration with Professor Christine Tessier of Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada, Sakayan conducted the research project dedicated to German Stereotyped Speech Forms in Mini-Dialogues. Sakayan and Tessier laid the groundwork for a new method of communicative exercises that has received widespread recognition in the area of DaF (Deutsch als Fremdsprache, or German as a Foreign Language). The project resulted in a book called Rede und Antwort, widely used as a supplement to other DaF textbooks at universities; in 1991 it was declared in the AOL-Reference Manual as \"a hit textbook for DaF.\"\n\nThe innovative method is based on the introduction of German Stereotyped Speech Forms, or gambits, known for their important role in languages while turn-taking in interaction. Gambits used at the beginning of an utterance are seen as cues that signal not only the illocutionary feature of an utterance, but also its syntactic-semantic unfolding. The method broadly applies speech act theory and text linguistics, as well as some insights of \"grammar of expectancy,\" to the teaching of DaF. The Rede und Antwort exercises have proven to be an effective means for promoting oral skills in the classroom, which are readily applicable in real life-settings.\n\nInspired by the success of the Rede und Antwort, in the 1990s Sakayan launched and carried out a completely new project: an introductory university textbook for Western Armenian (Western Armenian for the English-speaking World: A Contrastive Approach). The textbook, which first appeared in 2000, draws on more recent achievements of linguistics in the instruction of Western Armenian. It demonstrates the great potential that contrastive linguistics has for the advancement of foreign language teaching by outlining Armenian-English contrasts throughout the course. It also applies the insights of text linguistics and grammar of expectancy by enhancing the production of correct grammatical forms anticipated by the reproduction of certain ready-made routine formulae. The textbook is conceptualized pragmatically, enabling students to carry out speech acts fundamental for communication. Although grammar receives proper attention, other linguistic aspects such as word formation, semantic vocabulary groups, pronunciation, orthography, etc. are also treated on a regular basis. The textbook was received positively and was adopted by Armenian Studies Programs at universities and schools worldwide.\n\nIn 2007, Sakayan published a new Armenian textbook, this time on Eastern Armenian, also accompanied by a CD-Rom featuring Eastern Armenian native speakers. To bring the level of the existing Western Armenian textbook to that of its Eastern Armenian counterpart, in 2012 Sakayan published a second and revised edition (with CD-Rom).\n\nBoth titles are now published by YSU Press. They are consistent in methodology and structure, with a vast amount of linguistic material proportionally distributed among 12 Units, which each consist of 12 sections. These twin Armenian textbooks are considered to be the highlight of Sakayan’s career, reflecting a lifetime of pedagogical and scholarly experience in foreign language teaching and research in applied linguistics.\n\nSakayan is also a major contributor to the study of the Armenian Genocide. In 1993, she came across the journal of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Garabed Hatcherian, and has since dedicated herself to its publication and dissemination. The journal is a chronicle of the Smyrna catastrophe of 1922, which describes how the ancient port city in Asia Minor was destroyed by a massive fire, whereby the entire Christian population was either massacred or forced to flee. The journal is also a detailed account of the hardship Dr. Hatcherian and his family of eight endured in September 1922. Dr. Hatcherian’s diary is considered to be the most widely translated book about the Armenian Genocide. So far, the journal has appeared in nine languages, three of which were translated by Sakayan, who is also the general editor of all editions. All volumes include a detailed biography of the author, a literary analysis of the journal in an expanded introduction, 52 annotations of an historical and cultural nature, an afterword, and a bibliography. The meticulous editorial work has made \"An Armenian Doctor in Turkey\" a book that has received a highly favorable international reception Sakayan is also the editor-in-chief of an important book documenting the Armenian Genocide: the newest edition of Theodik’s (Theodoros Lapchindjian) book \"Memorial to April 11\" (Armenian: Յուշարձան ապրիլ 11-ի- Hushartsan Abril 11-i), which was created with the assistance of renowned journalist and human-rights activist and publisher Ragip Zarakolu (Istanbul: Belge Publishers) and appeared in 2010. This book was first compiled and published in Turkish by Theodik in 1919 in Istanbul to pay tribute to the murdered intellectuals and community leaders of 1915—writers, journalists, editors, clergymen, academics, teachers, and jurists.\n\nThis latest edition of Theodik’s Hushartsan, published in commemoration of the 95th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, is a bilingual production (Armenian and Turkish) with a trilingual introductory section (Armenian, Turkish, and English) dedicated to the memory of Hrant Dink, the Armenian journalist who was murdered in Istanbul in 2007. Also included in this volume is an Armenian and Turkish index of the names of the 761 Armenian martyrs of April 11 (April 24 according to the Gregorian calendar).\nOver the last decade, Sakayan has been working on a translation project with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU. This project has yielded six books that Sakayan and Makaryan translated from German into Armenian and published with YSU Press. The translations are predominantly eyewitness testimonies of the Armenian Genocide that Sakayan has collected from libraries in German-speaking countries.\n\nSakayan's latest (and most important) work is a book entitled «Man treibt sie in die Wüste»; Clara und Fritz Sigrist-Hilty als Augenzeugen des Völkermordes an den Armeniern 1915–1918 [\"They drive them into the desert\": Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty as eyewitnesses of the Armenian Genocide 1915-1918] on the writings of Clara Sigrist-Hilty (1884–1988). One day after their church wedding in April 1915, the civil engineer Fritz Sigrist and the nurse Clara Hilty take the train from Werdenberg (Switzerland) and travel through the war zone to South-Eastern Turkey, where Fritz has been working at the construction of the Baghdad railway since 1910. They settle in Keller (today’s Fevzipaşa), a little town on the flank of the Amanus mountains. Shortly after their arrival, the Armenian deportations start and thousands of Armenians walk past their window. For three years the couple has to witness «the lapsing of human lights down there in the steep gorge» while they live their everyday life in their little house on the remote hillside. A visit to Aleppo makes them realize that what they were seeing in Keller on a daily basis was nothing but premeditated death marches. Things deteriorate when the skilled Armenian workers at the Baghdad railway construction site must also join those death marches. Clara feels obliged to record the atrocities, first in her journal, and later in a special eyewitness account. Fritz in his turn writes some important essays on the subject.\n\nSakayan has deciphered and transcribed the documents written in Gothic handwriting; she has meticulously processed the data and embedded them in the historic events of the time. Moreover, based on a memoir by Haig Aramian, Sakayan recounts the adventurous story of how in June 1916 the couple Sigrist-Hilty helped their Armenian storehouse manager Aramian to escape certain death. The structure of the book presented itself from the available archival materials. The book consists of three parts, each centered around one main character: Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty, and Haig Aramian. Through a thoughtful interplay of primary and secondary texts, Sakayan tells a coherent story of endless human suffering, but also of Christian compassion and selflessness.\n\nAt an early stage of her career, Sakayan’s knowledge of languages directed her towards translation and interpretation, and some of her translations were published early on. Sakayan has translated texts of various length and genres, from books to mini-texts, from poems to novels, and from gambits to proverbs. This furthered her interest in the theoretical aspects of translation. During the Summer semesters between 1981 and 1986, her contact and collaboration with the Translation Department of Saarbrücken University in Germany (Chairman: Dr. Wolfram Wilss) intensified her involvement and productivity in that field and resulted in several articles published in scholarly journals and books, as well as in several papers presented at international conferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"Pegasus\" is empty; there is nothing to which it refers. Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know what the sentence \"Pegasus has two wings\" means. We can even understand the sentence \"There is no such thing as Pegasus.\" But, what can the meaning of a proper name be, except the object to which it refers?\n\nThere are three broad ways which philosophers have tried to approach this problem.\n\nSome philosophers, such as Alexius Meinong have argued that there are two senses of the verb \"exists\", exemplified by the sentence \"there are things that do not exist\". The first, signified by \"there are\", is the so-called \"wide sense\", including Pegasus, the golden mountain, the round square, and so on. The second, signified by \"exist\" is the so-called \"narrow sense\", encompassing only things that are real or existent. The difficulty with this \"two sense\" theory is that there is no strong evidence that there really are two such distinct senses of the verb \"to be\".\n\n"}

{"id": "7115965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7115965", "title": "IETF language tag", "text": "IETF language tag\n\nAn IETF language tag is an abbreviated language code (for example, \"en\" for English, \"pt-BR\" for Brazilian Portuguese, or \"nan-Hant-TW\" for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters) defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the \"BCP 47\" document series, which is currently composed of normative RFC 5646 (referencing the related RFC 5645) and RFC 4647, along with the normative content of the \"IANA Language Subtag Registry\". Components of language tags are drawn from ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1, and UN M.49.\n\nThese language tags are used in a number of modern computing standards, including those from the IETF related to the Internet protocols such as HTTP, those from the World Wide Web Consortium such as HTML, XML and PNG, and those from other private standardization bodies such as SGML or Unicode (in some of its standard annexes), or from national or regional standard bodies like ANSI or Ecma (for example in some of their standards related to computing languages, or bibliographic references and documents classification used in institutional libraries).\n\nIETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by Harald Tveit Alvestrand, published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.\n\nIn January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.\n\nThe next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and Mark Davis and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> (which deals with matching behaviour). <nowiki>RFC 4646</nowiki> introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with <nowiki>RFC 3066</nowiki>.\n\nThe current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.\n\nEach language tag is composed of one or more \"subtags\" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.\n\nWith the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an \"x-\" prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an \"i-\" prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:\n\nSubtags are not case-sensitive, but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are UPPERCASE, script subtags are Title Case, and all other subtags are lowercase. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.\n\nOptional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag. For example, \"es\" is preferred over \"es-Latn\", as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; \"ja\" is preferred over \"ja-JP\", as Japanese \"as used in Japan\" does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.\n\nNot all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags. For example, the \"valencia\" variant subtag for the Valencian dialect of Catalan is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix \"ca\". As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag \"ES\" can normally be omitted.\n\nIETF language tags have been used as locale identifiers in many applications. It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki> is not adequate.\n\nThe use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in <nowiki>RFC 5646</nowiki> and <nowiki>RFC 4647</nowiki>. The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags. Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them. These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.\n\nAlthough some types of subtags are derived from ISO or UN core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, or UN M.49 remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.\n\nThis stability was introduced in RFC 4646.\n\nRFC 4646 defined the concept of an \"extended language subtag\" (sometimes referred to as \"extlang\"), although no such subtags were registered at that time.\n\nRFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to ISO 639-3 codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix \"sgn\". These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (\"cmn\" for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (\"zh-cmn\"). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called \"extlang form\" and is new in RFC 5646.\n\nWhole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as \"grandfathered\" or \"redundant\" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3–based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, \"nan\" is preferred over \"zh-min-nan\" for Min Nan Chinese; \"hak\" is preferred over \"i-hak\" and \"zh-hakka\" for Hakka Chinese; and \"ase\" is preferred over \"sgn-US\" for American Sign Language.\n\nISO 639-5 defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.\n\nFor example, the ISO 639-2 code \"afa\" was previously associated with the name \"Afro-Asiatic (Other)\", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named \"Afro-Asiatic languages\" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.\n\nTo avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).\n\nBCP 47 defines a \"Scope\" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.\n\nISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as \"Multiple languages\" and \"Undetermined\".\n\nIn contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.\n\nScript subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in ISO 15924. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.\n\nSome primary language subtags are defined with a property named \"Suppress-Script\" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, \"yi\" is preferred over \"yi-Hebr\" in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the Yiddish language.\n\nAs another example, \"zh-Hans-SG\" may be considered equivalent to \"zh-Hans\", because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.\n\nNote that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, \"Hans\" and \"Hant\" for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, \"Latf\" and \"Latg\" script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.\n\nTwo-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or \"exceptionally reserved\", in ISO 3166-1. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on UN M.49 would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as codice_1 for South America.\n\nRegion subtags are used to specify the variety of a language \"as used in\" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing British English (\"en-GB\") from American English (\"en-US\"). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for simplified versus traditional Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, \"zh-Hans\" and \"zh-Hant\" should be used instead of \"zh-CN\" and \"zh-HK\".\n\nWhen a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, \"ar-DZ\" (Arabic as used in Algeria) may be better expressed as \"arq\" for Algerian Spoken Arabic.\n\n\"Extension subtags\" (not to be confused with \"extended language subtags\") allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.\n\nExtension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than \"x\"), called a \"singleton\". Each extension is described in its own IETF RFC, which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. IANA is responsible for allocating singletons.\n\nTwo extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.\n\nExtension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag \"en-t-jp\" could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.\n\nExtension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.\n\nExtension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Tags containing a \"u-\" extension are more likely to be used to identify locale data sets than for purely linguistic content.\n\nSome examples include:\n\nExtension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the Unicode Consortium.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1828083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1828083", "title": "Linguistic turn", "text": "Linguistic turn\n\nThe linguistic turn was a major development in Western philosophy during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of philosophy and the other humanities primarily on the relationship between philosophy and language.\n\nVery different intellectual movements were associated with the \"linguistic turn\", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by Richard Rorty's 1967 anthology \"The Linguistic Turn\", in which it means the turn towards linguistic philosophy. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase \"the linguistic turn\" originated with philosopher Gustav Bergmann.\n\nTraditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of analytic philosophy. One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on logic and philosophy of language, and the cleavage between ideal language philosophy and ordinary language philosophy.\n\nAccording to Michael Dummett, the linguistic turn can be dated to Gottlob Frege's 1884 work \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\", specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition. \n\nIn order to answer a Kantian question about numbers, \"How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?\" Frege invokes his \"context principle\", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining \"the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs.\" Thus an ontological and epistemological problem, traditionally solved along idealist lines, is instead solved along linguistic ones.\n\nThis concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to \"facts\" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher Bertrand Russell in \"On Denoting\", and played a weighty role in his early work in logical atomism.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on language games in his later work. His later work (specifically \"Philosophical Investigations\") significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition. \n\nW. V. O. Quine describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\": \"Meaning is what essence becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word.\"\n\nLater in the twentieth century, philosophers like Saul Kripke in \"Naming and Necessity\" drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.\n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the Continental structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to poststructuralism with the input of Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas. Influential poststructuralist theorists include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by Hayden White.\n\nThese various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts. According to this view, there is something like 'the \"real\" chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, \"chair\", to which the linguistic word \"chair\" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no \"real\" chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair \"as\" a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is \"not\" everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as \"reality\" is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called \"language\".\n\n\n\n"}

The belief was that direct grammar instruction was not required for improved instruction in writing. Despite more recent research that has shown the positive effects of grammar instruction, the attitude that it is unnecessary persists today.\n\nBecause grammar has not been taught in many years, generations of teachers were never exposed to its direct instruction. Thus, even though many wish to teach it in their classrooms they do not find that they have adequate knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately this often perpetuates linguistic stereotypes that can sometimes be discriminatory to speakers on what are believed to be non standard dialects or languages.\nAnother issue is that the curriculum for teachers is already very broad, especially in comparison to other college students, so requiring further courses for would-be teachers is rather unpopular. The same problem exists in the K-12 classroom which already have difficult time constraints on their current curriculum. To add grammar to an already full curriculum is extremely difficult.\n\nStudies of how grammar and other linguistic theory can be incorporated into K-12 classrooms have been highly successful both in improving students' conscious knowledge of grammar and changing attitudes about non-standard English dialects. There is evidence that grammar instruction can be beneficial to students' writing such that replacing writing or vocabulary instruction with grammar can actually be a more productive use of class time.\n\nLinguists have also been involved in this field in attempts to change misconceptions about language. One common example is the definition of nouns. Traditionally a noun is defined as a \"person, place, or thing\". While this definition captures much of what nouns are it does not incorporate all possible definitions and uses. For example, mental concepts such as \"belief\" or \"idea\" are also nouns but do not neatly fit the traditional definition. This can be especially difficult for children to understand. A more comprehensive definition seeks to describe nouns through their features and uses. However this definition requires the teacher to have greater knowledge of English syntax.\n\n"}

{"id": "13056435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13056435", "title": "Lithuanian press ban", "text": "Lithuanian press ban\n\nThe Lithuanian press ban () was a ban on all Lithuanian language publications printed in the Latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the Russian Empire, which controlled Lithuania at the time. Lithuanian-language publications that used Cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged. \n\nThe concept arose after the failed January Uprising of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 26 April 1904. The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities.\n\nUnder the ban, it was illegal to print, import, distribute, or possess any publications in the Latin alphabet. Tsarist authorities hoped that this measure, part of a larger Russification plan, would decrease Polish influence on Lithuanians and would return them to what were considered their ancient historical ties with Russia. However, Lithuanians organized printing outside the Empire, largely in Lithuania Minor (East Prussia), and in the United States. \n\nKnygnešiai (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal books and periodicals across the border. The number of such publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern nation would never have been created.\n\nThe first book published in print in the Lithuanian language was Lutheran Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas in 1547. Other milestone publications included Daniel Klein's \"Grammar\" in 1653, a publication of the Bible in 1735, and the first work of imaginative literature, Kristijonas Donelaitis' \"Metai\" (The Seasons), in 1818. During the years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted from 1569 to 1781, the Polish language gained ground as the written \"lingua franca\" of greater Lithuania, although the Prussian areas of Lithuania Minor continued to issue publications in Lithuanian.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, use of the Lithuanian language was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas, apart from its use in Prussia; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the Samogitian region. Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of comparative linguistics; after the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861, social mobility increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe. Within the Catholic Church, the barriers that had earlier prevented commoners from entering the priesthood were eased. A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including a sympathy with their wish to use the Lithuanian language. The emerging national movement sought to distance itself from both Polish and Russian influences, and the use of the Lithuanian language was seen as an important aspect of this movement.\n\nAccording to the bibliographer Vaclovas Biržiška, between 1800 and 1864, when the press ban was enacted, 926 book titles were published in the Lithuanian language using its Latin alphabet. The orthography of the language was not standardized; this problem was used by the Russian authorities as a rationale for the change to Cyrillic.\n\nAfter the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century, significant portions of Lithuania and Poland were incorporated into the Russian Empire. The uprising of 1863, seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth, convinced many Russian politicians that Polish cultural and political influence was the main obstacle hindering the Russification of Lithuania. They believed that if the Lithuanian peasantry were distanced from the Polonized nobility and the Catholic Church, Lithuanians would naturally come under Russian cultural influence, as they had allegedly been during previous eras. The Russian politician Nikolai Miliutin wrote that \"Russian letters will finish that which was begun with the Russian sword.\"\n\nOn 13 May 1863 Tsar Alexander II of Russia appointed Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov as the Governor General of the Vilna Governorate. His duties included both suppression of the uprising, and implementation of the Russification policy. Because the situation was perceived as critical, Muravyov was temporarily granted extremely wide powers. Muravyov and Ivan Petrovich Kornilov, the newly appointed director of the Vilnius educational district, prepared a radical long-term Russification program that became known as the \"Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings\" (). Its stated goals were to:\n\nOn 22 May 1864 Tsar Alexander II approved this program. A few days later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on September 6, 1865 by Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, Muravyov's successor. Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees enforce it without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by Pyotr Valuev, Minister of the Interior. In 1866 the ban was further extended to include all academic books.\n\nDespite its strict and widespread enforcement, none of the ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval. When the special temporary powers of the Governor General were revoked in 1871, these administrative orders lost any legal value. From that point on the ban had no legal basis, but it was still strictly enforced.\n\nAt first the Russian authorities encouraged and sponsored the publication of Lithuanian-language works in the Cyrillic alphabet. The idea of replacing the Latin alphabet with Cyrillic was first elaborated by the well-known Pan-Slavist Alexander Hilferding in his 1863 book \"Lithuania and Samogitia\". \n\nThe first experiments with the conversion of Lithuanian writings into Cyrillic were conducted by a Lithuanian linguist, Jonas Juška. He showed some samples of adapted texts to both Muravyov and Kornilov in February 1864. However, Juška discontinued his work and Kornilov formed a committee to work on publishing Lithuanian books in Cyrillic. The committee had four members: the Polish librarian Stanisław Mikucki from Warsaw, Russian Jonas Kerčinskis, a Lithuanian Catholic priest who had converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, Antanas Petkevičius, and the well-known Lithuanian educator and publisher Laurynas Ivinskis. Ivinskis soon withdrew from the committee. The first such book was a primer intended for use in the new Russian schools that were replacing the Lithuanian parish schools. It appeared during the summer of 1864. The committee also published a prayer book, a calendar, and other religious literature.\n\nAbout 55 Lithuanian-Cyrillic titles were published during the 40 years of the ban; about half of these were published during its first decade. Seeing that the Lithuanian people were unwilling to accept these books, even when they were offered for free, the Russian government shifted its attention to eliminating the illegal publications.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Education issued a report in May 1898 recommending that the press ban be repealed. The report stated that the ban had produced adverse and unforeseen results, including the development of Lithuanian nationalism. Other Russian officials had opined that the interests of the Russian state would be better served by the presence of a legal Lithuanian press that could be censored.\n\nDuring the years of the ban, 3,047 people (829 smugglers, 859 distributors, and 1,359 persons possessing banned books) were arrested in connection with the ban.\n\nAnti-Russian sentiment and distrust of the tsarist authorities had arisen after the 1863 revolt. The ban was also perceived as a threat to the Catholic Church; the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Latin alphabet was also a symbolic loyalty to Catholicism. Attempts were made to circumvent the ban by using Gothic script. However, that was also banned in 1872. A number of problems arose with the various Lithuanian-Cyrillic orthographies, which were all criticized as ill-adapted to the Lithuanian language. Within Russia, the ban was opposed by scholarly, liberal, and pro-democratic groups, which served to mitigate the punishments.\n\nThe organized resistance to the ban, both legal and illegal, was largely initiated by bishop Motiejus Valančius, who petitioned the government to exempt prayer books from the ban. He then moved towards sponsoring the illegal flow of books from outside Lithuania. The period from Valančius death in 1875 to 1883 saw the establishment of the Lithuanian-language newspaper \"Auszra\" (The Dawn), and the resistance at this time is associated with bishop Antanas Baranauskas. The resistance intensified towards the end of the 19th century, after another major newspaper, \"Varpas\" (The Bell), edited by Vincas Kudirka, was established in 1889. Between 1891 and 1893, 31,718 publications were confiscated and destroyed; between 1900 and 1902 this number increased to 56,182, reflecting their increased flow.\n\nThe period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet. The majority of these were published in Tilsit, a city in East Prussia, although some publications reached Lithuania from the United States. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and Aukštaitijan (highland) usages; the letters -č- and -š- were taken from Czech orthography. The widely accepted \"Lithuanian Grammar\", by Jonas Jablonskis, appeared in 1901.\n\nA number of challenges to the ban's legal basis were made, and the use of this venue intensified at the end of the 19th century, along with an increasing number of letters, petitions, and protests from Lithuanians. In 1902 and 1903 the Russian Supreme Court reversed two press ban convictions that had been brought against Antanas Macijauskas and Povilas Višinskis. The court's decisions stated that the original executive decree creating the ban was illegal. The outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904 contributed to the Russian government's perception that its minorities needed to be accommodated. The ban was officially lifted on 26 April 1904.\n\nPublic and private education in Lithuanian was adversely affected by the press ban. The level of pent-up demand for schooling in the 19th century is illustrated by the increase in literacy in the Rietavas area; between 1853 and 1863, just before the ban, the number of literate persons rose from 11,296 to 24,330. The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to illiteracy in 19th-century Lithuania.\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.\n\nA census of the Kovno Governorate in 1897 showed that a higher proportion of older people than younger had received formal education: of persons age 30 to 39, 61.87% had experienced some level of formal education, compared to only 54.68% of persons aged 10 to 19.\n\nAfter the ban was lifted, printing presses and their supporting social and cultural infrastructure needed to be established. The first issue of a Lithuanian newspaper after the ban, \"Vilniaus žinios\", appeared on December 23, 1904; the Great Seimas of Vilnius, which took place in November 1905, was now able to issue its announcements and publications in Lithuanian.\n\nThe publishing houses of Martynas Kukta, Saliamonas Banaitis, and the Society of St. Casimir in Kaunas were responsible for many of the publications issued between the end of the ban in 1904 and the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1918. The businessman Petras Vileišis installed a printing press at his palace, commissioned in 1904. During this period 4,734 Lithuanian-language titles in the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania and abroad. After Lithuanian independence was established, the rate of publication increased steadily; 16,721 book titles were printed from 1918 to 1939. Between 1925 and 1939 about 800 to 900 book titles were printed annually.\n\nA standard Lithuanian orthography and grammar were established during the ban, despite the fact that the co-ordination of this process, involving competing dialects, was forced to take place in several countries. The ban is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement, rather than discouraging it. In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the ban's end was noted in UNESCO's events calendar, and the Lithuanian Seimas declared the \"Year of the Lithuanian Language and Book.\" \n"}

Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: \"Ummul-al-Sinnah\"). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing Max Muller (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.\n\nA short Treatise, namely \"Minan-ur-Rahman\" (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963) \n\nApparently the book appears to be in response to Max Muller's belief that:\n\nAhmad strongly reacted to this claim and refuted Max Muller's proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews \nAhmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.\n[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.\n\nAhmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:\n\nHe claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. \"He created man then taught him speech and guided him \" (page 85).\n\nIn this book \"Minan-ur-Rahman\" Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of \"Mufradaat\" [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,\n\nHe explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp. 10–11)\n\nفِ (fi) 'Be faithful'\n\nقِ (qi) 'Keep an eye on'\n\nلِ (li) 'Come nearer'\n\nعِ ('I) 'Call to mind'\n\nاِ (I) 'Promise'\n\nخِ (Khe) 'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'\n\nہِ (hi) 'Burst thyself, or become weak'\n\nدِ (di) 'Pay blood-money'\n\nرِ (ri) 'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'\n\nشِ (shi) 'Paint thy garments with patterns '\n\nنِ (ni) 'Be slow or lazy'\n\nAhmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small single words give extensive meanings: e.g.\n\nعرضتُ (\"araztu\") means: \"I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them.\"\n\nطہفلتُ (\"Tahfaltu\") means: \"I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread .\"\n\nجثمَ (\"Jasama\") means: \"Half the night has passed\".\n\nحیعلَ (\"Haya-al\") means: \"Come; Pray! It is proper time.\"\n\n\"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to\nother languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon.\" (page 100).\n\nAhmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah, Genesis 11:1:-\n\nHe after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:\n\nAhmad highlighted \"Five\" points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]\n\n1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.\n\n2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.\n\n3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.\n\n4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.\n\n5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.\n\nA greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, \" Thousands of languages\nare stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man.\" [page. 22]\n\nAfter the above \"Introductory details\", the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]\nHe explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these \"Two\" requirements, Arabic has \"Two\" distinct words for \"Mercy\", \"Rahman\" [رحمان]and \"Raheem\". [رحیم].\nTo explain his point, Ahmad writes:\n\nAhmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the \"Ten Circles of Roots\". He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)\n\nHow did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: \" On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle.\" \n\nA renowned Philologist Sheikh Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words.

{"id": "57049891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57049891", "title": "Mock language", "text": "Mock language\n\nMock language is a term in linguistic anthropology for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's language ideology of the hegemonic language.\n\nWhen talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term \"Mock Spanish\" was popularized in the 1990s by Jane H. Hill, a linguist at the University of Arizona, mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern United States, where Hill first researched the phenomenon. The term \"Mock\" has since been applied to other languages, and the umbrella term \"Mock language\" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.\n\nThe speaker is unintentionally indexing a language ideology that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.\n\nWhen using mock language, the speaker is showing their 'cosmopolitanism' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This hegemony creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.\n\nFor the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken. \nThe term \"Mock Spanish\" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as \"Mock-Languages.\" Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media—such as television and social networking applications—during the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.\n\nHill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in New York uses their bilingualism. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes marked and \"sharply objectified\" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all. This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how semantic domains index a state. Saying something is \"el cheapo\" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.\n\nIn a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. “...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.” This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.\n\nMock white girl shows how the intentional use of vocal fry to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.\n\nAnother semantic domain is language crossing. “Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.” This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.\n\nMock language is used in anthropology and linguistics to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.\n\nThe study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. “It is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.” This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.\n\nIn the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language. Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as “American”. There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet “mock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.” Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.\n\nWhile not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered pronouns of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.\n\nMock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical \"white girl's\" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features uptalk, creaky voice, blondness and the stereotypical association with Starbucks.\n\nMock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not code switch between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know Hindi when using it in such a context. \nIt has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where \"speaking\" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say \"el\" or add an \"o\" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.\n\n“Mock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually “loose,” and unintelligent Spanish speaker.” \n\nPopular T-shirts for young women with the saying \"namaste in bed\". This borrows the traditional greeting from Hindi and makes it into a pun of the slang term \"imma stay in bed\". It also associates the Hindi word as a yoga term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.\n\nCinco de Mayo, a holiday that celebrates Mexico’s defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term “Cinco de Drinko” has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday’s history and an example of the “add ‘o’” phenomenon. The “add ‘o’” phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an “o” to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.\n\nYouTuber “Sprinkle of Glitter” would open videos until 2017 saying “Aloha Sprinklerinos”. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.\n\n\"Mock White Girl\" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film \"Mean Girls,\" character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.\nBars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for \"thank you\", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.\n\nThe signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but \"das boot\" in German translates as “the boat” and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.\n"}

The NCVS is located in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Lead Institution located at the University of Utah. NCVS is also a Center at the University of Iowa where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology. In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States. Its focus is vocology, or the science and practice of voice habilitation.\n\nInitially conceived as a \"center without walls,\" the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the DCPA, University of Iowa, University of Utah, University of Wisconsin–Madison) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.\n\nIn 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.\n\nThe NCVS team of investigators, led by Ingo Titze, studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, physics, computer science, acoustics, vocal performance, biology, medicine and engineering) to work together on voice and speech investigations. As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public. One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of Vocology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4788296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4788296", "title": "Plato's Problem", "text": "Plato's Problem\n\nPlato's Problem is the term given by Noam Chomsky to \"the problem of explaining how we can know so much\" given our limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this is referred to as the \"argument from poverty of the stimulus\" (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always \"underdetermined by evidence\". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.\n\nWhat is knowledge? What is experience? How do they interact? Is there a correlational, causal, or reciprocal relationship between knowledge and experience? These and other related questions have been at the forefront of investigation by problem solvers, scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. These questions, but particularly the problem of how experience and knowledge interrelate, have broad theoretical and practical implications for such academic disciplines as epistemology, linguistics, and psychology (specifically the subdiscipline of thinking and problem solving). Gaining a more precise understanding of human knowledge, whether defined as innate, experiential, or both, is an important part of effective problem solving.\n\nPlato was the first philosopher who systematically inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as Euthyphro and the Apology, but it is from the Meno that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess innate ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.\n\nAs formulated by Noam Chomsky, accounting for this gap between knowledge and experience is \"Plato's Problem\". The phrase has a specific linguistic context with regard to language acquisition but can also be used more generally.\n\nPlato's early philosophical endeavors involved poetry discussing many ideas, such as the differences between knowledge and opinion, particulars and universals, and God and man. These early dialogues do not utilize conventional notions of reason. Rather, they appeal to the emotions, the allegorical, the spiritual, and the mythological interests of an ancient speculative mind.\n\nControversy surrounds the early dialogues in how they are to be interpreted. Some claim that Plato was truly trying to discover objective reality through these mystical speculations while others maintain that the dialogues are stories to be interpreted only as parables, allegories, and emotional appeals to religious experience. Regardless, Plato would come to formulate a more rigorous and comprehensive philosophy later in his life, one that reverberates in contemporary Western thought to this day.\n\nSome of Plato's famous works are Phaedo, the Crito, and, as noted earlier, the Meno. Within these works are found a comprehensive philosophy that addresses epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, theology, and logic. As noted, most of the writing is in the form of dialogues and arguments to pursue answers to difficult questions and concepts. Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.\n\nMost of Plato's philosophical ideas were communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as a presence in the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.\n\nAs delineated in various writings, the meticulousness, articulation, and sophistication with which Socrates spoke supplies an outstanding problem solving technique – the Socratic Method. The Socratic method may be described as follows: it usually involves others with whom Socrates directly engages (not merely pontificating to an audience), it involves a deep philosophical or ethical question to which an answer was sought, and it usually involves Socrates asking questions either to affirm his understanding of others or to seek their understanding.\n\nIf someone disagreed with him, Socrates would execute this process in order to bring about his interlocutor's reluctant admission of inconsistencies and contradictions. Either Socrates would ask his debators questions about their claims that would lead them to admit their fallacy or Socrates would answer questions by posing questions meant to lead the other to answer their own query.\n\nOne such dialogue of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, and one of Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught. Socrates responds by stating that he does not know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.\n\nMeno seems to commit two fallacies when trying to define virtue. He either defines it using some form of the word itself, or he defines it using other words that call for definitions and explanations themselves. Eventually, Meno is led to confess his shortcomings as he tries to define the enigmatic term (the Socratic method is the mechanism that brings about this confession). Socrates claims that a definition of virtue must consist of common terms and concepts that are clearly understood by those in the discussion.\n\nA crucial point in the dialogue is when Socrates tells Meno that there is no such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.\n\nShortly before the demonstration of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown that the answer to the question posed is innateness – one possesses \"a priori\" knowledge.\n\nThis is derived from Socrates' belief that one's soul existed in past lives and knowledge is transferred from those lives to the current one. \"These [ideas] were revealed in a former state of existence, and are recovered by reminiscence (anamnesis) or association from sensible things\" . The claim is that one does not need to know what knowledge is before gaining knowledge, but rather one has a wealth of knowledge before ever gaining any experience.\n\nThere are contemporary contexts that provide input for the various questions posed here: how to account for the gap between experience and knowledge, what are some of the sources of knowledge, or how much knowledge is possessed prior to experience or without conscious awareness. There are many areas in contemporary linguistics and psychological research that have relevance to these epistemological questions. Linguistic analysis has provided some strong evidence for innate cognitive capacities for language and there are many areas of cognitive psychology that yield hard data from investigations into sources of knowledge. In addition, there are some claims in the Meno that have connections to current research on perception and long-term memory (LTM).\n\nLinguistics is the scientific study of language. Chomskyan linguistics (\"an inclusive, though perhaps informal, label for the theories and methodologies of linguistic study spearheaded by Noam Chomsky, meant to encompass his extensive work and influence in the field\") includes everything from Chomsky's earliest work in transformational grammar to more recent work in the Minimalist Program. More exactly, it is the study of the structure of language, or grammar. Chomskyan linguistics is defined by a particular theoretical foundation and methodological approach that sets it apart from other linguistic perspectives, such as those described by functional grammar or structuralism (per Leonard Bloomfield) for example. This particular approach to the study of language is also often referred to as Generative linguistics, which is attributed to Chomsky and his early generative grammar work.\n\nThere are several concepts important to the Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these ideas is the theory of universal grammar (UG). Simply put, and as implied by the name, UG refers to those grammatical properties thought to be shared by all (to be universal to all) derivations of human language (anything from Amharic to Zhuang).\n\nPer this conceptualization, UG is innate to all humans – people come \"pre-wired\" with this universal grammatical structure. A person's individual grammar (that which is unique to the person) develops from the interaction between the innate universal grammar and input from the environment, or primary linguistic data. This \"analytic triplet\" (McGilvray, ed., 2005, p. 51), UG + input = grammar, is the functional core of the theory.\n\nSeveral questions (or problems) motivate linguistic theorizing and investigation. Two such taken up in Chomskyan linguistics are the process of language acquisition in children, and \"Plato's Problem\". These subjects are interrelated and viewed as evidence in support of the theory of UG.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to approach the concept of universal grammar is to pose a hypothetical question about an aspect of language acquisition in children – why does a child learn the language that it does. As a specific example, how can a child of Asian descent (say, born of Chinese parents) be set down in the middle of Topeka, Kansas and acquire \"perfect English?\" The answer is that the child does not start with \"Chinese\", or any other conventionally defined language, in its head. The child does start with general grammatical rules that determine linguistic properties.\n\nChildren come equipped with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All that is needed is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG does not have the necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.\n\nThe hypothetical question posed addresses a common misconception about what is instantiated in the mind/brain of an individual when it comes to language. It does not address the \"logical problem\" of language acquisition, i.e., how children transition from ostensibly having no knowledge of language to having full knowledge, in what may be described as a very limited time with apparently limited input.\n\n\nTo address the issue of apparently limited input, one must turn to what is possibly the most quoted of all arguments in support of universal grammar and its nativist interpretation – Plato's Problem. The phrase refers to the Socratic dialogue, the Meno; Noam Chomsky is often attributed with coining the term.\n\nNoam Chomsky's 1986 \"'Knowledge of Language' begins with informal characterization of 'Plato's Problem: The problem of explaining how we can know so much given so little evidence.'\"\n\n\"The Book is organized around a discussion of Plato's problem [Chomsky] quoting Russell[:]\"\n\nPlato’s Problem was expressed generally by Bertrand Russell: \"How comes it that human beings, whose contacts with the world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to know as much as they do know?\" The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.\nConsider some subtleties that people are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to \"negative data,\" information about what does not occur.\n\nPlato's Problem particularly refers to a point in the dialogue when Socrates is talking with an uneducated servant and shows, through this interaction, that the servant knows the Pythagorean Theorem though he has never been explicitly taught any geometry. How does the servant know without having ever been taught? Plato's suggestion is, essentially, that people have innate knowledge.\n\nIn the field of linguistics, Plato's Problem is the problem of finding an explanation for how a child acquires language though the child does not receive explicit instruction and the primary linguistic data a child does receive is limited. This PLD is the input, or stimuli, from the environment, necessary for the development of an individual's grammar – language – via input into UG. This limited environmental stimulus is referred to as poverty of the stimulus. Specifically, the stimuli to which children are exposed during the critical period do not encompass every lawful example of grammatical structure relevant to the particular language.\n\nFor instance, consider that a child might hear the following examples:\n\nFrom this, the child might determine that the word that is optional and from this analogize to the following examples:\n\nClearly, the second example is not a grammatically well-formed sentence in English. A child knows this and does not form sentences such as the one marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the ungrammatical example is, in fact, ungrammatical? From the linguistic perspective being described here, the answer to this question is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.\n\nPlato's Problem describes the disparity between input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar). As Plato suggests in the Meno dialogue, the bridge between input (whether limited or lacking) and output is innate knowledge. Poverty of the stimulus is crucial to the Platonic argument and it is a linchpin concept in Chomskyan linguistics. For this reason, Plato's Problem is often used synonymously to mean poverty of the stimulus. Specific to linguistics, the formulation of this problem is evidence for the existence of universal grammar. Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.\n\nThere have been studies of perception and attention that support the idea that there is an abundance of knowledge available to an individual at any given moment (Blake & Sekuler, 2006).\n\nA key ingredient to the beginning stages of perception requires the attention of the observer on some focal point or stimulus. There is a presupposition that if one visually perceives an object, one knows that one is seeing it (excluding the exception of perceptual illusions). Whatever sensory stimuli are attended to can be declared knowledge.\n\nStimuli that are directly attended to are projected onto the fovea, the central point of the retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to binocular vision. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of the left and right eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.\n\nSome examples from auditory perception research will be helpful in explaining the fact that our perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the \"cocktail party phenomenon\" (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific \"trigger\" words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.\n\nThe auditory findings are further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message in one ear is supposed to be shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.\n\nThere is also the subject of subliminal priming (Nisbett & Ross, 1980), in which a stimulus is perceived outside of conscious awareness. For example, in an experiment, half of a class was presented with a picture of a boy holding a birthday cake, while the other half was presented with a different picture of the same boy holding a birthday cake. The sole difference between the two was that in the first picture the boy had a mischievous facial expression, while in the second he conveyed an innocent smile. The photos were presented in a flash of 100 ms, then another picture was presented to both groups with the boy smiling. Results were that the first group described him as devilish and naughty, and the second group depicted him as angelic and kind. Due to the short presentation of the pictures, the subjects were not consciously aware of the nature of the original photos and when presented with them afterwards, participants were surprised.\n\nThese studies point to the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of knowledge at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.\n\nThis LTM availability/accessibility dichotomy is analogous to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge as a result of information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against immortality is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not cognizant of many of those ideas because they have yet to be recalled.\n\nHaving discussed Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, and some cognitive structures, various implications that arise from the research and theorizing can be touched on. The debate surrounding how to define knowledge goes back to the origin of humanity. In historical philosophy, the debate has been between rationalism and empiricism. In contemporary psychology, the debate is between biology (nature) and environment (nurture).\n\nRationalism is a philosophical and epistemological perspective on knowledge that claims, at its most extreme, that reason is the only dependable source of knowledge; moreover, rationalists assert that \"a priori\" knowledge is the most effective foundation for knowledge . Empiricism, on the other hand, argues that no knowledge exists prior to experience; therefore, all knowledge, as well as thought, comes from experience. The nature and nurture debate is not identical, and yet has similarities, or parallels, to the rationalism versus empiricism debate. Those who claim that thought and behavior result from nature say the cause is genetic predisposition while those who argue for environment say that thought and behavior are caused by learning, parenting, and socialization.\n\nIn contemporary philosophical, linguistic, and psychological circles, it is rare that anyone maintains an unwavering stance on either of these extremes, most fall toward the middle. For many, the ideas of \"nature and nurture\" or \"innateness and environmental input\" are no longer perceived as mutually exclusive. For those who research such topics, much points to a necessarily interactive relationship in order for thought and behavior to occur.\n\nIn Plato's philosophy, innate ideas are revealed through the Socratic Method of investigation. In linguistics, universal grammar must have input from the environment (primary linguistic data) in order for children to achieve an individual grammar (output). Biologically, our perceptual faculties are pre-wired, but they require environmental stimuli in order to develop correctly. The neurological structures in our brain that represent the location of LTM are also biologically pre-wired, yet environmental input is needed in order for memory to flourish.\n\nAll of these ideas speak to the crux of Plato's Problem, which is how to account for the gap between knowledge and limited experience. For some scientific and philosophical disciplines, the answer to this conundrum is innateness, or biological pre-wiring. Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.\n\n"}

{"id": "12689044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12689044", "title": "Speech-to-text reporter", "text": "Speech-to-text reporter\n\nA speech-to-text reporter (STTR), also known as a captioner, is a person who listens to what is being said and inputs it, word for word (verbatim), using an electronic shorthand keyboard or speech recognition software and a CAT software system. Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words. The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people.\n\nThe latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers. Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or voice silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. A voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.\n\nA real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.\n\nVoice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and \"inner\" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from \"inner voice\" to the physiological \"spoken voice.\" Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.\n\nVoice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.\n\nOther ways of producing speech-to-text: There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the Stenograph system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as palantypists and stenographers. Unlike a QWERTY keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed computer software will then convert these phonetic chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read.\n\nThe computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses. Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next.\n\nThe professional association for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters. The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.\n\nEvery word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words \"NEW SPEAKER:\" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking. Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events.\n\nOccasional mondegreen errors may be seen in closed-captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream. For example, a news report of a \"grand parade\" might be captioned as a \"grandpa raid\". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.\n\nMany STTRs began their careers as court reporters. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.\n\nIn order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.\n\nIf becoming a voice writing STTR, the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous. Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.\n\nOnly then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification. In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training.\n\nThere are many levels of certification. NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners. Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field.\n\nThe NVRA certification testing program is available to all members. Tests are held at regular intervals throughout the year in various locations across the country.\n\nIn the UK, Unitised CACDP Examinations and membership with the CACDP Register, confirms that one has reached the required minimum standard. The majority of Registered STTRs are also Members of the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.\n\n\n"}

A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- \"together\" and χρόνος \"time\") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a diachronic approach (from δια- \"through\" and χρόνος \"time\") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. Historical linguistics is typically a diachronic study.\n\nThe concepts were theorized by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of general linguistics in Geneva from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous \"Course in General Linguistics\" published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into philosophy and sociology, for instance by Roland Barthes and Jean-Paul Sartre. Jacques Lacan also used it for psychoanalysis. Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by Polish linguists Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and Mikołaj Kruszewski of the Kazan school, who used the terms statics and dynamics of language.\n"}
{"id": "26860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26860", "title": "Syntax", "text": "Syntax\n\nIn linguistics, syntax () is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language, usually including word order. The term \"syntax\" is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes. The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages.\n\nIn mathematics, \"syntax\" refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as formal languages used in logic. (See logical syntax.)\n\nThe word \"syntax\" comes from Ancient Greek: \"coordination\", which consists of \"syn\", \"together\", and \"táxis\", \"an ordering\".\n\nA basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence SVO or the sequence SOV. The other possible sequences are VSO, VOS, OVS, and OSV, the last three of which are rare.\n\nWorks on grammar were written long before modern syntax came about; in Ancient India, the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" of Pāṇini (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory. In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as \"traditional grammar\" began with the work of Dionysius Thrax.\n\nFor centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as , first expounded in 1660 by Antoine Arnauld in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.\n\nHowever, in the 19th century, with the development of historical-comparative linguistics, linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore logic could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.\n\nThe Port-Royal grammar modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the Port-Royal Logic were copied or adapted from the \"Grammaire générale\".) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of \"subject – copula – predicate\". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as Franz Bopp.\n\nThe central role of syntax within theoretical linguistics became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the \"century of syntactic theory\" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001).)\n\nThere are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of Derek Bickerton, sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human mind. Other linguists (e.g., Gerald Gazdar) take a more Platonistic view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract formal system. Yet others (e.g., Joseph Greenberg) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.\n\nThe hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as \"i-language\"). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the grammaticality of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by Noam Chomsky. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.\n\nAmong the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:\n\nOther theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:\n\nDependency grammar is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of phrase structure grammars. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:\n\n\nLucien Tesnière (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.\n\nCategorial grammar is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the syntactic categories themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the phrase structure rule S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the head word itself. So the syntactic category for an intransitive verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a function word requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\\S) instead of V. NP\\S is read as \"a category that searches to the left (indicated by \\) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right).\" The category of transitive verb is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\\S)) which means \"a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence.\"\n\nTree-adjoining grammar is a categorial grammar that adds in partial tree structures to the categories.\n\nTheoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon probability theory are known as stochastic grammars. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a neural network or connectionism.\n\nFunctionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:\n\n\n\n"}

Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair, such as \"force majeure\". \n\nIn a total loss, the insurer must indemnify the assured in full, and ownership of the insured item thereby passes to the insurer under the legal process of \"subrogation\". Although the policy determines the level at which the loss becomes total rather than partial, nevertheless the assured (and NOT the insurer) has the final say as to whether he wishes to make a partial or total claim. \n\nIf the insured item is, say, a car or a house, the policy will normally give it a \"market value\" which may be less than the assured had in mind; any disagreement would need to be challenged, perhaps using arbitration. In marine insurance, policies may be valued (where the value of the ship or cargo is agreed) or unvalued (where a market value at the time of the claim would need to be ascertained). In the absence of fraud, the Marine Insurance Act 1906 states the agreed value in a valued policy is conclusive, except in cases of constructive total loss, as in \"The Costa Concordia\" and \"The Bamburi\".\n\nWritten off properties are usually demolished or torn down, scrapped, or recycled for parts after their policies are settled; so the insurer may be relieved not to have the insured item surrogated to him, as in \"Asfar v Blundell\" [1896].\n\nPolicies covering homes, vehicles, and other non-investment assets subject to depreciation may indemnify the insured to much less than the full replacement cost, so that the insured items may become \"total losses\" despite some residual value. \n\nAbout one in seven car accident claims results in a \"total\". Except in extreme circumstances, a vehicle that has been written off will not be completely worthless. This is because such a vehicle will usually still contain salvageable used parts, or at a bare minimum will still have value as scrap metal. All that is required for a vehicle to be a write-off is that it would cost more to return to marketable condition than the market value it would then have. So a vehicle of low value may even be written off when fully roadworthy, for example due to damage to paintwork or upholstery.\nIn many jurisdictions a vehicle designated as a total loss is sold by insurance companies to general public, auto dealers, auto brokers, or auto wreckers. The metrics insurance companies use to make the decision include the cost of the repairs needed plus the value of the remaining parts, added to the cost of reimbursing the driver for a rental while the car in question is repaired. If this figure exceeds the value of the car after it is repaired, the vehicle is deemed a total loss. In most jurisdictions, a decision by an insurer to write off a vehicle results in vehicle title branding, marking the car as \"salvage\" or (if repaired and reinspected under subsequent ownership) \"rebuilt\". If the vehicle is not severely damaged, however, it can be restored to its original condition. After a government approved inspection, the vehicle can be put back on the road. The inspection process may not attempt to assess the quality of the repairs. This function will be relegated to a professional mechanic or inspector. However, if the vehicle is severely damaged as per standards set by state or provincial governments, the vehicle is dismantled by an auto wrecker and is sold as parts or scrapped.\n\nOnce a vehicle has been written off and repaired the vehicle may still lose value. Diminished value is the reduction in a vehicle's market value occurring after a vehicle is wrecked and repaired, otherwise called accelerated depreciation. To collect diminished value after a car accident, insurance companies usually ask for a diminished value report.\n\nIn Canada, this is more commonly called \"accelerated depreciation\"; how a person goes about reclaiming those losses in either country is a different process. In some US states, insurance companies acknowledge diminished value and provide this coverage direct to their consumers. In Canada, in order to recuperate the lost value after an accident, a person needs to retain legal counsel and order an acceleration depreciation report on their car for the court's use.\n\nIn marine insurance, conventional marine insurers such as Lloyds will issue policies covering hull & machinery, or cargo, whereas P&I clubs cover third-party risks (such as a carrier's damage to cargo), pollution risks, and war risks. The term \"total loss\" can refer to any of these risks, but commonly involves a loss of the hull or cargo. Total losses may be actual total loss or constructive. \n\nAn actual total loss of a vessel occurs when repair is physically or legally impossible. A total loss may be presumed when a ship disappears and no news is received within a reasonable time. Some legal authorities do not consider it an actual total loss if repair costs are merely prohibitive, while others include cases where the cost of repair would exceed the cost of the vessel. In any case, the term \"legally impossible\" covers instances where reconstruction would be so extensive that the resulting craft would be legally considered a new vessel.\n\nA constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value of the vessel. It also covers cases where the vessel has been abandoned in the reasonable belief that a total loss is inevitable. The calculation can be affected by environmental cleanup costs.\n\nIf the policy is a \"valued\" policy (so that the ship or cargo has an \"agreed value\" rather than a \"market value\"), then, in the absence of fraud, the agreed value is conclusive, but only for an actual total loss. In a constructive total loss, the agreed value is NOT conclusive.\n\nIn aviation, the term \"hull loss\" is used in aviation accidents that damage the aircraft beyond economical repair, resulting in a total loss. The term also applies to situations when the aircraft is missing, the search for its wreckage is terminated, or when the wreckage is completely inaccessible.\n\n\n"}

The notion that language, or some specific sacred language, refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophical study as well as various traditions of magic, religious invocation and mysticism (mantras) since antiquity.\n\nThe true name of the Egyptian sun god Ra was revealed to Isis through an elaborate trick. This gave Isis complete power over Ra and allowed her to put her son Horus on the throne.\n\nSocrates in Plato's \"Cratylus\" considers, without taking a position, the possibility whether names are \"conventional\" or \"natural\" (\"true name\" [τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ὄνομα]), that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify (this anti-conventionalist position is called Cratylism).\n\nHellenistic Judaism emphasized the divine nature of \"logos\", later adopted by the Gospel of John. The true name of God plays a central role in Kabbalism (see Gematria, Temurah, YHWH [the tetragrammaton]) and to some extent in Sufism (see 100th name of God).\nThe ancient Jews considered God's true name so potent that its invocation conferred upon the speaker tremendous power over His creations. To prevent abuse of this power, as well as to avoid blasphemy, the name of God was always taboo, and increasingly disused so that by the time of Jesus their High Priest was supposedly the only individual who spoke it aloud — and then only in the Holy of Holies upon the Day of Atonement.\n\nAlso in a Biblical context, in the tale of Jacob's nocturnal wrestling with an anonymous angel, the angel refuses to reveal his own name to Jacob even after the angel's submission at dawn. Thereafter Jacob obtains a new name which signifies his successful struggle to God and man, and names the place to commemorate his surviving an encounter with the Divine.\n\nContemporary pre-industrial peoples guard secret names which are only used in solemn rituals. These names are never mentioned and kept from general knowledge.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as \"Alter\" (, literally \"old\"), or \"Alterke\", the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. \n\nWhen captured by Polyphemus, Homer's Odysseus is careful not to reveal his name; when asked for it, Odysseus tells the giant that he is \"Οὖτις\", which means \"nobody\". But later, having escaped after blinding Polyphemus and thinking himself beyond Polyphemus' power, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of hubris that was to cause enormous problems later. Knowing his name, Polyphemus was able to call upon Odysseus the revenge of his father, the god Poseidon. Many later episodes of the Odyssey depict Odysseus facing the relentless hostility of Poseidon - which he could have avoided had he persisted in keeping his real name secret. \nAccording to practises in folklore, referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being magically. It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales, such as in the German fairytale of \"Rumpelstiltskin\": within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.\n\nA legend of Saint Olaf recounts how a troll built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods. Similarly, the belief that children who were not baptised at birth were in particular danger of having the fairies kidnap them and leave changelings in their place may stem from their unnamed state. In the Scandinavian variants of the ballad \"Earl Brand\", the hero can defeat all his enemies until the heroine, running away with him, pleads with him by name to spare her youngest brother.\n\nIn Scandinavian beliefs, more magical beasts, such as the Nix, could be defeated by calling their name. For the same reason significant objects in Germanic mythology, which were considered to have some kind of intrinsic personality, had their own names too, for example the legendary Sword Balmung.\n\nMedieval beliefs about witchcraft indicated that the Devil baptized witches with a new, secret name.\n\nIn the folklore of Northern England, there was the belief that a boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n\nGiacomo Puccini used a similar theme in the opera Turandot. The plot turns on whether or not Princess Turandot could learn the name of her unwanted suitor. If she does, she could execute him; if she doesn't, she would have to marry him.\n\nThe term \"true name\" is sometimes used in cryptography and computer security to refer to a name that is assumed to uniquely identify a principal in a global namespace (for example, an X.500 or X.509 Distinguished name). This usage is often critical, with the implication that use of true names is difficult to enforce and unwise to rely on. \n\nIn fantasy where magic works by evoking true names, characters often go to great lengths to conceal their true names. In some settings, such as Ursula K. Le Guin's \"Earthsea\", this is true for all beings. In others, as in Larry Niven's \"The Magic Goes Away\", it applies only to those of magical inclination, as where a wizard is revived from the dead only by another who found his name, and even then only with great difficulty. Finding a true name may require arcane procedures. In \"Earthsea\", a wizard must listen for and give the hero his true name; this is performed in both Le Guin's \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" and \"The Tombs of Atuan\".\n\n\nA character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life. In Hayao Miyazaki's movie \"Spirited Away\", the witch who runs the bathhouse, Yubaba, ensures loyalty by stealing the names of her subjects. For example, one of the witch's most loyal subjects, the spirit of the Kohaku River, has his name taken and is given a slave name: Haku. He forgets his name, and it is in this way 'taken' from him; he warns Chihiro Ogino against the dangers of forgetting her own name. She frees him when she recognises him and he then remembers and 'takes back' his name and is freed from the clutches of the witch.\n\nIn the cyberpunk genre following Vernor Vinge's 1981 \"True Names\" and the work of William Gibson, much of the plot involved interactions between people's virtual selves in cyberspace. Learning a fellow hacker's real-world name (i.e., their \"true name\") could allow you to turn them in to the government or otherwise blackmail them, conveying a kind of power that could be considered analogous to the equivalent concept of myth and legend.\n\n"}

The end of a TCU, called a \"transition relevance place\" (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.\n\nA Turn Construction Unit (TCU) is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.\n\nThere are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:\n\n1. Lexical TCU: e.g. \"Yes\", \"There\"\n2. Phrasal TCU: e.g. \"In the basket\", \"out of here\"\n3. Clausal TCU: e.g. \"When I am free\", \"If I got the job\"\n4. Sentential TCU: e.g. \"I am working on my thesis\", \"He has got my car\"\n\nA general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:\n1. Intonationally Complete: This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.\n2. Grammatically Complete: This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.\n3. Pragmatically Complete: This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance \"She is really\" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, \"That girl is really pretty!\", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.\n\nScholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.\n\nTransition Relevance Place (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.\n\nSacks H, Schegloff E A, Jefferson G. \"A simplest systematics for the organization of turn-taking for conversation.\" \"Language\" 50 (1974) pp. 696–735\n\n"}
{"id": "100824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100824", "title": "Uncial script", "text": "Uncial script\n\nUncial is a majuscule script (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes. Uncial letters were used to write Greek, Latin, and Gothic.\n\nEarly uncial script is likely to have developed from late Old Roman cursive. Early forms are characterized by broad single stroke letters using simple round forms taking advantage of the new parchment and vellum surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as papyrus. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of \"De bellis macedonicis\" in the British Library, of the late 1st-early 2nd century, all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.\n\nAs the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. Ascenders and descenders were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact minuscule scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the Bible, tapering off until around the 10th century. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script, by far the largest number prior to the Carolingian Renaissance.\n\nIn general, there are some common features of uncial script:\n\n\nIn later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in , , ) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.\n\nDue to its extremely widespread use, in Byzantine, African, Italian, French, Spanish, and \"insular\" (Irish, British and English) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:\n\n\nThere is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. \"Uncial\" itself probably comes from St. Jerome's preface to the Book of Job, where it is found in the form \"uncialibus\", but it is possible that this is a misreading of \"inicialibus\" (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.\n\nIn classical Latin \"uncialis\" could mean both \"inch-high\" and \"weighing an ounce\", and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of \"codex\", \"block of wood\".\n\nThe term \"uncial\" in the sense of describing this script was first used by Jean Mabillon in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by Scipione Maffei, who used to refer to this script as distinct from Roman square capitals.\n\nThe word, \"uncial\", is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:\n\nThe Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.\n\nFor further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo \"Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica\" (Florence, 1967).\n\nModern calligraphy usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more cursive scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.\n\nIn a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the blackletter typefaces for written German until well into the 20th century, Gaelic letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in Irish until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments and other 'official' uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is insular, not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called \"Byzantine lettering\" by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the Greek Orthodox Church and various institutions and individuals in Greece to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the Greek War of Independence. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the Greek military junta of 1967–74, when even Greek Drachma coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the Metapolitefsi, the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.\n\nThe term \"half-uncial\" or \"semi-uncial\" was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, \"Istoria diplomatica\" (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous \"Codex Basilicanus\" of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by René Prosper Tassin and Charles François Toustain. Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source. See now: L. E. Boyle, \"'Basilicanus' of Hilary Revisited,\" in \"Integral Palaeography\", with an introduction by F. Troncarelli (Turnhout, 2001), 105-17.\n\nLike uncial, half-uncial derived from Roman cursive, but now of a later, evolved type. It was first used around the 3rd century and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.\n\nSome general forms of half-uncial letters are:\n\nHalf-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and was then carried to England. There, it was used up to the 8th century, and developed into the insular script after the 8th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17652491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17652491", "title": "Vulgar Latin vocabulary", "text": "Vulgar Latin vocabulary\n\nThis article lists some vocabulary of Vulgar Latin.\n\nLike all languages, Latin possessed numerous synonyms that were associated with different speech registers. Some of these words were in the everyday language from the time of Old Latin, while others were borrowed late into Latin from other languages: Germanic, Gaulish, the Paleo-Balkan languages preceding Eastern Romance etc. Certain words customarily used in Classical Latin were not used in Vulgar Latin, such as \"equus\", \"horse\". Instead, Vulgar Latin typically featured \"caballus\" \"nag\" (but note Romanian \"iapă\", Sardinian \"èbba\", Spanish \"yegua\", Catalan \"euga\" and Portuguese \"égua\" all meaning \"mare\" and deriving from Classical \"equa\").\n\nThe differences applied even to the basic grammatical particles; many classical have no reflex in Romance, such as \"an, at, autem, dōnec, enim, ergō, etiam, haud, igitur, ita, nam, postquam, quidem, quīn, quod, quoque, sed, utrum\" and \"vel\". Verbs with prefixed prepositions frequently displaced simple forms. The number of words formed by such productive suffixes as \"-bilis\", \"-ārius\", \"-itāre\" and \"-icāre\" grew apace.\n\nSome Romance languages preserve Latin words that were lost in most others. For example, Italian \"ogni\" (\"each/every\") and Sardinian \"ondzi\" continue Latin \"omnes\". Elsewhere the gap is filled by reflexes of Greek κατά or evolved forms of \"tōtus\" (originally \"entire\") for a similar meaning; Occitan/Portuguese/Spanish \" cada\" 'each, every', \"tudo\"/\"todo\" in Portuguese, \"todo\" in Spanish, \"tot\" in Catalan, \"tout\" in French and \"tot\" in Romanian. The plural \"tutti\" in Italian means \"all, every\" and can overlap in meaning with \"ogni\" (\"ogni giorno\" and \"tutti i giorni\" both mean \"every day\"), and the singular \"tutto\" still means \"entire\" as well as \"all\".\n\nSometimes a Classical Latin word appears in a Romance language alongside the equivalent Vulgar Latin word: classical \"caput\", \"head\", and vulgar \"testa\" (originally \"pot\") in Italian, French and Catalan. In Romanian \"cap\" means 'head' in the anatomical sense, but \"țeastă\" means skull or carapace, while \"țest\" means \"pot\" or \"lid\". Some southern Italian dialects preserve \"capo\" as the normal word for \"head\". Spanish and Portuguese have \"cabeza\"/\"cabeça\", derived from *\"capetia\", a modified form of \"caput\", but in Portuguese \"testa\" is the word for \"forehead\".\n\nFrequently, words borrowed directly from literary Latin at some later date, rather than evolved within Vulgar Latin, are found side by side with the evolved form. The (lack of) expected phonological developments is a clue that one word has been borrowed. For example, Vulgar Latin \"fungus\", \"fungus, mushroom\", which became Italian \"fungo\", Catalan \"fong\", and Portuguese \"fungo\", became \"hongo\" in Spanish, showing the \"f\" > \"h\" shift that was common in early Spanish (cf. \"fīlius\" > Spanish \"hijo\", \"son\", \"facere\" > Spanish \"hacer\", \"to do\"). But Spanish also had \"fungo\", which by its lack of the expected sound shifts of /f/ and /u/ shows that it was borrowed directly from Latin.\n\nVulgar Latin contained a large number of words of foreign origin not present in literary texts. Many works on medicine were written and distributed in Greek, and words were often borrowed from these sources. For example, \"gamba\" ( 'knee joint' ), originally a veterinary term only, replaced the classical Latin word for leg (\"crus\") in most Romance languages. (cf. Fr. jambe, It. gamba). Cooking terms were also often borrowed from Greek sources; a calque based on a Greek term was \"ficatum (iecur)\" (goose's liver fattened with figs, see foie gras for more information), with the participle \"ficatum\" becoming the common word for liver in Vulgar Latin (cf. Sp. \"hígado\", Fr. \"foie\", It. \"fegato\", Pt \"fígado\", Romanian \"ficat\"). Important religious terms were also drawn from religious texts written in Greek, such as \"episcopus\" (bishop), \"presbyter\" (priest), \"martyr\" etc. Words borrowed from Gaulish include \"caballus\" (horse) and \"carrus\" (chariot).\n"}
{"id": "16908902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16908902", "title": "Writing in space", "text": "Writing in space\n\nSeveral instruments have been used to write in outer space, including different types of pencils and pens. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions.\n\nA common urban legend states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the conditions experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was developed independently by a private organization in the 1960s.\n\nSpace versus ground recordkeeping presents several serious issues:\n\nAs with submarines before them, space capsules are closed environments, subject to strict contamination requirements. Incoming material is screened for mission threats. Any shedding, including wood, graphite, and ink vapors and droplets, may become a risk. In the case of a manned capsule, the much smaller recirculating volume, combined with microgravity and an even greater difficulty of resupply, make these requirements even more critical.\n\nRelease of wood shavings, graphite dust, broken graphite tips, and ink compounds are a dangerous flight hazard. Lack of gravity makes objects drift, even with air filtration. Any conductive material is a threat to electronics, including the electromechanical switches in use during early manned space programs. Nonconductive particles may also hamper switch contacts, such as normally-open and rotary mechanisms. Drifting particles are a threat to the eyes (and to a lesser extent an inhalation threat), which may risk execution of a critical procedure. Personnel may don protective gear, but both ground and flight crews are more comfortable and more productive \"in shirtsleeves\". Paul C. Fisher of Fisher Pen Company recounts that pencils were 'too dangerous to use in space'.\n\nEven before the Apollo 1 fire, the CM crew cabin was reviewed for hazardous materials such as paper, velcro, and even low-temperature plastics. A directive was issued but poorly enforced. When combined with high oxygen content, the Apollo 1 cabin burned within seconds, killing all three crew members.\n\nCosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev flew with Space Pens starting in the '80s and states \"pencil lead breaks...and is not good in space capsule; very dangerous to have metal lead particles in zero gravity\".\n\nStrict documentation requirements accompany anything as complex as a large-scale aerospace demonstration, let alone a manned spaceflight. Quality assurance records document individual parts, and instances of procedures, for deviances. Low production and flight rates generally result in high variance; most spacecraft designs (to say nothing of individual spacecraft) fly so infrequently that they are considered experimental aircraft. When combined with the stringent weight drivers of orbital and deep-space flight, the quality-control demands are high. Change control records track the evolution of hardware and procedures from their ground testing, initial flights, through necessary corrections and midlife revision and upgrades, and on to retention of engineering knowledge for later programs, and any incident investigations.\n\nWhen the flight also has scientific or engineering science objectives, low-quality data may affect mission success directly.\n\nFaced with these requirements, pencils or other non-permanent recordkeeping methods are unsatisfactory. The act of taking permanent, high-integrity documentation itself deters kludges, workarounds, and \"go fever\". The Apollo 1 investigation uncovered procedural and workmanship deficiencies in multiple areas, up to procedures on the pad.\n\nAt sea level, temperature is moderated by the thick atmosphere. As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically. Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, to decrease the stresses (and thus, mass) of their capsules. Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times. Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures. While the Soyuz spacecraft had a design pressure, and could use its orbital module as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned lunar missions. In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental depressurizations), provide a margin, and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.\n\nThe wood pencil has been used for writing by NASA and Soviet space programs from the start. It is simple with no moving parts, except for the sharpener. However, wood, graphite, and rubber (in the eraser) are all combustible and create dust. Graphite, in particular, both burns and produces dust that conducts electricity.\n\nThe mechanical pencil has been used by NASA starting in the 1960s Gemini program. It can be made to be as wide as the width of astronauts' gloves, yet maintain its light weight. There are no wooden components which might catch fire and create dust. However, the pencil lead still creates graphite dust that conducts electricity.\n\nGrease pencils on plastic slates were used by the Soviet space program as an early substitute for wood pencils. It is simple with no moving parts. The paper shroud is peeled back when needed. The disadvantage is that the paper wrapper has to be disposed of. Writing done with the grease pencil is also not as durable as ink on paper.\n\nBallpoint pens have been used by Soviet and then Russian space programs as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with graphite pencils and grease pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to outgassing and temperature variations.\n\nFelt-tip pens were used by NASA astronauts in the Apollo missions. However, wick-based instruments are designed around low viscosity, and thus operating temperature and pressure.\n\nThe Fisher Space Pen is a gas-charged ball point pen that is rugged and works in a wider variety of conditions, such as zero gravity, vacuum and extreme temperatures. Its thixotropic ink and vent-free cartridge release no significant vapor at common temperatures and low pressures. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), and it functions at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m) and at temperatures from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). However, it is more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives. It has been used by both NASA and Soviet/Russian astronauts on Apollo, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS missions.\n\n"}
