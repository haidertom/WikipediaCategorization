The '''Apollonian and Dionysian''' is a [[philosophical]] and literary [[concept]], or also a [[dichotomy]], based on [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]] in [[Greek mythology]].  Some [[Western culture|Western]] philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and later followers.  

In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both [[son of God|sons]] of [[Zeus]]. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.  Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.

==Nietzsche's version==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Although the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the terms were used before him in [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Del Caro, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709799 Dionysian Classicism, or Nietzsche's Appropriation of an Aesthetic Norm]", in ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', Vol. 50, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1989), pp. 589–605 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them, while [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, [[Rudolf Steiner]] treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Satyrs and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men LACMA 50.9.43.jpg|thumb|230px|Attic Black-Figure Lekythos with (Body) Dionysos between Maenads and Sileni and (Shoulder) a Seated Man between Women and Men]]

Nietzsche's [[aesthetic]] usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian "''Kunsttriebe''" ("artistic impulses") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. [[Nietzsche]] is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]] that tragedy begins its downfall ("''Untergang''"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the [[dialectic]]) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.

To further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the [[Socratic method|Socratic Dialectic]] as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for "higher" ideals. Nietzsche claims in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life.  Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. 
&lt;!-- As above, these two principles can only be described by provisional estimations and whatever Nietzsche states ought to mime that chord scrupulously, but these contrasts/notations might make it quite familiar to the reader wherewith their meaning can be adduced. Furthermore, something will have to be mentioned about the Greeks ''et cetera'' below in this section of the article; therefore, I have added a "section-stub" here. Consequently, other parts of this article will most likely require a slight alteration as well and additional evenhandedness, for this is a much debated topic. --&gt;

The interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in ''The Birth of Tragedy'', from their use in [[Greek tragedy]]: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the "Primordial Unity", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was "...burdened with all the errors of youth" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.

Different from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.

==Other viewpoints==
===Post-modern reading===
Nietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of ''fragmented consciousness'' or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeNOhsRjzrcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Michel+Foucault+Apollonian+and+Dionysian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N5jHLWLXKP&amp;sig=tBkq0FoIuszQzCyAvLlF0aJUNcc&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dEJ4ULm3N8jxsga8jYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Michel%20Foucault%20Apollonian%20and%20Dionysian&amp;f=false|title=The Postmodernism Reader|first=Drolet |last=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the re-reading of modernity By Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Manchester University Press,1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-3745-0}} p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Sloterdijk]], the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other.&lt;ref&gt;Thinker on Stage: Nietzsche's Materialism, translation by Jamie Owen Daniel; foreword by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8166-1765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth being ''primordial pain'', our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.

Extending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Femininity and Masculinity in City-Form: Philosophical Urbanism as a History of Consciousness|journal=Human Studies|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=29|issue=2|pages=229–256|doi= 10.1007/s10746-006-9019-4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9337128m117q48k2/|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruth Benedict===
Anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the [[Zuñi people]] as opposed to the Dionysian [[Kwakiutl|Kwakiutl people]].&lt;ref&gt;BENEDICT, R. (1932), CONFIGURATIONS OF CULTURE IN NORTH AMERICA. American Anthropologist, 34: 1–27. doi: 10.1525/aa.1932.34.1.02a00020&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work ''[[Patterns of Culture]]''.

===Albert Szent-Györgyi===
[[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who wrote that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szent-Györgyi|first=Albert|date=1972-06-02|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/176/4038/966.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=176|issue=4038|pages=966–966|doi=10.1126/science.176.4038.966|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17778411}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge", Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Camille Paglia===
American humanities scholar [[Camille Paglia]] writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller ''[[Sexual Personae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1990). ''[[Sexual Personae|Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]],'' New York: Vintage Books.{{isbn missing|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.

The Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and [[chthonic]] (she prefers ''Chthonic'' to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with [[hedonism]] and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that "the Dionysian is no picnic."). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: "Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: "The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and the older [[limbic]] and reptilian brains."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of &amp;ndash; or combat with &amp;ndash; Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: "The male orientation of [[classical Athens]] was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;Paglia (1990), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">The phrase '''man bites dog''' is a shortened version of an [[aphorism]] in [[journalism]] which describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a [[dog bite|dog biting a man]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ Owen Spencer-Thomas  ''News Values''. Accessed October 15, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, "You never read about a plane that did not crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06257/721583-152.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=There's news in planes that don't crash | date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was coined by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', 16th edition, ed.

A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 Years, 1690 to 1940]''&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is also attributed to [[Charles Anderson Dana]] (1819–1897).&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of the Civil War By Charles Anderson Dana, Charles E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42349">In [[economics]], utility is the satisfaction or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the '''marginal utility''' of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] is the change in the utility from an increase in the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of that good or service. 

In the context of [[cardinal utility]], economists sometimes speak of a '''law of diminishing marginal utility''', meaning that the first [[units of measurement|unit]] of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:
:MU&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;......&gt;MU&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

== Marginality ==
The term ''marginal'' refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As [[Philip Wicksteed]] explained the term,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowment]], meaning the total resources available for consumption (see [[Budget constraint]]). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.

For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]]. Under this assumption, [[marginal concepts]], including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of [[differential calculus]]. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.

In practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.

== Utility ==
{{Main|Utility}}
Depending on which theory of ''utility'' is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were ''quantifiable'', that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Development of Utility Theory'', I and II, ''Journal of Political Economy'' (1950), issues 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Stigler|Stigler, George Joseph]]; ''The Adoption of Marginal Utility Theory'', ''History of Political Economy'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.

Contemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully ''proxied'' by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and ''defines'' "utility" as such a quantification.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Kreps|Kreps, David Marc]]; ''A Course in Microeconomic Theory'', Chapter two: ''The theory of consumer choice and demand'', ''Utility representations''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conception is [[Utilitarianism|Benthamite philosophy]], which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]]; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter I §I–III.&lt;/ref&gt; assumed subject to arithmetic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Jeremy; ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt; British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of [[John Stuart Mill]]), viewed utility as "the feelings of pleasure and pain"&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; “Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”, ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' v29 (June 1866) §2.&lt;/ref&gt; and further as a "''quantity'' of feeling" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, William Stanley; ''Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy'', ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'' v29 (June 1866) §4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.
For example, the [[Austrian school]] generally attributes value to ''the satisfaction of wants'',&lt;ref&gt;Menger, Carl; ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre'' (''Principles of Economics'') Chapter 2 §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; ''Utility'', ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes rejects even the ''possibility'' of quantification.&lt;ref name="mises" &gt;[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig Heinrich]]; ''Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

In any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Herbert Joseph; ''The Economics of Enterprise'' (1913) Ch VII, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the "law of diminishing marginal utility" (and is also known as [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen|Gossen]]'s [[Gossen's laws|First Law]]). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. "The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including [[time preference]] and the [[Value (economics)|value of goods]] ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility."&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt;

In modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time  is modeled via [[ordinal utility]], in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility ''is'' meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of [[cardinal utility]], which in modern economics is used in analyzing [[intertemporal choice]], [[expected utility hypothesis|choice under uncertainty]], and [[social welfare function|social welfare]].

The law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of [[diminishing returns]] which states that as the amount of one [[Factors of production|factor of production]] increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.

As the rate of commodity acquisition increases, ''marginal'' utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to '''zero''', reaching '''maximum''' total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become '''negative'''; this signifies '''dissatisfaction'''. For example,
* beyond some point, further doses of antibiotics would kill no pathogens at all, and might even become harmful to the body.
* to satiate thirst a person drinks water but beyond a point, consumption of more water might make the person vomit, hence leading to negative marginal and thus diminished total utility
* it takes a certain amount of food energy to sustain a population, yet beyond a point, more calories cannot be consumed and are simply discarded (or cause disease).

Diminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be ''increasing'' as well. For example:
* bed sheets, which up to some number may only provide warmth, but after that point may be useful to allow one to effect an escape by being tied together into a rope;
* tickets, for travel or theatre, where a second ticket might allow one to take a date on an otherwise uninteresting outing;
* dosages of antibiotics, where having too few pills would leave bacteria with greater resistance, but a full supply could effect a cure.
* the third leg is more useful than the first two when building a chair.

As suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the "tipping point" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple "yes" or "no" decision.

== Marginalist theory ==
[[Marginalism]] explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.

=== Market price and diminishing marginal utility ===
If an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.

In an economy with [[money]], the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining [[supply and demand]], as well as essential aspects of models of [[imperfect competition]].

==== The paradox of water and diamonds ====
{{Main|Paradox of value}}
The "paradox of water and diamonds", usually most commonly associated with [[Adam Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam; ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Chapter IV. "Of the Origin and Use of Money"&lt;/ref&gt; though recognized by earlier thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Scott|last = Gordon|year = 1991|title = History and Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction|chapter = The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century|publisher = [[Routledge]]|isbn = 0-415-09670-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.

Price is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the "paradox" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.

That is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.

== Quantified marginal utility ==
Under the [[special case]] in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=U(S_2)-U(S_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are distinguishable by values of just one variable &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt; to the size of that change:
[[Image:UtilityQuantified.svg|thumb|right|400px|Diminishing marginal utility, given quantification]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
(where “[[ceteris paribus|c.p.]]” indicates that the ''only'' [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] to change is &lt;math&gt;g\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Mainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta g\to 0} \left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;
exists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the [[partial derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial g}=\lim_{\Delta g\to 0}\left.\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta g}\right|_{c.p.}&lt;/math&gt;.
Accordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial g^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

== History ==
The concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price.  The term “marginal utility”, credited to the [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich von Wieser]] by [[Alfred Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred; ''Principles of Economics'',  3 Ch 3 Note.&lt;/ref&gt; was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (''border-use'').&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser,  Friedrich; ''Über  den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and  Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p.  128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="wieser_zwei"&gt;Wieser, Friedrich von; ''Der natürliche Werth''  &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Natural Value''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1889), Bk I Ch V  “Marginal Utility” ([http://praxeology.net/FW-NV-I-5.htm HTML]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-marginalist approaches ===
Perhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], wherein he writes {{Quotation|external goods have a limit, like any other instrument, and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'', Bk 7 Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soudek |first=Josef |title=Aristotle's Theory of Exchange: An Inquiry into the Origin of Economic Analysis |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=96 |issue=1 |year=1952 |pages=45–75 |jstor=3143742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kauder"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kauder |first=Emil |title=Genesis of the Marginal Utility Theory from Aristotle to the End of the Eighteenth Century |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=63 |issue=251 |year=1953 |pages=638–50 |jstor=2226451 |doi=10.2307/2226451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Barry Lewis John |title=Aristotle and the Development of Value Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=115–28 |year=1964 |jstor=1880547 |doi=10.2307/1880547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schumArist"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Part II Chapter 1 §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, Scott; ''Aristoteles' Economic Thought'' (1995) Chapters 1, 2, &amp; 6.&lt;/ref&gt;)

A great variety of economists have concluded that there is ''some'' sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Přibram|Přibram, Karl]]; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth-century Italian [[Mercantilism|mercantilists]], such as [[Antonio Genovesi]], [[Giammaria Ortes]], [[Pietro Verri]], [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marchese Cesare di Beccaria]], and [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli]], held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted.&lt;ref name="pribramItalMerc"&gt;Pribram, Karl; ''A History of Economic Reasoning'' (1983), Chapter 5 “Refined Mercantilism”, “Italian Mercantilists”.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Della moneta'' (1751), Abbé [[Ferdinando Galiani]], a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, ''utility'' and ''scarcity'', with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.
[[Image:Richard Whately.jpg|thumb|right|105px|Richard Whately]]
[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]], in ''Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse'' (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.

Like the Italian mercantists, [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac]], saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity.  In ''De commerce et le gouvernement'' (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.

This last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, [[Richard Whately]], who in ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy'' (1832) wrote {{Quotation|It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; ''Introductory Lectures on Political Economy, Being part of a course delivered in the Easter term'' (1832).&lt;/ref&gt;}} (Whatley's student [[Nassau William Senior|Senior]] is noted below as an early marginalist.)

=== Marginalists before the Revolution ===
[[Image:Gabriel Cramer.jpg|thumb|105px|Gabriel Cramer]]

The first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis” in ''Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae'' 5 (1738); reprinted in translation as “Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk” in ''Econometrica'' 22 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Daniel; letter of 4 July 1731 to Nicolas Bernoulli ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernoulli, Nicolas; letter of 5 April 1732, acknowledging receipt of “Specimen theoriae novae metiendi sortem pecuniariam” ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1728, [[Gabriel Cramer]] had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Garbriel; letter of 21 May 1728 to [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicolaus Bernoulli]] ([http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf#search=%22Nicolas%20Bernoulli%22 excerpted in PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909221757/http://www.cs.xu.edu/math/Sources/Montmort/stpetersburg.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Each had sought to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]], and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the [[natural logarithm]] (Bernoulli) or [[square root]] (Cramer) thereof.  However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.

In [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/lloyd/value “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”], delivered in 1833 and included in ''Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent'' (1837), [[William Forster Lloyd]] explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications.  The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman |last=Seligman |first=E. R. A. |title=On Some Neglected British Economists |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=13 |issue=51 |pages=335–63 |year=1903 |jstor=2221519 |doi=10.2307/2221519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''An Outline of the Science of Political Economy'' (1836), [[Nassau William Senior]] asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Michael V. |title=Diamonds Are Forever(?): Nassau Senior and Utility Theory |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=60 |year=1992 |issue=1 |pages=64–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1992.tb00211.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), [[Jules Dupuit]] applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dupuit |first=Jules |title=De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics |journal=Annales des ponts et chaussées |series=Second series |volume=8 |year=1844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] published ''Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln'', which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy.  However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.

=== The Marginal Revolution ===
Marginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] in England, [[Carl Menger|Menger]] in Austria, and [[Léon Walras|Walras]] in Switzerland.
[[Image:Jevons.jpeg|thumb|105px|William Stanley Jevons]]
[[William Stanley Jevons]] first proposed the theory in [http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/jevons/mathem.txt “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy”] ([http://www.eco.utexas.edu/~hmcleave/jevonsmath.pdf PDF]), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book ''The Theory of Political Economy'' in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and of [[John Stuart Mill]], but he differed from his [[classical economics|classical]] predecessors in emphasizing that "value depends entirely upon utility", in particular, on "final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn."&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1871), ''The Theory of Political Economy'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of "final degrees of utility," but also to costs of production.&lt;ref&gt;W. Stanley Jevons (1879, 2nd ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=jevons+%22the+theory+of+political+economy%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IyxPG-thjm&amp;sig=ta6Vv6bIPxNZVaqyxFoGfv39Od8#PPA203,M1 ''The Theory of Political Economy''], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Brown (1987), "Jevons, William Stanley," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 2, pp. 1008–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Menger]] presented the theory in [http://docs.mises.de/Menger/Menger_Grundsaetze.pdf ''Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre''] (translated as [https://www.mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp ''Principles of Economics'']) in 1871.  Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points.  First, he took special pains to explain ''why'' individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the [[Austrian School]]” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen" /&gt; (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published ''Grundsätze''.&lt;ref&gt;Kauder, Emil; ''A History of Marginal Utility Theory'' (1965), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;) Menger also developed the [[law of diminishing marginal utility]].&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Polleit, Thorsten (2011-02-11) [https://mises.org/daily/5014/What-Can-the-Law-of-Diminishing-Marginal-Utility-Teach-Us What Can the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Teach Us?], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.

[[Léon Walras|Marie-Esprit-Léon Walras]] introduced the theory in ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'', the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition.  Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] and [[Enrico Barone|Barone]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker  (1987), "Walras, Léon" ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, p. 862.&lt;/ref&gt;

An American, [[John Bates Clark]], is sometimes also mentioned.  But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics.  Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.

==== The second generation ====
[[Image:Vilfredo Pareto 1870s2.jpg|thumb|105px|Vilfredo Pareto]]
Although the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists.  In England, the second generation were exemplified by [[Philip Wicksteed|Philip Henry Wicksteed]], by [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]], and by [[Alfred Marshall]]; in Austria by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and by [[Friedrich von Wieser]]; in Switzerland by [[Vilfredo Pareto]]; and in America by [[Herbert Joseph Davenport]] and by [[Frank Fetter|Frank A. Fetter]].

There were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines.  The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras.  Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger.  Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.)  William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Joseph T. 1999; “The Place of Mises’s Human Action in the Development of Modern Economic Thought.” ''Quarterly Journal of Economic Thought'' v. 2 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Böhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception.&lt;ref name="salerno" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von. “Grundzüge der Theorie des wirtschaftlichen Güterwerthes”, ''Jahrbüche für Nationalökonomie und Statistik'' v 13 (1886).  Translated as ''Basic Principles of Economic Value''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing [[marginal product]]ivity of time and with [[time preference]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von; ''Kapital Und Kapitalizns. Zweite Abteilung: Positive Theorie des Kapitales'' (1889). Translated as ''Capital and Interest. II: Positive Theory of Capital'' with appendices rendered as ''Further Essays on Capital and Interest''.&lt;/ref&gt; (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by [[Knut Wicksell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wicksell, Johan Gustaf Knut; ''Über Wert, Kapital unde Rente'' (1893). Translated as [https://www.mises.org/books/valuecapital.pdf ''Value, Capital and Rent''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival [[Irving Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Irving; ''Theory of Interest'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;)

Marshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his ''Principles of Economics'', the first volume of which was published in 1890.  Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so).  Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more [[Classical economics|classical]] manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined.  (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.&lt;ref name="schumMarshScis"&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph Alois; ''History of Economic Analysis'' (1954) Pt IV Ch 6 §4.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==== The Marginal Revolution and Marxism ====
[[Karl Marx]] acknowledged that "nothing can have value, without being an object of utility",&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; ''Capital'' V1 Ch 1 §1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl Heinrich; [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/f239-289.htm ''Grundrisse''] (completed in 1857 though not published until much later)&lt;/ref&gt; but, in his analysis, "use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl Heinrich]]: ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''] (1859), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.

The doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to [[Marxism|Marxist economics]]. However the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] or [[William Warren Bartley|Bartley]] has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the [[British Museum]], may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of ''Kapital'' before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, Friedrich August von, with [[William Warren Bartley|William Warren Bartley III]]; ''The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism'' (1988) p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, ''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems'' (1896),&lt;ref&gt;Böhm-Bawerk, Eugen Ritter von: "''Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems''" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;"On the Closure of the Marxist System"&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für [[Karl Knies|K. Knies]]'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first was Wicksteed's "The Marxian Theory of Value. ''Das Kapital'': a criticism" (1884,&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "Das Kapital: A Criticism", ''To-day'' 2 (1884) pp. 388–409.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" in 1885&lt;ref&gt;Wicksteed, Philip Henry; "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder", ''To-day'' 3 (1885) pp. 177–79.&lt;/ref&gt;). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were [[Rudolf Hilferding]]'s ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904)&lt;ref&gt;Hilferding, Rudolf: ''Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik'' (1904). Translated as ''Böhm-Bawerk's Criticism of Marx''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Politicheskoy ekonomni rante'' (1914) by [[Nikolai Bukharin|Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Буха́рин, Никола́й Ива́нович (Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin)]]; ''Политической экономии рантье'' (1914). Translated as [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1927/leisure-economics/ ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class''].&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist [[Piero Sraffa]] providing an important critique of marginalism.

It might also be noted that some followers of [[Henry George]] similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mason Gaffney|Gaffney, Mason]], and Fred Harrison: ''The Corruption of Economics'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Roemer]] and other [[Analytical Marxism#Exploitation|analytical Marxists]] have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.

=== Reformulation ===
In his 1881 work [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/edgeworth/mathpsychics.pdf ''Mathematical Psychics''], [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] presented the [[indifference curve]], deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.

In 1915, [[Eugen Slutsky]] derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Slutsky|Слуцкий, Евгений Евгениевич (Slutsky, Yevgyeniy Ye.)]]; "Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore", ''Giornale degli Economisti'' 51 (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of [[World War I|the World War]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by [[John Hicks|John Richard Hicks]] and [[R. G. D. Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, John Richard, and Roy George Douglas Allen; "A Reconsideration of the Theory of Value", ''Economica'' 54 (1934).&lt;/ref&gt; derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)

Although some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility,&lt;ref name="mises" /&gt; most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a "rabbit out of a hat"&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. 2"Utility and Preference" §8, p. 23 in the 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;) about decreasing marginal rates of substitution&lt;ref name="hicks_vc"&gt;Hicks, Sir John Richard; ''Value and Capital'', Chapter I. "Utility and Preference" §7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.

For those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but "old fashioned" and observationally unnecessary.&lt;ref name="hicks_vc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samuelson"&gt;Samuelson, Paul Anthony; "Complementarity: An Essay on the 40th Anniversary of the Hicks-Allen Revolution in Demand Theory", ''Journal of Economic Literature'' vol 12 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival ===
[[Image:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|105px|[[John von Neumann]]]]
When Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address [[St. Petersburg paradox|a paradox of gambling]], rather than the [[paradox of value]].  The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither [[risk]] nor [[uncertainty]].  So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.

The [[expected utility hypothesis]] of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Frank Plumpton; "Truth and Probability" ([http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf  PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227205205/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het//texts/ramsey/ramsess.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}), Chapter VII in ''The Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays'' (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1944),&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John and Oskar Morgenstern; ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Leonard Jimmie: ''Foundations of Statistics'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.

A major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Peter, and Michael Rothschild, eds.: ''Uncertainty in Economics'' (1989). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies [[risk aversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Demange, Gabriel, and Guy Laroque: ''Finance and the Economics of Uncertainty'' (2006), Ch. 3, pp. 71–72. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of [[Prudence#Prudence in economics and finance|prudence]], which means [[convex function|convex]] marginal utility.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Miles (1990), "Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large", ''[[Econometrica]]'', 58 (1) pp. 53–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H. Heinemann 1944).&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Laurence R |year=2001 |title=A NATURAL HISTORY OF NEGATION |url=http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-natural-history-of-negation-Laurence-R.-Horn.pdf |location=Stanford University |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1 |publisher=CLSI Publications |isbn=1-57586-336-7  |accessdate=29 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Negative free bid''' is a [[contract bridge]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#treatment|treatment]] whereby a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#freebid|free bid]] by responder over an opponent's overcall shows a long suit in a weak hand and is not forcing. This is in contrast with standard treatment, where a free bid can show unlimited values and is unconditionally forcing. The treatment is a relatively recent invention, and has become quite popular, especially in expert circles.

Negative free bids resolve relatively frequent situations where the responder holds a long suit with which he would like to compete for a partscore, but is deprived from bidding it by opponent's overcall.

==Example==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|||1{{diams}}||1{{spades}}||?
|} 
For example, if South holds:&amp;nbsp;{{BridgeHandInline|86|KJ10852|K6|532}}, partner opens 1{{Diams}} and East overcalls 1{{Spades}}, he couldn't bid 2{{Hearts}} in standard methods, as it would show 10+ [[Hand evaluation|high-card points]], and a [[negative double]] would be too off-shape. With NFB treatment in effect though, he can bid 2{{Hearts}} which the partner may pass (unless he has extra values and support, or an excellent suit of its own without tolerance for hearts).
{{clear}}
However, as a [[corollary]], negative free bids affect the scope of negative double; if the hand is suitable for "standard" forcing free bid (10-11+ points), a negative double has to be made first and the suit bid only in the next round. Thus, the negative double can be made with the following types of hand:
*A weakish hand with unbid suits (unbid major)
*A stronger hand with unbid suits
*A strong (opening bid or more) one-suited hand.
This can sometimes allow the opponents to [[preempt]] effectively. 
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|1{{Diams}}||1{{Hearts}}||Dbl||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=center
|?|| || ||
|} 
For example, West, holding: {{BridgeHandInline|KJ103|J8|AKQ104|J2}}, after this auction is in an awkward situation — he doesn't know whether partner has spades or not; whether South was bidding to make or to [[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]] — is it correct to double, bid 4{{Spades}} or pass?

If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The device may also have [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency.&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, &lt;math&gt;Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N&lt;/math&gt;, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, &lt;math&gt;Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;R_N\,&lt;\,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; and the device will amplify.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;

Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region.

*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

These have negative differential resistance ''(&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; region)'' and produce power ''(grey region)''. Applying a large enough voltage or current of either polarity to the port moves the device into its nonlinear region where saturation of the amplifier causes the differential resistance to become positive ''('''black''' portion of curve)'', and above the supply voltage rails &lt;math&gt;\pm V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; the static resistance becomes positive and the device consumes power.

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],
*the amount of negative resistance can be varied by adjusting the [[loop gain]],
*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

A common example of an "active resistance" circuit is the [[negative impedance converter]] (NIC)&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linvill"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

*'''Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator:''' Since VCNR ("N" type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than ''r'',&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt; the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source ''V''&lt;sub&gt;bias&lt;/sub&gt; to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and [[RLC circuit|parallel resonant circuit]] load ''LC''. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K. Kurokawa.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurokawa"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complex impedance]] of the negative resistance part &lt;math&gt;Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on frequency ''ω'' but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current ''I''; while the resonator part &lt;math&gt;Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; is linear, depending only on frequency.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt; The circuit equation is &lt;math&gt;(Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; so it will only oscillate (have nonzero ''I'') at the frequency ''ω'' and amplitude ''I'' for which the total impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_N + Z_L \,&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
[[File:Negative resistance oscillator block diagram.svg|300px|right]]

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. [[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an [[LC circuit]] across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Duddell's "[[William Duddell|singing arc]]" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; However, in 1903 Danish engineers [[Valdemar Poulsen]] and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Valdemar |last=Poulsen |title=System for producing continuous electric oscillations |booktitle=Transactions of the International Electrical Congress, St. Louis, 1904, Vol. 2 |pages=963–971 |publisher=J.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed.

Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M.

Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution. This theory is a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Induction: From Kolmogorov and Solomonoff to De Finetti and Back to Kolmogorov JJ McCall – Metroeconomica, 2004 – Wiley Online Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.

Another technical approach to Occam's razor is [[Ontological commitment#Ontological parsimony|ontological parsimony]].&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;
{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Alan |title=Simplicity |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/simplicity/#OntPar |date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsimony means spareness and is also referred to as the Rule of Simplicity. This is considered a strong version of Occam's razor.&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|title=What is Occam's Razor?|website=math.ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706234202/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html|archivedate=6 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Everywhere The Soles of Your Feet Shall Tread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shdlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 |author=Stormy Dawn |date=17 July 2017 |isbn=9781480838024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation used in medicine is called the "[[Zebra (medicine)|Zebra]]": a doctor should reject an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely, derived from [[Theodore Woodward]]'s dictum "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sotos |first=John G. |year=2006 |origyear=1991 |title=Zebra Cards: An Aid to Obscure Diagnoses |location=Mt. Vernon, VA |publisher=Mt. Vernon Book Systems |isbn=978-0-9818193-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David M. Boulton; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 11, Issue 2, 1968 Page(s):185–194, "An information measure for classification."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David L. Dowe; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 4, Sep 1999 Page(s):270–283, "Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a connection between Occam's razor and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|title=A short introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length|last=Nannen|first=Volker|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602044851/http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

The '''one-electron universe''' postulate, proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in a telephone call to [[Richard Feynman]] in the spring of 1940, hypothesises that all [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. According to Feynman:

{{cquote|I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"&lt;ref name=Feynman1965&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html | title= Nobel Lecture |date= 11 December 1965 | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|author=Richard Feynman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
The idea is based on the [[world line]]s traced out across [[spacetime]] by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment.

At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the [[antiparticle]] to the electron, the positron.

Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;

Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech:

{{cquote|I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from [Wheeler] as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole!&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;}}

Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper "The Theory of Positrons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=6 |date=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749–759|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |date=1950|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N |doi=10.1143/PTP.5.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
In what follows we will be making use of the following notation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_T(x(T))= \frac{\partial \Psi(x)}{\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_x(x(T))=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H_x(x^*,u^*,\lambda^*,t)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp;
\ldots &amp; \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Positive and Negative Affect Schedule''' ('''PANAS''') is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both [[Positive affectivity|positive]] and [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]]. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 ''(not at all)'' to 5 ''(very much)''. The measure has been used mainly as a research tool in group studies, but can be utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=John R.|last2=Henry|first2=Julie D.|title=The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Construct validity, measurement properties and normative data in a large non-clinical sample|url=http://doi.crossref.org/10.1348/0144665031752934|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=245–265|doi=10.1348/0144665031752934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened, elongated, and children's versions of the PANAS have been developed, taking approximately 5–10 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clinical and non-clinical studies have found the PANAS to be a reliable and valid instrument in the assessment of positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Clark|first2=Lee A.|last3=Tellegen|first3=Auke|title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and history ==
The PANAS was developed in 1988 by researchers from the University of Minnesota and Southern Methodist University. Previous mood measures have shown correlations of variable strength between positive and negative affect, and these same measures have questionable reliability and validity. Watson, Clark, and Tellegen developed the PANAS in an attempt to provide a better, purer measure of each of these dimensions.

The researchers extracted 60 terms from the factor analyses of Michael Zevon and Tellegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zevon|first=Michael A.|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke|date=1982-07-01|title=The structure of mood change: An idiographic/nomothetic analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/43/1/111|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=43|issue=1|pages=111–122|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.111|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown to be relatively accurate markers of either positive or negative affect, but not both. They chose terms that met a strong correlation to one corresponding dimension but exhibited a weak correlation to the other. Through multiple rounds of elimination and preliminary analyses with a test population, the researchers arrived at 10 terms for each of the two scales, as follows:

== Versions ==

===PANAS-C===
The '''PANAS for Children (PANAS-C)''' was developed in an attempt to differentiate the affective expressions of anxiety and depression in children. The tripartite model on which this measure is based suggests that high levels of negative affect is present in those with anxiety and depression, but high levels of positive affect is not shared between the two. Previous mood scales for children have been shown to reliably capture the former relationship but not the latter; the PANAS-C was created as a tool with better discriminant validity for child assessment. Similar to the development of the original PANAS, the PANAS-C drew from terms of the PANAS-X and eliminated several terms with insufficient correlations between the term and the affective construct after preliminary analyses with a non-clinical sample of children. The final version of the measure consists of 27 items: 12 positive affect terms and 15 negative affect terms. Despite the purpose of its development, however, the measure’s discriminant validity is still wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alicia A.|last2=Kendall|first2=Philip C.|date=2009-01-14|title=Psychometric Properties of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) in Children with Anxiety Disorders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=343–352|doi=10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-SF===
The '''PANAS-SF''',  comprises 10 items that were determined through the highest factor loadings on the exploratory [[factor analysis]] reported by Watson et al. (1988) in his original PANAS. Previous mood scales, such that of Bradburn, had low reliabilities and high correlations between subscales. Watson was able to address these concerns in his study of the original PANAS; however, his participants consisted mostly of student populations. The purpose of the PANAS-SF was not only to provide a shorter and more concise form of the PANAS, but to be able to apply the schedules to older clinical populations. Overall, it was reported that this modified model was consistent with Watson’s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kercher|first=Kyle|date=1992-06-01|title=Assessing Subjective Well-Being in the Old-Old The PANAS as a Measure of Orthogonal Dimensions of Positive and Negative Affect|url=http://roa.sagepub.com/content/14/2/131|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131–168|doi=10.1177/0164027592142001|issn=0164-0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-PANAS-SF===
Separate from the PANAS-SF,  Edmund Thompson created the international PANAS short form ('''I-PANAS-SF''') in order to make a 10 item mood scale that can be implemented effectively on an international level, provide more clarity on the content of the items, reduce ambiguities, address the limitations of the original and the previous short form of the PANAS, and also to provide a shorter, yet dependable and valid scale. To determine the 10 items of the 20 original items, two focus groups were utilized to evaluate all of the original 20 PANAS items. They found that while some items were easily understood by the participant, certains items had different meanings or were too ambiguous. Items that had too much ambiguity were eliminated from the modified form. Researchers found that the I-PANAS-SF had high correlations with the original PANAS. Through multiple tests and studies, they were able to determine that the I-PANAS-SF was on par with the original scale and can be used as a reliable, valid, brief, and efficient instrument on an international scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Edmund R.|date=2007-03-01|title=Development and Validation of an Internationally Reliable Short-Form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/38/2/227|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-X===
In 1994, Watson and Clark developed an expanded form of the PANAS, called the '''PANAS-X''', that consists of 60 items that can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The PANAS-X incorporates the original, higher order dimensions specified in the PANAS in addition to the measures of 11 lower order emotional states. These measures are broken down into three main categories: basic negative emotion scales consisting of fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness; basic positive emotion scales consisting of joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness; and other affective states consisting of shyness, fatigue, serenity, and surprise. Through extensive analyses, all eleven affective states, with the exception of surprise, were shown to be stable, valid measures that assess how an individual’s emotional states fluctuate over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Watson,|last2=Anna|first2=Clark, Lee|date=1999-01-01|title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Many forms of the PANAS (PANAS-C, PANAS-X, I-PANAS-SF, and among others) have shown that the PANAS has been widely employed. Recent studies have also shown that the PANAS can be administered in a large general adult population, as well as other populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to date, the PANAS is mostly used as a research tool in group studies, but it has the potential to be utilized in clinical work with individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the PANAS has the potential to be used to evaluate mental illnesses, as shown in an experiment conducted by Dyck, Jolly, and Kramer, which demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between depression and anxiety in clinical samples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

== Limitations ==
Since the PANAS is a self-report questionnaire, it can be difficult to assess people’s mood accurately, as people can overstate or understate their experience of their moods. In addition, the original PANAS had a limited sample size of college students, which concerns with wide applicability to other samples. Furthermore, some studies claim that the PANAS is too long or that its items are redundant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The PANAS does not encompass higher order mood states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a refinement of a concept system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=38109 ISO 704:2009 - Terminology work -- Principles and methods&lt;/ref&gt; Within a terminology model the [[concept]]s ([[object type]]s) of a specific problem or subject area are defined by subject matter experts in terms of concept (object type) definitions and definitions of subordinated concepts or characteristics ([[properties]]). Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:
