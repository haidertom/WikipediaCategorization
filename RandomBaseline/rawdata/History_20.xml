'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of prominent methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.
|salign = right
|source = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cosmic Chemistry: Cosmogony  : Teacher Text : Background Information|publisher=Genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

The '''Crippen Point site''' is a [[Coles Creek culture]] [[archaeological site]] located in [[Sharkey County, Mississippi]]. It is the archaeological [[type site]] of the Crippen Point phase(1050 to 1200 CE) for Late Coles Creek culture in the Lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley. The phase marks a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity by this portion of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Sites for this phase are found in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. After the Crippen Point phase the [[Plaquemine culture]] period begins.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Economic determinism''' is a socioeconomic theory that [[economic]] relationships (such as being an owner or [[capitalist]], or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing [[social class|economic classes]] whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with [[Karl Marx]], the emphasis is on the [[proletariat]] who are considered to be locked in a [[class struggle]] with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of [[socialism]]. [[Marxist theory|Marxist thinkers]] have dismissed plain and unilateral economic [[determinism]] as a form of "vulgar Marxism", or "[[economism]]", nowhere included in Marx's works.

In the writing of American history the term is associated with historian [[Charles A. Beard]] (1874–1948), who was not a Marxist but who emphasized the long-term political contest between bankers and business interest on the one hand, and agrarian interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, "Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography," ''Business History Review'' (1960) 34#1 pp. 113-121 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111785 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Marxist philosophy==
According to [[Marx]], each social [[mode of production]] produces the [[materialism|material conditions]] of its reproduction, that is, [[ideology]] (which gathers all the political, law and cultural spheres). Thus, ideology permits the mode of production to reproduce itself. Furthermore, Marx and Engels are said to have believed,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels, "The German Ideology," from Selected Writings, pg 120&lt;/ref&gt; should a [[revolution]]ary force change the mode of production, the dominant class will immediately set out to create a new society to protect this new economic order. In the modernity of their era, Marx and Engels felt the [[ruling class|propertied class]] had essentially accomplished the establishment of a new societal and economic order, instinctively creating a society protective of their capitalist interests. They made this statement to the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Communist Manifesto]]: "Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your [[jurisprudence]] is but the will of your class, made into law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economic conditions of the existence of your class."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[young Marx]] hence criticized man's [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], a concept which he later replaced by the critique of [[commodity fetishism]]. "Vulgar [[Marxism]]" has considered that the relation between the economical [[infrastructure]] and the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] was a [[unicausality|unicausal]] one, and thus believed in economic determinism. Engels said "The final causes of all social changes and [[political revolution]] are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in man's insight into internal truth and justice... but in the economies of each epoch."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism -- Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Engels advocated a revolution in economic structure as the only valid way of improving society and ending the oppression of the working class.

==Criticism==
Other Marxists and Marx-scholars—including [[György Lukács]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Franz Jakubowski]], [[Edward P. Thompson]] and [[Michael Lowy]]—completely reject the interpretation of Marx and Engels as "economic determinists". They claim this idea is based on a poor and selective reading of Marx and Engels' work.

They argue that this interpretation originated in the early years of the [[Second International]] and was popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], among many others. They refer to the disclaimers by Engels (see [[historical materialism]]) to the effect that while Marx and himself had focused a lot on the economic aspects, they were very aware that this did ''not'' in fact constitute the totality of society or of social life. However, some have viewed such comments as Engels's attempt to extricate himself from an untenable position: [[Max Weber]] and other influential sociological and economic thinker agreed that Marx's views were really unidimensional in regard to economic determinism. They did not agree that economic determinism was a vulgar interpretation of Marx. They regarded this to be the explicitly stated and true interpretation of Marx (See own admission in Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism—Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54). They criticized the simplicity in Marx's arguments and held that ideas and cultural beliefs and values determine societal progress and the evolution of society. (See [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'']] (1905)).

Non-Marxist scholars have also objected that economic determinism is overly generalized, insofar as any serious historical explanation of ''economic'' realities must always refer to ''non-economic'' realities. This became obvious when one had to specify exactly of what the economic determinism precisely consisted. In addition, a lot of confusion about "economic determinism" is due to the conflation of the "commercial" with the "economic". For Marx at least, these were very ''different'' concepts.

The dynamic of history according to Marx was shaped precisely by the clash of those interests ([[class struggle]]), and that clash ''could not be understood'' simply in terms of economic self-interest, because it also involved human needs, customs, traditions, morals and values encompassing a whole way of life. On the other hand, Lenin wrote that "an idea that captures the minds of the masses becomes a material force," meaning that the said needs, customs, traditions, morals and values can be equated to economic forces.

The end result of economic determinism in this view is both [[economism]] (a narrow focus on how people earn their livelihood) and economic [[reductionism]] (the attempt to reduce a complex social reality to one factor—the economic—such that this one factor ''causes'' all other aspects of society).

==Notable economic determinists==

American geostrategist [[Thomas P. M. Barnett]] describes himself as an economic determinist in his book ''The Pentagon's New Map''.

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Divergence''' is a term made popular by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]]'s book by that title, (also known as the '''European miracle''', a term coined by [[Eric Jones (economic historian)|Eric Jones]] in 1981){{sfn|Jones|2003}} referring to the process by which the [[Western world]] (i.e. [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]], eclipsing [[Medieval India]], [[Qing China]], the [[Islamic World]], [[Joseon Korea]], and [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]].

Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, [[colonialism]], resources, and "accidents of history".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

''Technological Forecasting and Social Change''. Volume 95, June 2015, Page 163].&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances, in areas such as [[railroads]], [[steamboats]], [[mining]], and [[agriculture]], were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of [[coal]] as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production.

==Terminology and definition==

The term "Great Divergence" was coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]{{sfn|Frank|2001}} in 1996 and used by [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] in his book ''The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy'' (2000). The same phenomenon was discussed by [[Eric Jones (historian)|Eric Jones]], whose 1981 book ''[[The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia]]'' popularized the alternate term "European Miracle".{{sfn|Jones|2003}} Broadly, both terms signify a [[socioeconomic]] shift in which European countries advanced ahead of others during the [[modern period]].{{sfn|Frank|2001}}

The timing of the Great Divergence is in dispute among historians. The traditional dating is as early as the 16th (or even 15th&lt;ref&gt;Grinin L.,
 Korotayev A., Goldstone J. [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319177793 ''Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective'']. Heidelberg – New York – Dordrecht – London: Springer, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;) century, with scholars arguing that Europe had been on a trajectory of higher growth since that date.{{sfn|Maddison|2001|pp=51–52}} Pomeranz and others argue that the period of most rapid divergence was during the 19th century.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=36, 219–225}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}} Citing nutrition data and chronic European trade deficits as evidence, these scholars argue that before that date [[Asia]] was wealthier and more advanced, especially [[China]] in the [[Yangzi Delta]]{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=36, 219–225}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}} and [[India]],{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}}&lt;ref name="allen2005"&gt;[[Robert C.

==Conditions in pre-Great Divergence cores==

Unlike modern industrial economies, pre-modern economies were constrained by conditions which greatly limited economic growth. Although core regions in Eurasia had achieved a relatively high standard of living by the 18th century, shortages of land, soil degradation, deforestation, lack of dependable energy sources, and other ecological constraints limited growth in per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=219}} Rapid rates of depreciation on capital meant that a great part of savings in pre-modern economies were spent on replacing depleted capital, hampering [[capital accumulation]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Massive windfalls of fuel, land, food and other resources were necessary for continued growth and capital accumulation, leading to [[colonialism]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=241}}
The Industrial Revolution overcame these restraints, allowing rapid, sustained growth in per capita incomes for the first time in human history.

===Western Europe===

After the [[Viking]], Muslim and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions waned in the 10th century, Europe entered a period of prosperity, population growth and territorial expansion known as the [[High Middle Ages]].
Trade and commerce revived, with increased specialization between areas and between the countryside and artisans in towns.
By the 13th century the best land had been occupied and agricultural income began to fall, though trade and commerce continued to expand, especially in [[Venice]] and other northern Italian cities.
The 14th century brought a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]]: famines, wars, the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics.
The resulting drop in the population led to falling rents and rising wages, undermining the [[feudal]] and [[manorial]] relationships that had characterized Medieval Europe.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=11–13}}

According to a 2014 study, "there was a ‘little divergence’ within Europe between 1300 and 1800: real wages in the North Sea area more or less stabilized at the level attained after the Black Death, and remained relatively high (above subsistence) throughout the early modern period (and into the nineteenth century); whereas, on the other hand, real wages in the ‘periphery’ (in Germany, Italy, and Spain) began to fall after the fifteenth century and returned to some kind of subsistence minimum during the 1500–1800 period. This ‘little divergence’ in real wages mirrors a similar divergence in GDP per capita: in the ‘periphery’ of Europe there was almost no per capita growth (or even a decline) between 1500 and 1800, whereas in Holland and England real income continued to rise and more or less doubled in this period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolt|first=Jutta|last2=van Zanden|first2=Jan Luiten|date=2014-08-01|title=The Maddison Project: collaborative research on historical national accounts|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=67|issue=3|pages=627–651|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12032|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Exploration]] navigators discovered new routes to the Americas and Asia.
Commerce expanded, together with innovations such as [[joint stock companies]] and various financial institutions.
New military technologies favored larger units, leading to a concentration of power in states whose finances relied on trade.
France and Spain developed absolute monarchies reliant on high taxes and state-backed monopolies, leading to economic decline.
The [[Dutch Republic]] was controlled by merchants, while [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] gained control of England after a long struggle culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]].
These arrangements proved more hospitable to economic development.{{sfn|North|Thomas|1973|pp=16–18}}
At the end of the 16th century London and Antwerp began pulling away from other European cities, as illustrated in the following graph of real wages in several European cities:{{sfn|Allen|2001}}

[[File:European cities real wages.png|600px|center]]

The West had a series of unique advantages compared to Asia, such as the proximity of coal mines; the discovery of the [[New World]], which alleviated ecological restraints on economic growth (land shortages etc.); and the profits from colonization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=31–69, 187}}

===China===

[[File:China Europe population 1000-1975.svg|thumb|Comparative populations (millions, log scale) of China and Continental Europe between 1000 and 1975.{{sfn|Feuerwerker|1990|p=227}}]]
China had a larger population than Europe throughout the Common Era.{{sfn|Feuerwerker|1990|p=227}}
Unlike Europe, it was politically united for long periods during that time.

During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), the country experienced a revolution in agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=7, 113–199}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen N.|last2=Guan|first2=Hanhui|last3=Li|first3=David D.|date=2017-04-01|title=China, Europe and the Great Divergence: A Study in Historical National Accounting, 980-1850|ssrn=2957511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastery of [[paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]] opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jurchen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics.

In the [[Late Imperial China|late imperial period]] (1368–1911), comprising the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, [[Taxation in premodern China|taxation]] was low, and the economy and population grew significantly, though without substantial increases in productivity.{{sfn|Elvin|1973|pp=91–92, 203–204}}
Chinese goods such as [[silk]], [[tea]] and [[ceramic art|ceramics]] were in great demand in Europe, leading to an inflow of silver, expanding the money supply and facilitating the growth of competitive and stable markets.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|pp=587, 590}}
By the end of the 18th century, population density levels exceeded those in Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=569}} China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe.{{sfn|Myers|Wang|2002|p=579}} The traditional view is that the Great Divergence between China and Europe had begun by 1750, before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broadberry|first=Stephen|last2=Gupta|first2=Bishnupriya|date=2006-02-01|title=The early modern great divergence: wages, prices and economic development in Europe and Asia, 1500–18001|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=2–31|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00331.x|issn=1468-0289|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1709/1/WRAP_Broadberry_CEPR-DP4947%5B1%5D.pdf|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist scholarship, however, estimates that the Great Divergence did not begin until the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=36, 219–225}}{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|pages=101–108|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[early modern Europe]], there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as [[spice]]s, [[Black pepper|pepper]]s, [[indigo]], [[silk]]s, and [[saltpeter]] (for use in [[munitions]]).&lt;ref name="schmidt"&gt;Karl J.

===Middle East===
{{Main|Economic history of the Ottoman Empire}}

The [[Middle East]] was more advanced than Western Europe in 1000 CE, on par by the middle of the 16th century, but by 1750, leading Middle-Eastern states had fallen behind the leading Western European states of Britain and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|date=2017-06-15|title=Jared Rubin: Rulers, religion, and riches: Why the West got rich and the Middle East did not?|journal=Public Choice|language=en|pages=1–4|doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0464-6|issn=0048-5829|volume=172|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Islahi|first=Abdul Azim|title=Book review.

An example of a Middle-Eastern country that had an advanced economy in the early 19th century was [[Ottoman Egypt]], which had a highly productive industrial [[manufacturing]] sector, and [[per-capita income]] that was comparable to leading Western European countries such as [[France]] and higher than that of [[Japan]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="batou" /&gt; Other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], particularly [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and southeastern [[Anatolia]], also had a highly productive manufacturing sector that was evolving in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began programs of state-sponsored [[industrialization]], which included setting up factories for weapons production, an [[iron]] [[foundry]], large-scale cotton cultivation, mills for [[ginning]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] of cotton, and enterprises for agricultural processing.

Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

After the death of Muhammad Ali in 1849, his industrialization programs fell into decline, after which, according to historian Zachary Lockman, “Egypt was well on its way to full integration into a European-dominated world market as supplier of a single raw material, cotton.” Lockman argues that, had Egypt succeeded in its industrialization programs, “it might have shared with Japan [or the United States] the distinction of achieving autonomous capitalist development and preserving its independence.”&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt;

Japanese society was governed by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], which divided Japanese society into a strict hierarchy and intervened considerably in the economy through state monopolies{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=251}} and [[Sakoku Edict of 1635|restrictions on foreign trade]]; however, in practice, the Shogunate's rule was often circumvented.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=214}} From 725-1974, Japan experienced GDP per capita growth at an annual rate of 0.04%, with major periods of positive per capita GDP growth occurring during 1150-1280, 1450-1600 and after 1730.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/Oxford-Economic-and-Social-History-Working-Papers/japan-and-the-great-divergence-730-1874|title=Japan and the Great Divergence, 730-1874 {{!}} Oxford Economic and Social History Working Papers {{!}} Working Papers|website=www.economics.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no significant periods of sustained growth reversals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relative to the United Kingdom, GDP per capita was at roughly similar levels until the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japan and the Great Divergence|last=Francks|first=Penelope|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|pages=31–38|language=en|doi=10.1057/978-1-137-57673-6_4|chapter = Japan in the Great Divergence Debate: The Quantitative Story|isbn = 978-1-137-57672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1850, per capita incomes in Japan were approximately a quarter of the British level.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, 18th-century Japan had a higher [[life expectancy]], 41.1 years for adult males,{{failed verification|date= January 2018}} compared with 31.6 to 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}}

===Korea===

In its earlier days, Korea had healthy international trading relationships, receiving merchants from as far as the Middle East.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=137}}  Because of its strategic value to its neighboring countries, however, Korea had been invaded several times during its Goryeo and Joseon eras, starting with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Though repelled due to its strong navy and aid from China, the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century were particularly devastating to the peninsula and it never truly recovered until the modern era.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=165–168, 229–250}} Due to relatively frequent invasions, increased Western colonization of Asia, and the arrival of Christian missionaries, Korea began a long period of isolationism, maintaining diplomatic relationships primarily with China only.{{sfn|Kim|2012|p=274}} For the rest of the Joseon period, the country was marred by economic hardships, peasant revolts, and political factionalism until it was annexed by Japan in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Kim|2012|pp=270–273}}

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
Pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa was politically fragmented, just as early modern Europe was.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/state-capacity-and-economic-development/650D0C46C22E8BB53D3F5A47F085DB78|title=State Capacity and Economic Development by Mark Dincecco|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africa was however far more sparsely populated than Europe.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; According to University of Michigan political scientist Mark Dincecco, "the high land/ labor ratio may have made it less likely that historical institutional centralization at the “national level” would occur in sub-Saharan Africa, thwarting further state development."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The transatlantic slave trade may have further weakened state power in Africa.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Possible factors==

Scholars have proposed numerous theories to explain why the Great Divergence occurred.

===Coal===
[[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|upright|The distribution of coal deposits shaped industrial development in Britain.]]
In metallurgy and steam engines the Industrial Revolution made extensive use of coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] - as cheaper, more plentiful and more efficient than wood and [[charcoal]].
Coal-fired steam engines also operated in the railways and in shipping, revolutionizing transport in the early 19th century.

Kenneth Pomeranz drew attention to differences in the availability of coal between West and East. Due to regional climate, European coal mines were wetter, and deep mines did not become practical until the introduction of the [[Newcomen steam engine]] to pump out groundwater.  In mines in the arid northwest of China, ventilation to prevent explosions was much more difficult.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=65}}

Another difference involved geographic distance; although China and Europe had comparable mining technologies, the distances between the economically developed regions and coal deposits differed vastly. The largest coal deposits in China are located in the northwest, within reach of the Chinese industrial core during the [[Northern Song]] (960-1127). During the 11th century China developed sophisticated technologies to extract and use coal for energy, leading to soaring iron production.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}} The southward population shift between the 12th and 14th centuries resulted in new centers of Chinese industry far from the major coal deposits. Some small coal deposits were available locally, though their use was sometimes hampered by government regulations. In contrast, Britain contained some of the largest coal deposits in Europe{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=62–66}} - all within a relatively compact island.

[[Ottoman Egypt]], which used steam power for industrial manufacturing [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali|under Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (ruled 1805-1848), had a lack of coal resources. However, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits, and [[boiler]]s were manufactured and installed in various industries. Egypt also imported coal from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Cairo gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]], which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that, in addition to having the necessary conditions for rapid industrialization, Egypt also had the necessary conditions for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Efficiency of markets and state intervention===
A common argument is that Europe had more free and efficient markets than other civilizations, which has been cited as a reason for the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=70}} In Europe, market efficiency was disrupted by the prevalence of [[feudalism]] and [[mercantilism]]. Practices such as [[entail]], which restricted land ownership, hampered the free flow of labor and buying and selling of land. These feudal restrictions on land ownership were especially strong in continental Europe. China had a relatively more liberal land market, hampered only by weak customary traditions.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}} Bound labor, such as [[serfdom]] and [[slavery]] were more prevalent in Europe than in China, even during the Manchu conquest.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=82}} Urban industry in the West was more restrained by [[guild]]s and state-enforced monopolies than in China, where in the 18th century the principal monopolies governed salt and foreign trade through [[Guangzhou]].{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=87, 196}}  Pomeranz rejects the view that market institutions were the cause of the Great Divergence, and concludes that China was closer to the ideal of a market economy than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] presents a contrary argument, that Western countries such as the United States, Britain and Spain did not initially have [[free trade]], but had [[protectionist]] policies in the early 19th century, as did China and Japan. In contrast, he cites the [[Ottoman Empire]] as an example of a state that did have free trade, which he argues had a negative economic impact and contributed to its [[deindustrialization]]. The Ottoman Empire had a [[Economic liberalism|liberal trade]] policy, open to foreign imports, which has origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673 and 1740, which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to only 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but later criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate:&lt;ref name="bairoch31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been free trade in Turkey, and what has it produced? It has destroyed some of the finest manufactures of the world. As late as 1812 these manufactures existed; but they have been destroyed. That was the consequences of competition in Turkey, and its effects have been as pernicious as the effects of the contrary principle in Spain.}}

===State prohibition of new technology===
[[Jared Diamond]] in the book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' argues that explicit outlawing of new technology was an important explanation for the divergence. For example, in China in 1432, a new Emperor outlawed the building of ocean-going ships, in which China was the world leader at the time. Diamond traces this to differences in geography. Outside Europe advanced cultures developed in areas whose [[geography]] was conducive to large, monolithic, isolated empires. In these conditions policies of technological and social stagnation could persist. On the other hand, Europe's geography favored [[balkanization]] into smaller, closer, nation-states, as its many natural barriers (mountains, rivers) provide defensible borders. As a result, governments that suppressed economic and technological progress soon corrected their mistakes or were out-competed relatively quickly. He argues that geographical factors created the conditions for more rapid internal superpower change (Spain succeeded by France and then by the United Kingdom) than was possible elsewhere in Eurasia.

===Innovation===
Beginning in the early 19th century, economic prosperity rose greatly in the West due to improvements in technological efficiency,{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} as evidenced by the advent of new conveniences including the [[railroad]], steamboat, steam engine, and the use of [[coal]] as a fuel source.  These innovations contributed to the Great Divergence, elevating [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] to high economic standing relative to the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

It has been argued the attitude of the [[Eastern world|East]] towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to [[David Landes]], after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, it seemed like the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement on the basis of their indigenous traditions and achievements.{{sfn|Landes|2006|p=5}} The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.{{sfn|Lin|1995|p=276}}

In the early 19th century, [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali]] began a program of state-sponsored [[industrialization]],&lt;ref name="lockman"/&gt; quick to adopt [[steam engine]] technology, and manufacturing [[boiler]]s for installation in a number of industries, including [[ironworks]], [[textile manufacturing]], [[paper mill]]s, and [[hulling]] mills.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt; While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]'s prospectors searched for coal deposits in Egypt while importing coal from overseas at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s when Egypt gained access to coal sources in [[Lebanon]] with its yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that Egypt had the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization in the early 19th century, and for the adoption of [[oil]] as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="batou193"/&gt;

===Wages and living standards===
Classical economists, beginning with [[Adam Smith]] and [[Thomas Malthus]], argued that high wages in the West stimulated labor-saving technological advancements.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=49}}{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=525–526}} Economic historian Robert Allen has argued that high wages, cheap capital and very cheap energy in Britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution to occur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|date=2011-04-01|title=Explaining the first Industrial Revolution: two views|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/15/1/153/512087/Explaining-the-first-Industrial-Revolution-two|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=15|issue=1|pages=153–168|doi=10.1017/S1361491610000201|issn=1361-4916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development, and to put technology to use in Britain than other societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, more recent studies have depicted [[living standards]] in 18th century China and pre-Industrial Revolution Europe as comparable.{{sfn|Hobson|2004|p=77}}{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=36}} Life expectancy in China and Japan for adult males were 39.6 and 41.1 respectively, compared with 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=37}} Chinese laborers in the Yangtze delta consumed 4,600 calories per day on average (laborers in China overall consumed 2,637 calories on average) compared with 2,000-2,500 calories per day for England.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=39}} According to Pomeranz and others, there was modest per capita growth in both regions,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=107}} the Chinese economy was not stagnant, and in many areas, especially agriculture, was ahead of Western Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=45–48}} Chinese cities were also ahead in public health.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=46}} Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] estimated that China's GNP per capita in 1800 was $228 in 1960 [[US dollars]] (${{Inflation|US|228|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than Western Europe's $213 (${{Inflation|US|213|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars) at the time.&lt;ref name="braude534"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century|volume=3|author=[[Fernand Braudel]]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1982|page=534|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&amp;pg=PA534|isbn=9780520081161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been similar findings for India. [[Real wages]] and living standards in 18th-century [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}}&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; Workers in the [[textile industry]], for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore than they did in Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=38–45}} In the late 18th century, Mysore's average [[per-capita income]] was five times higher than [[subsistence]] level,{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|p=45}} i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 [[international dollars]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Economy Volume 1: A Millennial Perspective Volume 2: Historical Statistics|author=[[Angus Maddison]]|publisher=Academic Foundation|year=2007|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I242EL00ieAC&amp;pg=PA260|isbn=9788171886135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2007), ''Contours of the World Economy, 1–2030 AD. Essays in Macro-Economic History'', [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-19-922721-1}}, p.&amp;nbsp;382, table A.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly for [[Ottoman Egypt]], its per-capita income in 1800 was comparable to that of leading Western European countries such as [[France]], and higher than the overall average income of Europe and Japan.&lt;ref name="batou"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC|pages=181–196|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian Jean Barou estimated that, in terms of 1960 dollars, [[Egypt]] in 1800 had a per-capita income of $232 (${{Inflation|US|232|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars). In comparison, per-capita income in terms of 1960 dollars for France in 1800 was $240 (${{Inflation|US|240|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), for [[Eastern Europe]] in 1800 was $177 (${{Inflation|US|177|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), and for Japan in 1800 was $180 (${{Inflation|US|180|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref name="batou189"&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Development and Underdevelopment: The Precocious Attempts at Industrialization of the Periphery, 1800-1870|author=Jean Batou|publisher=[[:fr:Librairie Droz|Librairie Droz]]|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjD4SCOE6IgC&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|isbn=9782600042932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poverty From The Wealth of Nations: Integration and Polarization in the Global Economy since 1760|author=[[M.

According to Paul Bairoch, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"/&gt; He estimated that, in 1750, the average [[GNP per capita]] in the [[Eastern world]] (particularly China, India and the Middle East) was $188 in 1960 dollars (${{Inflation|US|188|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars), higher than the West's $182 (${{Inflation|US|182|1960|1990|fmt=c}} in 1990 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|page=104|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that it was after 1800 that Western European per-capita income pulled ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John M.

===European colonialism===
A number of economic historians have argued that [[European colonialism]] played a major role in the [[deindustrialization]] of non-Western societies. [[Paul Bairoch]], for example, cites [[British colonialism]] in India as a primary example, but also argues that European [[colonialism]] played a major role in the deindustrialization of other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and [[Latin America]], and contributed to a sharp economic decline in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=88–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern [[Economic history|economic historians]] have blamed [[British Empire|British colonial rule]] for India's deindustrialization in particular.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; The colonization of India is seen as a major factor behind both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt;

Up until the 19th century, India was the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer,{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} with [[Bengal Subah|Bengal]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] the centers of cotton production.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}} In order to compete with India, Britain invested in labour-saving technical progress for [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]], while implementing [[protectionist]] policies such as bans and [[tariff]]s to restrict Indian imports. At the same time, the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] contributed to its deindustrialization, with the decline of native industry opening up a new market for British goods.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods while restricting Indian imports to Britain, and raw cotton was imported from India without taxes or tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Process of Economic Development|author=James Cypher|year=2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxFxAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|isbn=9781136168284}}&lt;/ref&gt; India thus served as both an important supplier of raw goods such as cotton to British factories and a large [[captive market]] for British manufactured goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hobson-Jobson: The Definitive Glossary of British India|author=[[Henry Yule]], [[A. C. Burnell]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2013|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the capital amassed from [[Bengal]] following its conquest after the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757 was used to invest in British industries such as textile manufacturing and greatly increase British wealth.&lt;ref name="tong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esposito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ray"/&gt; Britain eventually surpassed India as the world's leading cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} British colonial rule has been blamed for the subsequently dismal state of [[British India]]'s economy, with investment in Indian industries limited since it was a colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colonial Power, Colonial Texts: India in the Modern British Novel|first=M.

===Luxury consumption===
Luxury consumption is regarded by many scholars to have stimulated the development of [[capitalism]] and thus contributed to the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=114–115}} Proponents of this view argue that workshops, which manufactured luxury articles for the wealthy, gradually amassed capital to expand their production and then emerged as large firms producing for a mass market; they believe that Western Europe's unique tastes for luxury stimulated this development further than other cultures. However, others counter that luxury workshops were not unique to Europe; large cities in China and Japan also possessed many luxury workshops for the wealthy,{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=163}} and that luxury workshops do not necessarily stimulate the development of "capitalistic firms".{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=164}}

===Property rights===
Differences in property rights have been cited as a possible cause of the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Weingast|first2=Barry R.|date=1989|title=Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England|jstor=2122739|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=49|issue=4|pages=803–832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James|date=2005|title=The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change, and Economic Growth|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=546–579|doi=10.1257/0002828054201305|issn=0002-8282|hdl=1721.1/64034}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view states that Asian merchants could not develop and accumulate capital because of the risk of state expropriation and claims from fellow kinsmen, which made property rights very insecure compared to those of Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=169}} However, others counter that many European merchants were de facto expropriated through defaults on government debt, and that the threat of expropriation by Asian states was not much greater than in Europe, except in Japan.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=170}}

Government and policies are seen as an integral part of modern societies and have played a major role in how different economies have been formed. The Eastern societies had governments which were controlled by the ruling dynasties and thus, were not a separate entity. Their governments at the time lacked policies that fostered innovation and thus resulted in slow advancements. As explained by Cohen, the east had a restrictive system of trade that went against the free world market theory; there was no political liberty or policies that encouraged the capitalist market (Cohen, 1993). This was in contrast to the western society that developed commercial laws and property rights which allowed for the protection and liberty of the marketplace. Their capitalist ideals and market structures encouraged innovation.{{sfn|Landes|2006}}{{sfn|Lin|1995}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|year=1986|publisher=New York Basic Books |title=How The West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation Of The Industrial World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waley-Cohen|first=Joanna|title=China and Western Technology in the Late Eighteenth Century|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1993|volume=99|issue=5|pages=1525–1544|jstor=2167065|doi=10.2307/2167065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomeranz (2000) argues that much of the land market in China was free, with many supposedly hereditary tenants and landlords being frequently removed or forced to sell their land. Although Chinese customary law specified that people within the village were to be offered the land first, Pomeranz states that most of the time the land was offered to more capable outsiders, and argues that China actually had a freer land market than Europe.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=70–71}}
Pomeranz does not address the most common form of land sale, known as the conditional sale. The conditional sale allowed the seller to return to the buyer many years after the sale, and many times, to demand extra payments. He also does not account for the inability of landlords to collect rent on second crops.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}}

However, [[Robert Brenner]] and Chris Isett emphasize differences in land tenancy rights.  They argue that in the lower Yangtze, most farmers either owned land or held secure tenancy at fixed rates of rent, so that neither farmers nor landlords were exposed to competition. In 15th century England, lords had lost their serfs, but were able to assert control over almost all of the land, creating a rental market for tenant farmers.  This created competitive pressures against subdividing plots, and the fact that plots could not be directly passed on to sons forced them to delay marriage until they had accumulated their own possessions.  Thus in England both agricultural productivity and population growth were subject to market pressures throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Brenner|Isett|2002}}

A 2017 study found that secure property rights in Europe, but not in large parts of the Middle-East, contributed to the increase of expensive labour-saving capital goods, such as water-mills, windmills, and cranes, in medieval Europe but its decrease in the Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Bavel|first=Bas|last2=Buringh|first2=Eltjo|last3=Dijkman|first3=Jessica|title=Mills, cranes, and the great divergence: the use of immovable capital goods in western Europe and the Middle East, ninth to sixteenth centuries|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/ehr.12571|issn=1468-0289|volume=71|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World===
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|Distribution of [[colonial empire]]s by the end of the 18th century]]
A variety of theories posit Europe's unique relationship with the New World as a major cause of the Great Divergence. The high profits earned from the colonies and the slave trade constituted 7&amp;nbsp;percent a year, a relatively high rate of return considering the high rate of depreciation on pre-industrial capital stocks, which limited the amount of savings and capital accumulation.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=187}} Early European colonization was sustained by profits through selling New World goods to Asia, especially silver to China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=190}} According to Pomeranz, the most important advantage for Europe was the vast amount of fertile, uncultivated land in the Americas which could be used to grow large quantities of farm products required to sustain European economic growth and allowed labor and land to be freed up in Europe for industrialization.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=264}} New World exports of wood, cotton, and wool are estimated to have saved England the need for 23 to {{convert|25|e6acre|km2}} of cultivated land (by comparison, the total amount of cultivated land in England was just 17 million acres), freeing up immense amounts of resources. The New World also served as a market for European manufactures.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|p=266}}

Chen (2012) also suggested that the New World as a necessary factor for industrialization, and trade as a supporting factor causing less developed areas to concentrate on agriculture supporting industrialized regions in Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}}

===High-level equilibrium trap===
The [[high-level equilibrium trap]] theory argues that China did not undergo an indigenous industrial revolution since its economy was in a stable equilibrium, where supply and demand for labor were equal, disincentivizing the development of labor-saving capital.

===Culture===
Rosenberg and Birdzell claims that the so-called "eastern culture" of "respect" and "unquestionable devotion" to the ruling dynasty was as a result of a culture where the control of the dynasty led to a "silent society" that "did not ask questions or experiment without the approval or order from the ruling class". On the other hand, they claimed that the West of the late medieval era did not have a central authority or absolute state, which allowed for a free flow of ideas (Rosenberg, Birdzell, 1986). This so-called "eastern culture" also supposedly showed a "dismissal of change" due to their "fear of failure" and disregard for the imitation of outside inventions and science; this was different from the "western culture" which they claimed to be willing to experiment and imitate others to benefit their society. They claimed that this was a culture where change was encouraged, and sense of anxiety and disregard for comfort led them to be more innovative. [[Max Weber]] argued in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' that capitalism in northern Europe evolved when the [[Protestant work ethic]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]])  influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In his book ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' he blames Chinese culture for the non-emergence of capitalism in China. Chen (2012) similarly claims that cultural differences were the most fundamental cause for the divergence, arguing that the [[Humanism]] of the [[Renaissance]] followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (including revolutionary changes in attitude towards religion) enabled a mercantile, innovative, individualistic, and capitalistic spirit. For [[Ming Dynasty]] China, he claims there existed repressive measures which stifled dissenting opinions and nonconformity. He claimed that [[Confucianism]] taught that disobedience to one's superiors was supposedly tantamount to "sin". In addition Chen claimed that merchants and artificers had less prestige than they did in Western Europe.{{sfn|Chen|2012}} [[Justin Yifu Lin]] has argued for the role of the [[imperial examination]] system in removing the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation.&lt;ref name=Lin2011&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, "Demystifying the Chinese Economy", 2011, Cambridge University Press, Preface xiv, http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many scholars who have studied Confucian teachings have criticized the claim that the philosophy promoted unquestionable loyalty to one's superiors and the state. The core of Confucian philosophy itself was already [[Humanism|Humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|Rationalistic]]; it "[does] not share a belief in divine law and [does] not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will."&lt;ref name="juergensmeyer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer |first= Mark |year= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location = |isbn = 978-0-19-518835-6 |page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the central teachings of Confucianism is that one should remonstrate with authority. Many Confucians throughout history disputed their superiors in order to not only prevent the superiors and the rulers from wrongdoing, but also to maintain the independent spirits of the Confucians.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Xu Fuguan 徐復觀, ''Xueshu yu Zhengzhi zhi jian'' 學術與政治之間. (Taibei: Taiwan Xuesheng Shuju, 1980), 101–126, 331–395, 497–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the merchant class of China throughout all of Chinese history were usually wealthy and held considerable influence above their supposed social standing.&lt;ref name=Gernet /&gt; Historians like Yu Yingshi and Billy So have shown that as Chinese society became increasingly commercialized from the [[Song dynasty]] onward, Confucianism had gradually begun to accept and even support business and trade as legitimate and viable professions, as long as merchants stayed away from unethical actions. Merchants in the meantime had also benefited from and utilized Confucian ethics in their business practices. By the Song period, the [[Scholar-officials]] themselves were using intermediary agents to participate in trading.&lt;ref name=Gernet&gt;Gernet, Jacques (1962). ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright. Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}} pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
This is true especially in the [[Ming]]-[[Qing]] dynasties, when the social status of merchants had rose to such significance&lt;ref&gt;Yu Yingshi 余英時, ''Zhongguo Jinshi Zongjiao Lunli yu Shangren Jingshen'' 中國近世宗教倫理與商人精神. (Taibei: Lianjing Chuban Shiye Gongsi, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy So, ''Prosperity, Region, and Institutions in Maritime China.'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), 253–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy So, “Institutions in market economies of premodern maritime China.” In Billy So ed., ''The Economy of Lower Yangzi Delta in Late Imperial China.'' (New York: Routledge, 2013), 208–232.&lt;/ref&gt; that by the late Ming period, many scholar-officials were unabashed to declare publicly in their official family histories that they had family members who were merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Brook|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-22154-0}} p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, while Confucianism did not actively promote profit seeking, it did not hinder China’s commercial development either.

Of the developed cores of the [[Old world]], India was distinguished by its [[Caste system in India|caste system]] of bound labor, which hampered economic and population growth and resulted in relative underdevelopment compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their [[Unfree labour|unfree laborers]] harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit and the development of markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India was not a very likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=212–214}}

Aspects of [[Islamic law]] have been proposed as an argument for the divergence for the [[Muslim world]]. Economist [[Timur Kuran]] argues that Islamic institutions which had at earlier stages promoted development later started preventing more advanced development by hampering formation of corporations, capital accumulation, mass production, and impersonal transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran, ''The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East'', 2010, Princeton University Press, http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9273.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar arguments proposed include the gradual prohibition of independent religious judgements ([[Ijtihad]]) and a strong [[communalism]] which limited contacts with outside groups and the development of institutions dealing with more temporary interactions of various kinds, according to Kuran.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Kuran Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft Vol. 153, No. 1, The New Institutional Economics Religion and Economics (March 1997), pp. 41–71 Published by: Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752985&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Donald Quataert]], however, the Ottoman Middle East's manufacturing sector was highly productive and evolving in the 19th century. Quataert criticizes arguments rooted in [[Orientalism]], such as "now-discredited [[stereotype]]s concerning the inferiority of [[Islam]]", economic institutions having stopped evolving after the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and decline of Ijtihad in religion negatively affecting economic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman Manufacturing in the Age of the Industrial Revolution|author=[[Donald Quataert]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrZn35yDeYMC&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–8|isbn=9780521893015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] noted that [[Ottoman law]] promoted [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[free trade]] earlier than Britain and the United States, arguing that free trade had a negative economic impact on the Ottoman Empire and contributed to its deindustrialization, in contrast to the more [[protectionist]] policies of Britain and the United States in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="bairoch31"/&gt;

In his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] argues that the human psychological traits (such as literacy, numeracy, and delayed gratification) needed for the divergence spread in England between 1200 and 1800 "at least culturally and perhaps also genetically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Farewell to Alms | first = Gregory | last = Clark | author-link = Gregory Clark (economist) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-691-12135-2 | pages = 8, 11, 120, 165, 271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shorter online version of Clark's work can be found here:  http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Capitalism%20Genes.pdf

===Political fragmentation===
Economic historian [[Joel Mokyr]] has argued that political fragmentation (the presence of a large number of European states) made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive, as entrepreneurs, innovators, ideologues and heretics could easily flee to a neighboring state in the event that the one state would try to suppress their ideas and activities. This is what set Europe apart from the technologically advanced, large unitary empires such as China. China had both a printing press and movable type, yet the industrial revolution would occur in Europe. In Europe, political fragmentation was coupled with an "integrated market for ideas" where Europe's intellectuals used the lingua franca of Latin, had a shared intellectual basis in Europe's classical heritage and the pan-European institution of the [[Republic of Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10835.html|title=Mokyr, J.: A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.

Economic historian Tuan-Hwee Sng has argued that the large size of the Chinese state contributed to its relative decline in the 19th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sng|first=Tuan-Hwee|date=2014-10-01|title=Size and dynastic decline: The principal-agent problem in late imperial China, 1700–1850|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498314000205|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=54|pages=107–127|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast size of the Chinese empire created a severe principal-agent problem and constrained how the country was governed. In particular, taxes had to be kept low due to the emperor's weak oversight of his agents and the need to keep corruption in check. The Chinese state's fiscal weaknesses were long masked by its huge tax base. However, economic and demographic expansion in the eighteenth century exacerbated the problems of administrative control. This put a further squeeze on the nation's finances and left China ill-prepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One reason why Japan was able to modernize and adopt the technologies of the West was due to its much smaller size relative to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Mark|last2=Moriguchi|first2=Chiaki|last3=Sng|first3=Tuan-Hwee|date=2015-10-28|title=Geopolitics and Asia's Little Divergence: A Comparative Analysis of State Building in China and Japan after 1850|ssrn=2682702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jeffrey G. Williamson]] has argued that India went through a period of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect outcome of the collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]], with [[British India|British rule]] later causing further deindustrialization.&lt;ref name="williamson"/&gt; According to Williamson, the decline of the Mughal Empire led to a decline in agricultural productivity, which drove up food prices, then [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] wages, and then textile prices, which led to India losing a share of the world textile market to Britain even before it had superior [[Industrial Revolution|factory technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and Poverty: When the Third World Fell Behind|author=[[Jeffrey G. Williamson]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2011|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiDslL0o-hUC&amp;pg=PA91|isbn=9780262295185}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Indian textiles still maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Economic historian Prasannan Parthasarathi, however, has argued that there wasn't any such economic decline for several post-Mughal states, notably [[Bengal Subah]] and the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], which were comparable to Britain in the late 18th century, until British colonial policies caused deindustrialization.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011}}

Stanford political scientist Gary W. Cox argues in a 2017 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Gary W.|date=2017|title=Political Institutions, Economic Liberty, and the Great Divergence|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/political-institutions-economic-liberty-and-the-great-divergence/BF095246D91A9729C1A575B9A6706C95|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=77|issue=3|pages=724–755|doi=10.1017/S0022050717000729|issn=0022-0507|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her institutional innovations to foster substantial areas of “economic liberty,” where European merchants could organize production freer of central regulation, faced fewer central restrictions on their shipping and pricing decisions, and paid lower tariffs and tolls than their counterparts elsewhere in Eurasia. When fragmentation afforded merchants multiple politically independent routes on which to ship their goods, European rulers refrained from imposing onerous regulations and levying arbitrary tolls, lest they lose mercantile traffic to competing realms. Fragmented control of trade routes magnified the spillover effects of political reforms. If parliament curbed arbitrary regulations and tolls in one realm, then neighboring rulers might have to respond in kind, even if they themselves remained without a parliament. Greater economic liberty, fostered by the interaction of fragmentation and reform, unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth. &lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Justin Yifu Lin]] argued that China's large population size proved beneficial in technological advancements prior to the 14th century, but that the large population size was not an important factor in the kind of technological advancements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Justin Yifu|date=1995-01-01|title=The Needham Puzzle: Why the Industrial Revolution Did Not Originate in China|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/452150|issn=0013-0079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early technological advancements depended on "learning by doing" (where population size was an important factor, as advances could spread over a large political unit), whereas the Industrial Revolution was the result of experimentation and theory (where population size is less important.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Representative government===
A number of economists have argued that representative government was a factor in the Great Divergence.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The argue that absolutist governments, where rulers are not broadly accountable, are bad for property rights and innovation, and that they are prone to corruption and rent-seeking.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Long|first=J.

===Globalization===
A 2017 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that "globalization was the major driver of the economic divergence between the rich and the poor portions of the world in the years 1850-1900."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luigi|first=Pascali|date=|title=The Wind of Change: Maritime Technology, Trade, and Economic Development|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=0|doi=10.1257/aer.20140832&amp;&amp;from=f|issn=0002-8282|doi-broken-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ehsthelongrun.net/2017/08/24/globalisation-and-economic-development-a-lesson-from-history/|title=Globalisation and Economic Development: A Lesson from History|last=ehs1926|date=2017-08-24|website=The Long Run|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states that benefited from globalization were "characterised by strong constraints on executive power, a distinct feature of the institutional environment that has been demonstrated to favour private investment."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Chance===
A number of economic historians have posited that the Industrial Revolution may have partly occurred where and when it did due to luck and chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Zilibotti|first2=Fabrizio|date=1997-08-01|title=Was Prometheus Unbound by Chance?

==Economic effects==
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] fuelled primarily by [[coal]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the world]]

The Old World methods of agriculture and production could only sustain certain lifestyles. Industrialization dramatically changed the European economy and allowed it to attain much higher levels of wealth and productivity than the other Old World cores. Although Western technology later spread to the East, differences in uses preserved the Western lead and accelerated the Great Divergence.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Productivity===

When analyzing comparative use-efficiency, the economic concept of [[total factor productivity]] (TFP) is applied to quantify differences between countries.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  TFP analysis controls for differences in energy and raw material inputs across countries and is then used to calculate [[productivity]]. The difference in productivity levels, therefore, reflects efficiency of energy and raw materials use rather than the raw materials themselves.{{sfn|Comin|2008}}  TFP analysis has shown that Western countries had higher TFP levels on average in the 19th century than Eastern countries such as [[India]] or [[China]], showing that Western productivity had surpassed the East.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

===Per capita income===
Some of the most striking evidence for the Great Divergence comes from data on [[per capita income]].{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}  The West's rise to power directly coincides with per capita income in the West surpassing that in the East.  This change can be attributed largely to the mass transit technologies, such as [[railroads]] and [[steamboats]], that the West developed in the 19th century.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}} The construction of large ships, trains, and railroads greatly increased productivity. These modes of transport made moving large quantities of coal, corn, grain, livestock and other goods across countries more efficient, greatly reducing transportation costs. These differences allowed Western productivity to exceed that of other regions.{{sfn|Clark|Feenstra|2003}}

Economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] has estimated the GDP per capita of several major countries in 1960 US dollars after the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, as shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bairoch|1976}}, p. 286, table 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biaroch European GDP per capita 1830-1890.svg|center]]

His estimates show that the GDP per capita of Western European countries rose rapidly after industrialization.

For the 18th century, and in comparison to non-European regions, Bairoch in 1995 stated that, in the mid-18th century, "the average [[standard of living]] in Europe was a little bit lower than that of the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="Jochnick"&gt;Chris Jochnick, Fraser A. Preston (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SpqmITSjgWAC&amp;pg=PA86 ''Sovereign Debt at the Crossroads: Challenges and Proposals for Resolving the Third World Debt Crisis'', pages 86-87], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{details|British Agricultural Revolution}}
Before and during the early 19th century, much of continental European agriculture was underdeveloped compared to Asian Cores and England.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This left Europe with abundant idle natural resources. [[England]], on the other hand, had reached the limit of its agricultural productivity well before the beginning of the 19th century.  Rather than taking the costly route of improving soil fertility, the English increased labor productivity by industrializing agriculture.  From 1750 to 1850, European nations experienced population booms; however,  European agriculture was barely able to keep pace with the dietary needs. Imports from the Americas, and the reduced caloric intake required by [[proletariat|industrial workers]] compared to farmers allowed England to cope with the food shortages.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=215–219}} By the turn of the 19th century, much European farmland had been eroded and depleted of nutrients.  Fortunately, through improved farming techniques, the import of [[fertilizers]], and [[reforestation]], Europeans were able to recondition their soil and prevent food shortages from hampering industrialization. Meanwhile, many other formerly [[hegemonic]] areas of the world were struggling to feed themselves&amp;nbsp;– notably China.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=223–225}}

===Fuel and resources===
The global demand for wood, a major resource required for industrial growth and development, was increasing in the first half of the 19th century.  A lack of interest of [[silviculture]] in Western Europe, and a lack of forested land, caused wood shortages.  By the mid-19th century, forests accounted for less than 15% of land use in most Western European countries. Fuel costs rose sharply in these countries throughout the 18th century and many households and factories were forced to ration their usage, and eventually adopt forest conservation policies.  It was not until the 19th century that [[coal]] began providing much needed relief to the European energy shortage.  China had not begun to use coal on a large scale until around 1900, giving Europe a huge lead on modern energy production.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=219–225}}

Through the 19th century, Europe had vast amounts of unused [[arable land]] with adequate water sources. However, this was not the case in China; most idle lands suffered from a lack of water supply, so forests had to be cultivated.  Since the mid-19th century, northern China's water supplies have been declining, reducing its agricultural output.  By growing [[cotton]] for [[textiles]], rather than importing, China exacerbated its water shortage.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=230–238}}
During the 19th century, supplies of wood and land decreased considerably, greatly slowing growth of Chinese per capita incomes.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=228–219}}

===Trade===
[[File:Triangular trade.svg|thumb|right|18th century triangular trade between Europe, the New World, and Africa.]]

During the era of European imperialism, [[periphery countries]] were often set up as specialized producers of specific resources. Although these specializations brought the periphery countries temporary economic benefit, the overall effect inhibited the industrial development of periphery territories.  Cheaper resources for [[core countries]] through trade deals with specialized periphery countries allowed the core countries to advance at a much greater pace, both economically and industrially, than the rest of the world.{{sfn|Williamson|2008}}

Europe's access to a larger quantity of raw materials and a larger market to sell its manufactured goods gave it a distinct advantage through the 19th century. In order to further industrialize, it was imperative for the developing core areas to acquire resources from less densely populated areas, since they lacked the lands required to supply these resources themselves. Europe was able to trade manufactured goods to their [[colonies]], including the Americas, for raw materials. The same sort of trading could be seen throughout regions in China and Asia, but colonization brought a distinct advantage to the West. As these sources of raw materials began to [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialize]], they would turn to [[import substitution]], depriving the hegemonic nations of a market for their manufactured goods. Since European nations had control over their colonies, they were able to prevent this from happening.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=242–243}} Britain was able to use import substitution to its benefit when dealing with textiles from [[India]]. Through industrialization, Britain was able to increase cotton productivity enough to make it lucrative for domestic production, and overtake India as the world's leading cotton supplier.{{sfn|Broadberry|Gupta|2005}} Although Britain had limited cotton imports to protect its own industries, they allowed cheap British products into colonial India from the early 19th century.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=128, 226–227, 244}} The colonial administration failed to promote Indian industry, preferring to export raw materials.{{sfn|Parthasarathi|2011|pp=252–258}}

Western Europe was also able to establish profitable trade with Eastern Europe. Countries such as [[Prussia]], [[Bohemia]] and [[Poland]] had very little freedom in comparison to the West;{{vague|date=November 2010}} forced labor left much of Eastern Europe with little time to work towards proto-industrialization and ample manpower to generate raw materials.{{sfn|Pomeranz|2000|pp=257–258}}

===Guilds and journeymanship===
A 2017 study in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' argued, "medieval European institutions such as guilds, and specific features such as journeymanship, can explain the rise of Europe relative to regions that relied on the transmission of knowledge within closed kinship systems (extended families or clans)".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Croix|first=David|last2=Doepke|first2=Matthias|last3=Mokyr|first3=Joel|title=Clans, Guilds, and Markets: Apprenticeship Institutions and Growth in the Pre-Industrial Economy|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|doi=10.1093/qje/qjx026|volume=133|year=2017|pages=1–70|hdl=2078.1/172953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds and journeymanship were superior for creating and disseminating knowledge, which contributed to the occurrence of the Industrial Revolution in Europe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''John F. Richards''' (November 3, 1938 - August 23, 2007) was a historian of [[South Asia]] and in particular of the [[Mughal Empire]]. He was Professor of History at [[Duke University]], [[North Carolina]], and a recipient in 2007 of the Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies Award. He participated in and encouraged a multi-disciplinary, multi-regional approach to studies.&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

== Life ==
John Richards was born on November 3, 1938 in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]]. His parents, Frank F. Richards and Ella Higgins Richards, subsequently had two more children.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web |title=History Professor John Richards Dies at Age 68 |date=August 30, 2007 |publisher=Durham Herald-Sun |via=DukeToday |url=https://today.duke.edu/2007/08/richards.html |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards graduated from the [[University of New Hampshire]] as [[valedictorian]] in 1961 and on the same day he married his high school sweetheart, Ann Berry. The couple moved to California and, in 1968, to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] when he received an appointment at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was awarded a PhD in History by the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1970. His thesis, later published at ''Mughal Administration in Golconda'' (1975), was written under the direction of [[Thomas R. Metcalf]]. This established him as "one of the leading historians of the Mughal Empire in the United States", according to [[David Gilmartin]], and he went on to write a volume of ''[[The New Cambridge History of India]]'' titled ''The Mughal Empire (1993).&lt;ref name="gilmartin"&gt;{{cite web |title=About John F. Richards |first=David |last=Gilmartin |others=Guha, Sumit; Bhagavan, Manu |publisher=Society for Advancing the History of South Asia |url=http://sahsa.uchicago.edu/node/19 |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Richards on the Mughal period include ''The Imperial Monetary System of Mughal India'' (1987) and ''Kingship and Authority in South Asia'' (1998). The impact of the Mughal empire on world events caused him to consider the Mughals to be an "early modern" empire, rather than the medieval one that most commentators believed it to be. It was this belief that led him into studies of world trade and state finances, as well as early modern world environmental history. In 2003, he published ''The Unending Frontier: Environmental History of the Early Modern World'' (2003).&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt;

Richards had worked at Duke University since 1977.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; He was heavily involved with administration of the [[Council of American Overseas Research Centers]] and in reforming the troubled [[American Institute of Pakistan Studies]]. He was also in the vanguard of establishing the [[American Institute of Afghanistan Studies]], the first meeting of which took place at Duke University in 2003&lt;ref name="gilmartin" /&gt; and of which he was the founding president.&lt;ref name="aha" /&gt;

Richards died of cancer at home in [[Durham, North Carolina]], on August 23, 2007, days before he was due to retire. He had two children.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

A ''[[festschrift]]'' titled ''Expanding Frontiers in South Asian and World History: Essays in Honour of John F. Richards'' was published in 2013, edited by [[Richard M. Eaton]], [[Munis D. Faruqui]], Gilmartin and [[Sunil Kumar]].

In 2011, the [[American Historical Association]] inaugurated a prize named in his honor. This is awarded for the best book on South Asian history published during each year.&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web |title=John F. Richards Prize for South Asian History to Be Launched |first=Robert B. |last=Townsend |date=January 2011 |publisher=American Historical Association |url=http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/january-2011/john-f-richards-prize-for-south-asian-history-to-be-launched |accessdate=2015-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   

All the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   

Scholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  

== History of Muslim states==
The [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].

While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into "Islamic empires", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.

== Caliphates ==
[[Image:Age-of-caliphs.png|right|240px|thumb|Umayyad Empire at its greatest extent]]
* The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (632–661) – Beginning of the Islamic Empire

** The Umayyad [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] (929–1031)
* The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750–1258) – Successor of the Umayyad Caliphate, Fall of Baghdad ([[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|1258]]) 

* The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] (909–1171) End of the Arab Empire
* The [[Almohad Caliphate]] (1121–1269)
* The [[Ottoman Caliphate]] (1362–1924)
* The [[Sokoto Caliphate]] (1804-1903)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37223">This '''list of preserved historic blast furnaces''' contains decommissioned [[blast furnace]]s, of which substantial remains survive. The furnaces are preserved in a [[park]] or museum, or as a site otherwise open to visitors, or intended to become such.

While pre-20th-century blast furnaces already have a long history of monument preservation, the perception of 20th century mass production blast furnace installations as [[industrial heritage]] is a comparably new trend. For a long time, it has been normal procedure for such a blast furnace to be demolished after being decommissioned and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. It has only been in recent years{{When|date=January 2011}} that numerous countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their [[industrial history]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, the first such blast furnace not to be demolished stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]] (decommissioned in 1968), followed by the last blast furnace of Yahata Steel Works in [[Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]] (decommissioned in 1972) and the "Carrie Furnaces" in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] (decommissioned in 1978). One of the two blast furnaces in [[Neunkirchen, Saarland|Neunkirchen]] in [[Germany]] (decommissioned in 1982) was the first blast furnace worldwide to be not just preserved, but actively refurbished for the purpose of preservation.

For 20th-century mass production blast furnaces, the degree of accurate preservation versus integration into new structures, or even re-purposing, differs between the various sites. Colorful illumination installations at night are common.

==List of preserved industrial mass production blast furnaces around the world==
These installations all date from the 20th century. They are supported by outer frames made of metal, were supplied with pre-heated blast air from external Cowper stoves, were typically part of large industrial compounds where, at one point, multiple blast furnaces were typically standing and operating side by side for efficiency reasons, raw materials were delivered by external elevating mechanisms, and the entire site was accessible by [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] which delivered the raw materials and carried off the freshly smelted [[pig iron]] in [[Ladle (metallurgy)|ladles]].

In many cases, the preserved sites have been deliberately stripped down to minimize maintenance costs; namely, some blast furnaces and related installations have been demolished. The goal was to only retain one or two blast furnaces including the relevant related installations (such as Cowper stoves, cast house, winch house etc.), which are considered sufficient to explain the blast furnace process and all related functions to visitors.

The first such decommissioned blast furnace that wasn't demolished and has been preserved to this very day stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]], and has ceased operation as early as 1968.

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

''World Futures'' 70/2 (2014): 120–39].&lt;/ref&gt; Others further argue that due to lack of food availability coupled with excessive pollution, developing countries show more evidence of the trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/197551/2/WP59.pdf|title=The Malthusian Trap and Development in Pre-Industrial Societies: A View Differing from the Standard One|last=Tisdell|first=Clem|date=1 January 2015|website=University of Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory. His essay, [[Tragedy of the commons|"The Tragedy of the Commons,"]] argued that "a finite world can support only a finite population" and that "freedom to breed will bring ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|year=1968|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|journal=Science|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Club of Rome]] published a famous book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UOcUZ9uquhEC&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking Nature Into Account: A Report to the Club of Rome |editor=Wouter van Dieren |year=1995 |publisher=Springer Books |isbn=978-0-387-94533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] is a prominent neo-Malthusian who first raised concerns in 1968 with the publication of ''[[The Population Bomb]]''.

On the other hand, in 2011 [[Andrey Korotayev]] and his colleagues suggested that the emergence of major sociopolitical upheavals at the escape from the Malthusian trap is not an abnormal, but a regular phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Korotayev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79t737gt |title=A Trap At The Escape From The Trap?

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==
{{See also|Industrial Revolution#Causes|British Agricultural Revolution}}
The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

{{Marxism|Sociology}}
'''Karl Marx's theory of alienation''' describes the [[social alienation|estrangement]] (''Entfremdung'') of people from aspects of their ''[[Marx's theory of human nature|Gattungswesen]]'' ("species-essence") as a consequence of living in a society of stratified [[social class]]es. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity.

The theoretic basis of alienation within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the [[bourgeoisie]]—who own the [[means of production]]—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of [[surplus value]] in the course of business competition among industrialists.

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), [[Karl Marx]] expressed the ''Entfremdung'' theory—of estrangement from the self.  Philosophically, the theory of ''Entfremdung'' relies upon ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] which states that the idea of a supernatural god has alienated the natural characteristics of the [[human being]]. Moreover, [[Max Stirner]] extended Feuerbach's analysis in ''[[The Ego and its Own]]'' (1845) that even the idea of "humanity" is an alienating concept for individuals to intellectually consider in its full philosophic implication. Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] responded to these philosophic propositions in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845).

== Types of alienation ==
In a capitalist society, the worker's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can only express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument, a thing and not a person. In the "Comment on James Mill" (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have, in two ways, affirmed himself, and the other person. (i) In my production I would have objectified my individuality, its specific character, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective, visible to the senses, and, hence, a power beyond all doubt. (ii) In your enjoyment, or use, of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work, that is, of having objectified man's essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man's essential nature [...] Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. "Comment on James Mill," ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'': 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), Marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system of industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;Alienation. ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'': Revised Second Edition (1984), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alienation of the worker from their product ===
The design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the [[capitalist class]] who besides accommodating the worker's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the [[engineer]] and the [[industrial designer]] who create the product in order to shape the [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol, alienation (''Entfremdung'') broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a [[use value]] (the product), into a commodity, which—like products—can be assigned an [[exchange value]]. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also [[Reification (Marxism)|reifies]] labour into the "concrete" concept of "work" (a job), for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist's [[investment capital]]; this is an aspect of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the [[Rentier capitalism|rentier capitalist]], who owns the means of production.

=== Alienation of the worker from the act of production === 
In the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for "a job well done". By means of [[commodification]], the [[labor power]] of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (''Entfremdung'') of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms; wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not "voluntary but coerced" (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of [[private property]] in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist. The worker "[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself"; "[l]abor is external to the worker" (p. 74), it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work "mortifies his body and ruins his mind". The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, "labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being (p. 74). A person's mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, "the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another" (p. 74). This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labor's form and direction belong to someone else.

=== Alienation of the worker from their ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence) === 
The ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence), human nature of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person. Conceptually, in the term "species-essence" the word "species" describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a "plurality of interests" and "psychological dynamism", whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as "the subject" and an idea of the thing that they produce, "the object". Conversely, unlike a human being an animal does not objectify itself as "the subject" nor its products as ideas, "the object", because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a [[Consciousness|conscious]] intention. Whereas a person's ''Gattungswesen'' (human nature) does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.

==== Relations of production ====
Whatever the character of a person's consciousness ([[Will (philosophy)|will]] and [[imagination]]), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon co-operation with others, thus, a person's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the [[means of production]]. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the [[relations of production]] of that ''status quo'' the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian [[feudalism]] superseded by [[mercantilism]], in turn superseded by the [[Industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the [[Technology|technologies]] (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') and the [[Value system|system of values]] of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged ''status quo'' of production-relations.

Despite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. Hence, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the [[relations of production]] to the [[means of production]]—from a [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to a [[communist mode of production]]. In the resultant [[communist society]], the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker's labour; the worker's humanity (species-essence) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated (see [[Marx's theory of human nature]]).

In the communist socio-economic organization, the relations of production would operate the [[mode of production]] and employ [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs]]. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, [[Wage slavery|minimal-wage]] "job" meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the [[Reification (Marxism)|objectified]] productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.

=== Alienation of the worker from other workers === 
Capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial [[commodity]] that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the [[means of production]] establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The capitalist economy's arrangement of the [[relations of production]] provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for "higher wages", thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a [[false consciousness]], which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist [[bourgeoisie]] through its [[cultural hegemony]]. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of [[religion]] in justifying the [[relations of production]] facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation (''Entfremdung'') of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being "[[opiate of the people|the opiate of the masses]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s3002.htm Marx on Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical significance ==
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|250px|Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) postulated the [[idealism]] that Marx countered with [[dialectical materialism]]]]

===  Influences: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach ===
In [[Marxist theory]], ''Entfremdung'' ([[social alienation|alienation]]) is a foundational proposition about man's progress towards [[self-actualisation]]. In the ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich described the influences of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] upon Karl Marx: &lt;blockquote&gt;For Hegel, the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself, separated from its "essence", which it has placed in a "beyond".&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

As used by the philosophers Hegel and Marx, the reflexive German verbs ''entäussern'' ("to divest one's self of") and ''entfremden'' ("to become estranged") indicate that the term "alienation" denotes self-alienation: to be estranged from one's essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Langenscheidt New College Dictionary'': German–English/English–German (1973) pp. 166 and 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, alienation is a lack of self-worth, the absence of meaning in one's life, consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment, without the opportunity to become actualized, to become one's [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted. ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge, of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel's human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of [[idealism]]—"spiritual ignorance" and "self-understanding"—are replaced with [[materialism|material categories]], whereby "spiritual ignorance" becomes "alienation" and "self-understanding" becomes man's realisation of his ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence).

==== ''Entfremdung'' and the theory of history ====
{{see also|Marx's theory of history|Dialectical materialism}}
In Part I: "Feuerbach – Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook" of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), Karl Marx said the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The German Ideology|date= Fall 1845 to mid-1846|chapter=Part I: Feuerbach. Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their [[self-actualisation]] as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] eventually will [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] and impoverish the [[proletariat]] until compelling them to [[social revolution]] for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of [[Marxist humanism]]. In ''The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism'' (1992), [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] discussed and described the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.

==== ''Entfremdung'' and social class ====
In Chapter 4 of ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each [[social class]] experiences alienation in a different form: &lt;blockquote&gt;The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power, and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch04.htm Chapter 4 of ''The Holy Family'']- see under Critical Comment No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
In discussion of "random materialism" (''matérialisme aléatoire''), the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] criticized such a [[teleology|teleological]] (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation because it rendered the [[proletariat]] as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] of history; an interpretation tainted with the [[Hegelian idealism]] of the "philosophy of the subject", which he criticized as the "bourgeois ideology of philosophy" (see ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' [1923] by [[György Lukács]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alienation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24939">The '''Older Dryas''' was a [[stadial]] (cold) period between the [[Bølling oscillation|Bølling]] and [[Allerød oscillation|Allerød]] [[interstadial]]s (warmer phases), about 14,000 years [[Before Present]]), towards the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Its date is not well defined, with estimates varying by 400 years, but its duration is agreed to have been around 200 years.

The gradual warming since the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (27,000 to 24,000 years BP) has been interrupted by two cold spells: the Older Dryas and the [[Younger Dryas]] (c. 12,900-11,650 BP). In northern [[Scotland]], the glaciers were thicker and deeper during the Older Dryas than the succeeding Younger Dryas, and there is no evidence of human occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Palaeolithic: Human Societies at the Edge of the Pleistocene World|first1=Paul|last1=Pettit|first2=Mark|last2=White|pages=374 477|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-67455-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northwestern Europe]] was also an earlier [[Oldest Dryas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Allaby|title=Oxford Dictionary of Geology &amp; Earth Sciences|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=181|year=2013|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-19-965306-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dryas are named after an indicator genus, the Arctic and Alpine plant [[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]], the remains of which are found in higher concentrations in deposits from colder periods.

The Older Dryas was a variable cold, dry [[Blytt-Sernander]] period, observed in climatological evidence in only some regions, depending on latitude. In regions in which it is not observed, the Bølling-Allerød is considered a single interstadial period. Evidence of the Older Dryas is strongest in northern Eurasia, particularly part of Northern [[Prehistoric Europe|Europe]], roughly equivalent to [[Pollen zone]] Ic.

==Dates==
In the [[Greenland]] oxygen isotope record, the Older Dryas appears as a downward peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød. That configuration presents a difficulty in estimating its time, as it is more of a point than a segment. The segment is small enough to escape the resolution of most carbon-14 series, as the points are not close enough together to find the segment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.full Perry, Charles A., Hsu, Kenneth A.; Geophysical, archaeological, and historical evidence support a solar-output model for climate change]. Section: Model Timeline Calibration, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to the problem assigns a point and then picks an arbitrary segment. The Older Dryas is sometimes considered to be "centered" near 14,100 BP or to be 100 to 150 years long "at" 14,250 BP.

A second approach finds carbon-14 or other dates as close to the end of the Bølling and the beginning of the Allerød as possible and then selects endpoints that based on them: for example, 14,000-13,700 BP.

The best approach attempts to include the Older Dryas in a sequence of points as close together as possible (high resolution) or within a known event.

For example, pollen from the island of [[Hokkaidō]], [[Japan]], records a [[Larix]] pollen peak and matching [[sphagnum]] decline at 14,600-13700 BP. In the [[White Sea]], a cooling occurred at 14,700-13,400/13,000, which resulted in a re-advance of the glacier in the initial Allerød. In [[Canada]], the [[Shulie Lake]] phase, a re-advance, is dated to 14,000-13,500 BP. On the other hand, [[varve]] chronology in southern [[Sweden]] indicates a range of 14,050-13,900 BP.&lt;ref&gt;Edwige Pons-Branchu, Climatic control on speleothems growth. High precision U/Th dating of speleothems from South and East of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capturing the Older Dryas by high resolution continues to be of interest to climatologists.

==Description==
[[Northern Europe]] offered an alternation of [[steppe]] and [[tundra]] environments depending on the [[permafrost]] line and the [[latitude]]. In moister regions, around lakes and streams, were thickets of [[dwarf birch]], [[willow]], [[sea buckthorn]], and [[juniper]]. In the river valleys and uplands, to the south, were open [[birch]] forests.

The first trees, birch and [[pine]], had spread into Northern Europe 500 years earlier. During the Older Dryas, the glacier re-advanced, and the trees retreated southward, to be replaced by a mixture of grassland and cool-weather alpine species. The [[biome]] has been called "[[Park Tundra]]," "Arctic tundra," "Arctic pioneer vegetation," or “birch woodlands." It is now in the transition between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]] in [[Siberia]]. Then, it stretched from Siberia to [[Great Britain]], in a more-or-less unbroken expanse.

To the northwest was the [[Baltic ice lake]], which was truncated by the edge of the glacier. Species had access to [[Denmark]] and southern Sweden. Most of [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic countries]] were under the ice or the lake for most of the period. Northern [[Scandinavia]] was glaciated. Between Britain and the [[Continental Europe]] were rolling hills prolifically populated with animals. Thousands of specimens, hundreds of tons of bones, have been recovered from the bottom of the [[North Sea]], called "[[Doggerland]]," and they continue to be recovered.

There are many more species found for the period than in this article. Most families were more diverse than they are today, and they were yet more so in the last interglacial. A great [[extinction]], especially of mammals, continued throughout the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and it may be continuing today.

== Evidence ==
The Older Dryas is a period of cooling during the [[Bølling-Allerød warming]], estimated to be from 13,900 to 13,600 years before present (BP),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klitgaard-Kristensen|first=Dorthe|last2=Sejrup|first2=H.

Numerous studies on chronology and palaeoclimate of last deglaciation show a cooling event within [[Bølling-Allerød warming]] that reflects the occurrence of Older Dryas. The determination of paleotemperatures varies from study to study depending on the sample collected. [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="interstadial"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements are most common when analyzing Ice core samples whereas the changing abundance pattern of fauna and flora are most commonly used when examining lake sediments. Moraine belts are usually studied in places with palaeoglacier presented.

=== Lake sediment evidence ===
A multi-proxy study on late glacial lake sediments of Moervaart palaeolake shows multiple pieces of evidence in various aspects to support Older Dryas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J. A.|date=2017|others=et al.|title=Multiple oscillations during the Lateglacial as recorded in a multi-proxy, high-resolution record of the Moervaart palaeolake (NW Belgium)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379117300148|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=162|pages=|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake sediment had an erosional surface prior to Older Dryas suggesting a change to colder climate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Microstructure observation of the sediments shows that fossil soil wedges or frost cracks were observed in the top of Older Dryas deposits,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which indicates mean annual air temperatures below -1 to 0 ℃ and cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maarleveld|first=G.C.|date=1976|title=Periglacial phenomena and the mean annual temperature during the last glacial time in The Netherlands|url=|journal=Biuletyn Peryglacjalny|volume=26|pages=57–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion is also supported by the presence of ''[[Juniper]]us'', which indicates a protecting snow cover in winter. This change is also shown on the records at the Rieme sites on the Great SandRidge of Maldegem-Stekene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=J.

[[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] measurements show a decreasing trend in [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup href="Greenland"&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] at the transition to the Older Dryas, which corresponds to the ice core record of precipitation in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pollen analysis shows a temporary decrease in the pollen levels of trees and shrubs with a short-term increase of herbaceous pollen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changed pollen pattern suggests an increased abundance of grass as well as a retreat of tree and shrubs. The change of vegetation distribution further indicates a colder and drier climate during this period. As for aquatic plant evidence, both aquatic and semi-aquatic botanical taxa show a sharp decrease, suggesting lower lake levels caused by drier climate. The drier climate is also reflected by increased salinity indicated by diatom analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The change of Chironomids population also indicates a colder climate. ''Microtendipes'' is an indicator of intermediate temperature in Late glacial deposits in northern Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Stephen J.|last2=Birks|first2=H.J.B|date=2001|title=Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Lateglacial and Holocene sites in north-west Europe: Progress and problems|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0277-3791(01)00038-5|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=20|issue=16-17|pages=1723–1741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Brooks and Birks, 2001).  The abundance of ''Microtendipes'' peaked in the early part of Older Dryas suggesting a cold oscillation. The mollusc data (''[[Valvata piscinalis]]'' as a cold-water indicator) suggests a lower summer temperature comparing to previous Bølling period.

=== Ocean sediment evidence ===
Recent research on sea surface temperature (SST) for the past 15,000 years in southern Okinawa modelled the Paleoclimate of ocean sediment core (ODP 1202B) using an alkenone analysis.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt; The results show a cooing stage at 14,300 to 13,700 years BP between [[Bølling-Allerød warming|Bølling and Allerød warm phases]], corresponding to the Older Dryas event.&lt;ref name="ruan" /&gt;

Another study on an ocean sediment core from Norwegian Trench also suggests a cooling between Bølling and Allerød warm phases.

=== Moraine evidence ===
The study on late-glacial climate change in White Mountains (New Hampshire, USA) refined the deglaciation history of White Mountain Moraine System (WMMS) by mapping moraine belts and related lake sequences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Woodrow B.|last2=Dorion|first2=Christopher C.|last3=Ridge|first3=John C.|last4=Balco|first4=Greg|last5=Fowler|first5=Brian K.|last6=Svendsen|first6=Kristen M.|date=Jan 2017|title=Deglaciation and late-glacial climate change in the White Mountains, New Hampshire, USA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/div-classtitledeglaciation-and-late-glacial-climate-change-in-the-white-mountains-new-hampshire-usadiv/DE8663330CE11C8484FAA0C6DD29DDD1|journal=Quaternary Research|language=en|volume=87|issue=1|pages=96–120|doi=10.1017/qua.2016.4|issn=0033-5894|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result suggests that the Littleton-Bethlehem (L-B) readvance of ice sheet occurred between 14,000 to 13,800 years BP. The L-B readvance coincided with the Older Dryas events and provides the first well-documented and dated evidence of Older Dryas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Another Glacial chronology and palaeoclimate study on moraine suggests a cold oscillation in the second late-glacial (LG2) following the first late-glacial readvance (LG1) at around 14,000±700 to 13,700±1200 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makos|first=M|last2=Rinterknecht,V.; Braucher, R.; Żarnowski, M.; Team, A.|date=2016-02-15|title=Glacial chronology and palaeoclimate in the Bystra catchment, Western Tatra Mountains (Poland) during the Late Pleistocene|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116300063|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=134|pages=74–91|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.01.004|issn=0277-3791|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LG2 cold oscillation around 14,000 years BP can correspond to the cooling of Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1d-Older Dryas)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that happened around the same time period, which is the first chronological evidence that supports the presence of Older Dryas in the Tatra Mountains.

==Flora==
Older Dryas species are usually found in sediment below the bottom layer of the bog. Indicator species are the Alpine plants:
:*''[[Betula pubescens]]'' or downy birch (Central Europe);
:*''[[Pinaceae]]'' or pine family (Poland);
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', or dryas;
:*''[[Salix herbacea]]'', or dwarf willow;
:*''[[Oxyria digyna]]'', or mountain sorrel.

Grasslands species are the following: 
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'', sagebrush or wormwood;
:*''[[Ephedra]]'', or joint-fir.
:*''[[Hippophae]]''

==Fauna==
A well-stocked biozone prevailed on the Arctic plains and thickets of the Late Pleistocene. Plains mammals were most predominant:

[[Even-toed ungulate|Artiodactyls]]:
:*''[[Bison priscus]]'', the steppe wisent or steppe bison 
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', the reindeer or caribou
:*''[[Irish elk|Megaloceros giganteus]]'', the Irish elk
:*''[[Moose|Alces alces]]'', the elk
:*''[[Red deer|Cervus elaphus]]'', the red deer
:*''[[Musk ox|Ovibos moschatus]]'', the musk ox
:*''[[Saiga|Saiga tatarica]]'', the saiga
[[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyls]]:
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', the wild horse. Many authors refer to it as ''Equus caballus'', but the latter term is most correctly reserved for the domestic horse. Ferus is presumed to be one or more ancestral or related stocks to caballus and has been described as "caballine".
:*''[[Wooly rhinoceros|Coelodonta antiquitatis]]'', woolly rhinoceros
[[Proboscidea]]:
:*''[[Mammoth|Mammuthus primigenius]]'', the woolly mammoth

So much meat on the hoof must have supported large numbers of [[Carnivora]]:
[[Ursidae]]:
:*''[[Brown bear|Ursus arctos]]'', the brown bear
:*''[[Cave bear|Ursus spelaeus]]'', the cave bear
[[Hyaenidae]]:
:*''[[Hyena|Crocuta crocuta]]'', the spotted hyena
[[Felidae]]:
:*''[[Panthera leo spelaea|Panthera spelaea]]'', the cave lion
[[Canidae]]:
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', the wolf
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', the Arctic fox
[[Mustelidae]]:
:*''[[Wolverine|Gulo gulo]]'', the wolverine

The sea also had its share of carnivores; their maritime location made them survive until modern times:
[[Phocidae]]:
:*''[[Harp seal|Pagophilus groenlandica]]'', the harp seal
:*''[[Ringed seal|Pusa hispida]]'', the ringed seal
[[Odobenidae]]:
:*''[[Walrus|Odobenus rosmarus]]'', the walrus
Of the [[Cetacea]]n [[Odontoceti]], the [[Monodontidae]]:
:*''[[Beluga (whale)|Delphinapterus leucas]]'', the beluga
[[Delphinidae]]:
:*''[[Orca|Orcinus orca]]'', the killer whale
Of the [[Mysticeti]]an [[Eschrichtiidae]]:
:*''[[Gray whale|Eschrictius robustus]]'', the gray whale

The top of the food chain was supported by larger numbers of smaller animals farther down, which lived in the herbaceous blanket covering the tundra or steppe and helped maintain it by carrying seeds, manuring and aerating it.

[[Leporidae]]:
:*''[[Hare|Lepus tanaiticus]]'', the hare
[[Ochotonidae]]:
:*''[[Pika|Ochotona spelaeus]]'', the pika
[[Cricetidae]]:
:*''[[Lemming|Lemmus obensis]]'', Siberian lemming
:*''[[Lemming|Dicrostonix]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Steppe lemming|Lagurus lagurus]]'', steppe lemming
:*''[[Microtus|Microtus gregalis]]'', narrow-headed vole
:*''[[European water vole|Arvicola terrestris]]'', water vole
[[Sciuridae]]:
:*''[[Spermophilus]]'', ground squirrel
[[Dipodidae]]:
:*''[[Allactaga|Allactaga jaculus]]'', the jerboa

==Humans==
Eurasia was populated by ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' ([[European early modern humans|Cro-Magnon man]]) during the late [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Bands of humans survived by hunting the mammals of the plains. In [[Northern Europe]] they preferred reindeer, in [[Ukraine]] the [[woolly mammoth]]. They sheltered in huts and manufactured tools around campfires. Ukrainian shelters were supported by mammoth tusks. Humans were already established across [[Siberia]] and in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palaeolithic.dk/books/JAS_39/excerpt.pdf Eriksen, Berit Valentin; Reconsidering the geochronological framework of Lateglacial hunter-gatherer colonization of southern Scandinavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two domestic dogs (''[[Canis familiaris]]'') have been found in late Pleistocene Ukraine and were a heavy breed, similar to a [[Great Dane]], perhaps useful to run down [[Elephantidae]]. The large number of mammoth bones at campsites make it clear that even then, the Elephantidae in Europe were approaching the limit of their duration. Their bones were used for many purposes, one being the numerous objects of art, including an engraved star map.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Late Upper Palaeolithic culture was by no means uniform. Many local traditions have been defined. The [[Hamburgian culture]] had occupied the lowlands and Northern Germany before the Older Dryas. During the Older Dryas, contemporaneous with the Havelte Group of the late Hamburgian, the [[Federmesser culture]] appeared and occupied Denmark and southern Sweden, following the reindeer. South of the Hamburgian was the longstanding [[Magdalenian]]. In Ukraine was the Moldovan, which used tusks to build shelters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13828">A '''prosopographical network''' is a system which represents a historical group made up by individual actors and their interactions within a delimited spatial and temporal range. The [[network science]] methodology offers an alternative way of analyzing the patterns of relationships, composition and activities of people studied in their own historical context. Since [[prosopography]] examines the whole of a past society, its individuals who made it up, and its structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosopofraphy Centre|title=PROSOPOGRAPHY: DEFINITION|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~prosop/prosopdefinition.htm|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this independent science of social history uses a collective study of biographies of a well-defined group, in a multiple career analysis,&lt;ref&gt;"multiple career-line analysis (as the social scientists call it)", Lawrence Stone remarked, in "Prosopography", ''Daedalus'' '''100'''.1 (1971), pp 46&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt; for collecting and interpreting relevant quantities of data, these same set of data can be employed for constructing a network of the studied group. Prosopographical network studies have emerged as a young and dynamic field in historical research; nevertheless, the category of prosopographical network is in its formative, initial phase and as a consequence it is hard to view as a stable and defined notion in [[history]] and beyond [[social network analysis]]. See also [[narrative network]].

== Overview ==
With the advent of the study of [[complex systems]], [[graph theory]] provides analysts of historical groups and collective lives with relatively simple tools for answering questions such as: how many [[Degree (graph theory)|degrees of separation]] on average separate all members of the ''prosopographical group''? Which historical character is connected to the most other members of the studied range? How densely or loosely connected was the group as a whole? Such questions hold a natural interest for prosopographers, who can then begin to look for certain characteristics –class, office, occupation, gender, faction, ethnic background – and identify patterns of [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] that they might have otherwise missed when confronted with a mass of data too large for normal synthetic approaches. The concepts and methods of social network analysis in historical research are recently being used not only as a mere metaphor but are increasingly applied in practice

== Background ==
The analysis and interpretation of prosopographical networks is an interdisciplinary field of study in [[social studies]] and [[humanities]]. This field emerged from [[philology]], history, genealogical studies, and sociology and [[social network analysis]]. The term "prosopography" comes from the word ''prosopoeia'', a figure in classical [[rhetoric]] in which an imagined person is figured and represented as if present. [[Claude Nicolet]] defined the main of prosopography as the history of groups as elements in political and social history, achieved by isolating series of persons having certain political or social characteristics in common and then analyzing each series in terms of multiple criteria, in order both to obtain information specific to individuals and to identify the constants and the variables among the data for whole groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=KOENRAAD VERBOVEN |author2=MYRIAM CARLIER |author3=JAN DUMOLYN  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Short Manual to the Art of Prosopography|url=http://prosopography.modhist.ox.ac.uk/images/01%20Verboven%20pdf.pdf|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Lawrence Stone]], prosopography had become a two-fold tool for historical research: 1) it helps to unveil interests and connections hidden or unclear in the narrative (i.e. [[rhetoric]], [[historiography]], etc.), and 2) it allows analysing the shifting roles in a community and the changing composition of society though [[genealogy]], legal-institutional position, and inter-personal relations. For both uses, understanding connections and studying the evolution of a group, network analysis presents a helpful and feasible methodological framework for measuring quantities and interpreting data. By applying the methods of [[social network analysis]], the approaches of prosopography can be quantified, graphed, and assessed. Together with other [[complex system]]s studies, prosopographical networks form part of the field of [[network science]].

In the field of historical studies, the term network has been used in a metaphorical sense alone for a long time. The sociological focus, despite the vast spectrum of tools and methods at its disposal, does not deal with limited extraction of relational data from fragmentary and even contradictory sources. Along with the paucity of sources, this hampers the comprehensive, valid and meaningful application of methods drawn from [[social network analysis]]. Despite these obstacles, the relational perspective of network analysis has helped historical research and prosopography to gain an entirely new methodological vantage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Historical Network Research|title=HNR Website|year=2011|url=https://sites.google.com/site/historicalnetworkresearch/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social network theory may be able to overcome conceptual and epistemological difficulties presented by historical objects of study and historical sources. Constructing a prosopographical network can offer an alternative, more fluid interpretation of communities in the past, which allows us to take account of coexisting, sometimes overlapping, networks of different sources and geographical delimitations.

*Josie M. Abbott used prosopography to construct a ''group'' biography of women secretarial workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in ''The Angel in the Office ''(2009).
*Sociologist Michael Erben explored the use of prosopography to investigate what might be called a ''street biography'' in "A Preliminary Prosopography of the Victorian Street", (1996). Sourced mainly from census records, the data used included not only the demography but also the spatial classifications, occupations, and domestic arrangements of a street in Victorian [[Oxford, England|Oxford]]. This material forms what Erben describes as an Unaffiliated or Disinterested Group, i.e.  spatial locale may be all inhabitants had in common, unlike Intentional Groups, with explicit shared interests, found in more traditional prosopography.  The work shows that such Unaffiliated Groups can yield much information on subjects such as social mobility in a given place and time.
*Debra Nails compiled a prosopography of [[Plato]] and other Socratics by exploring the biographies of each person mentioned in the Socratic literature in an attempt to explore how [[Socrates]] interacted with others. [[Plato]] mentions many contemporaries of [[Socrates]], from political figures to [[sophists]], often using them as characters in the dialogs and foils for his criticism.
*Building on initial work of Robert Hartwell, [[Peter Bol]] (Harvard), Michael Fuller (UC Irvine), [[Deng Xiaonan]] (Peking University), and Lau Nap-yin (academia Sinica) launched the [[China Biographical Database]] project in 2005 as an online and stand-alone relational database of the careers, kinship, associations, writings, and other data of Chinese men and women, mainly from the 7th century into the early 20th. CBDB exports query results in formats for statistical, network analsys and GIS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10716">The [[wikt:triad|triad]] '''thesis, antithesis, synthesis''' ({{lang-de|These, Antithese, Synthese}}; originally:&lt;ref name=Fichte/&gt; ''Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis'') is often used to describe the thought of [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]] (1986), ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford UP, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel never used the term himself. It originated with [[Johann Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between the three abstract terms of the triad, also known as the [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical method]], is summarized in the following way in the ''Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hegel's Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis Model |pages=978 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8265-8_200183 |last1=Schnitker |first1=Sarah A. |last2=Emmons |first2=Robert A. |isbn=978-1-4020-8264-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) a beginning proposition called a thesis, (2) a negation of that thesis called the antithesis, and (3) a synthesis whereby the two conflicting ideas are reconciled to form a new proposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History of the idea==
[[Thomas McFarland]] (2002), in his ''Prolegomena'' to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''Opus Maximum'',&lt;ref name=STC&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge: ''Opus Maximum''. Princeton University Press, 2002, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Kritik der reinen Vernunft]]'' (1781) as the genesis of the thesis/antithesis dyad.  Kant concretises his ideas into:
* Thesis: "The world has a beginning in time, and is limited with regard to space."
* Antithesis: "The world has no beginning and no limits in space, but is infinite, in respect to both time and space."

Inasmuch as conjectures like these can be said to be resolvable, [[Fichte]]'s ''Grundlage der gesamten Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794) resolved Kant's dyad by synthesis, posing the question thus:&lt;ref name=STC/&gt;

* ''Are synthetic judgments a priori possible?''
** No synthesis is possible without a preceding antithesis.  As little as antithesis without synthesis, or synthesis without antithesis, is possible; just as little possible are both without thesis.
Fichte employed the triadic idea "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" as a formula for the explanation of change.&lt;ref name=Ritter&gt;[[Harry Ritter]], ''Dictionary of Concepts in History''. Greenwood Publishing Group (1986), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Fichte was the first to use the trilogy of words together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robert R.|title=Recognition: Fichte and Hegel on the Other|date=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|page=46, note 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Grundriss des Eigentümlichen der Wissenschaftslehre, in Rücksicht auf das theoretische Vermögen'' (1795, ''Outline of the Distinctive Character of the Wissenschaftslehre with respect to the Theoretical Faculty''): "Die jetzt aufgezeigte Handlung ist '''thetisch, antithetisch und synthetisch''' zugleich." ["The action here described is simultaneously thetic, antithetic, and synthetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichte|first1=Johann Gottlieb|last2=Breazeale|first2=Daniel|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

Still according to McFarland, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] then, in his ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie'' (1795), arranged the terms schematically in pyramidal form.

According to [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), although the triad is often thought to form part of an [[analysis]] of historical and philosophical progress called the Hegelian [[dialectic]], the assumption is erroneous:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Walter Kaufmann|authorlink= Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|title= Hegel: A Reinterpretation|year= 1966|publisher= [[Anchor Books]]|chapter= § 37|isbn= 978-0-268-01068-3|oclc= 3168016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whoever looks for the stereotype of the allegedly Hegelian dialectic in Hegel's ''Phenomenology'' will not find it. What one does find on looking at the table of contents is a very decided preference for triadic arrangements. ... But these many triads are not presented or deduced by Hegel as so many theses, antitheses, and syntheses. It is not by means of any dialectic of that sort that his thought moves up the ladder to '''[[absolute knowledge]]'''.}}

[[Gustav E. Mueller]] (1958) concurs that Hegel was not a proponent of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, and clarifies what the concept of dialectic might have meant in Hegel's thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mueller|first1=Gustav|title=The Hegel Legend of "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis"|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|date=1958|volume=19|issue=4|pages=411–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Dialectic" does not for Hegel mean "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis." Dialectic means that any "ism" – which has a polar opposite, or is a special viewpoint leaving "the rest" to itself – must be criticized by the logic of philosophical thought, whose problem is reality as such, the "World-itself".}}

According to Mueller, the attribution of this tripartite dialectic to Hegel is the result of "inept reading" and simplistic translations which do not take into account the genesis of Hegel's terms: 
{{quote|Hegel's greatness is as indisputable as his obscurity. The matter is due to his peculiar terminology and style; they are undoubtedly involved and complicated, and seem excessively abstract. These linguistic troubles, in turn, have given rise to legends which are like perverse and magic spectacles - once you wear them, the text simply vanishes. Theodor Haering's monumental and standard work has for the first time cleared up the linguistic problem. By carefully analyzing every sentence from his early writings, which were published only in this century, he has shown how Hegel's terminology evolved - though it was complete when he began to publish. Hegel's contemporaries were immediately baffled, because what was clear to him was not clear to his readers, who were not initiated into the genesis of his terms.

An example of how a legend can grow on inept reading is this: Translate "Begriff" by "concept," "Vernunft" by "reason" and "Wissenschaft" by "science" – and they are all good dictionary translations – and you have transformed the great critic of rationalism ''and'' irrationalism into a ridiculous champion of an absurd pan-logistic rationalism and scientism.

The most vexing and devastating Hegel legend is that everything is thought in "thesis, antithesis, and synthesis."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller 1958, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) adopted and extended the triad, especially in Marx's ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847). Here, in Chapter 2, Marx is obsessed by the word "thesis";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm marxists.org: Chapter 2 of "The Poverty of Philosophy", by Karl Marx]&lt;/ref&gt; it forms an important part of the basis for the [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist theory of history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://scholarworks.uni.edu/mtie/vol11/iss1/5/|title=The Validity of Karl Marx's Theory of Historical Materialism|journal=Major Themes in Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=35–56|last=Shrimp|first=Kaleb|date=2009|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing pedagogy==
{{See also|Rogerian argument}}
In modern times, the dialectic of ''thesis, antithesis, and synthesis'' has been implemented across the world as a strategy for organizing expositional writing. For example, this technique is taught as a basic organizing principle in French schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nadeau|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Barlow|first2=Julie|title=Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong: Why We Love France But Not The French|date=2003|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The French learn to value and practice eloquence from a young age. Almost from day one, students are taught to produce plans for their compositions, and are graded on them. The structures change with fashions. Youngsters were once taught to express a progression of ideas. Now they follow a dialectic model of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. If you listen carefully to the French arguing about any topic they all follow this model closely: they present an idea, explain possible objections to it, and then sum up their conclusions. ... This analytical mode of reasoning is integrated into the entire school corpus.}}

Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis has also been used as a basic scheme to organize writing in the English language. For example, the website WikiPreMed.com advocates the use of this scheme in writing timed essays for the MCAT standardized test:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MCAT writing assignment.|url=http://www.wikipremed.com/mcat_essay.php|website=WikiPreMed|publisher=Wisebridge Learning Systems, LLC|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For the purposes of writing MCAT essays, the dialectic describes the progression of ideas in a critical thought process that is the force driving your argument. A good dialectical progression propels your arguments in a way that is satisfying to the reader.

:The thesis is an intellectual proposition.
:The antithesis is a critical perspective on the thesis.
:The synthesis solves the conflict between the thesis and antithesis by reconciling their common truths, and forming a new proposition. }}

'''''The Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites''''' is a set of guidelines, drawn up in 1964 by a group of conservation professionals in Venice, that provides an international framework for the [[conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and [[Building restoration|restoration]] of historic buildings.&lt;ref name="Erder" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/erder.pdf |title=Erdem, C. The Venice Charter under Review. (1977). Ankara. |format=PDF |date= March 1977 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the document is now seen as outdated, representing Modernist views opposed to reconstruction. Reconstruction is now cautiously accepted by UNESCO in exceptional circumstances if it seeks to reflect a pattern of use or cultural practice that sustains cultural value, and is based on complete documentation without reliance on conjecture. The change in attitude can be marked by the reconstruction in 2015 of the Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World Heritage Site in Mali after their destruction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Christina''Reconstruction: changing attitudes'', UNESCO[https://en.unesco.org/courier/july-september-2017/reconstruction-changing-attitudes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic background==

===Athens Charter===
The development of new conservation and restoration techniques have threatened the historic buildings in a general sense.&lt;ref name="hx" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/history.pdf |title=ICOMOS. (2004). The History of the Venice Charter. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the International Museum Office organized a meeting of specialists about the conservation of historic buildings. The conference resulted with the [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]] for the Restoration of Historic Monuments. This consisted of a manifesto of seven points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icomos.org/index.php/en/charters-and-texts?id=167:the-athens-charter-for-the-restoration-of-historic-monuments&amp;catid=179:charters-and-standards |title=The Athens Charter for the Restoration of Historic Monuments.

* to establish organizations for restoration advice
* to ensure projects are reviewed with knowledgeable criticism
* to establish national legislation to preserve historic sites
* to rebury excavations which were not to be restored.
* to allow the use of modern techniques and materials in restoration work.
* to place historical sites under custodial protection.
* to protect the area surrounding historic sites.

The Athens Charter proposed the idea of a common world heritage, the importance of the setting of monuments, and the principle of the integration of new materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/research_resources/charters/charter02.html|title= The GETTY Conservation Institute. Cultural Heritage Policy Documents: General Conclusions of the Athens Conference 1931 |format=Web page |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter had very progressive suggestions for its period, influencing the creation of conservation institutions, as well as the eventual Venice Charter.

===First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
With the concern that listing and safeguarding historic buildings was not enough, in 1957 architectural specialists arranged a congress in Paris called The First International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings. At its conclusion, the congress published seven recommendations:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
# the countries which still lack a central organization for the protection of historic buildings provide for the establishment of such an authority,
# the creation of an international assembly of architects and specialists of historic buildings should be considered,
# a specialized professional training of all categories of personnel should be promoted so as to secure highly qualified workmanship and that remuneration should be commensurate with such qualifications,
# the hygrometric problems relating to historic buildings should be discussed in a symposium,
# contemporary artists should be requested to contribute to the decoration of monuments,
# close cooperation should be established among architects and archeologists,
# architects and town-planners cooperate so as to secure integration of historic buildings into town planning.

The Congress agreed to have its second meeting in Venice and Piero Gazzola, who was to serve as the chairman of the Venice Charter, was invited to hold the Venice Congress.&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

===Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings===
In 1964, at the Second International Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, 13 resolutions were adopted of which the first was the Venice Charter and the second was creation of [[ICOMOS|ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites)]].&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;

The Venice Charter consisted of seven main titles and sixteen articles. The concept of historic monuments and sites was interpreted as the common heritage, therefore safeguarding them for the future generations with authenticity was defined as the common responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/publications/hommedecin.pdf|title= IInd International Congress of Architects and Technicians of Historic Monuments Committee. (1964). Decisions and Resolutions. Venice. |format=PDF |date= 1964-03-31|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text is the original 1964 text agreed on by the representatives of the participating [[nation]]s mentioned at the end of the [[Charter]].

==Venice Charter Text==

===Definitions===
'''Article 1.''' The concept of a historic monument embraces not only the single architectural work but also the urban or rural setting in which is found the evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. This applies not only to great works of art but also to more modest works of the past which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.

'''Article 2.''' The conservation and restoration of monuments must have recourse to all the sciences and techniques which can contribute to the study and safeguarding of the architectural heritage.

===Aim===
'''Article 3.''' The intention in conserving and restoring monuments is to safeguard them no less as works of art than as historical evidence.

===Conservation===
'''Article 4.''' It is essential to the conservation of monuments that they be maintained on a permanent basis.

'''Article 5.''' The conservation of monuments is always facilitated by making use of them for some socially useful purpose. Such use is therefore desirable but it must not change the lay-out or decoration of the building. It is within these limits only that modifications demanded by a change of function should be envisaged and may be permitted.

'''Article 6.''' The conservation of a monument implies preserving a setting which is not out of scale. Wherever the traditional setting exists, it must be kept. No new construction, demolition or modification which would alter the relations of mass and color must be allowed.

'''Article 7.''' A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance.

'''Article 8.''' Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed from it if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation.

===Restoration===
'''Article 9.''' The process of restoration is a highly specialized operation. Its aim is to preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents. It must stop at the point where conjecture begins, and in this case moreover any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and must bear a contemporary stamp. The restoration in any case must be preceded and followed by an archaeological and historical study of the monument.

'''Article 10.''' Where traditional techniques prove inadequate, the consolidation of a monument can be achieved by the use of any modern technique for conservation and construction, the efficacy of which has been shown by scientific data and proved by experience.

'''Article 11.''' The valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected, since unity of style is not the aim of a restoration. When a building includes the superimposed work of different periods, the revealing of the underlying state can only be justified in exceptional circumstances and when what is removed is of little interest and the material which is brought to light is of great historical, archaeological or aesthetic value, and its state of preservation good enough to justify the action. Evaluation of the importance of the elements involved and the decision as to what may be destroyed cannot rest solely on the individual in charge of the work.

'''Article 12.''' Replacements of missing parts must integrate harmoniously with the whole, but at the same time must be distinguishable from the original so that restoration does not falsify the artistic or historic evidence.

'''Article 13.''' Additions cannot be allowed except in so far as they do not detract from the interesting parts of the building, its traditional setting, the balance of its composition and its relation with its surroundings.

===Historic Sites===
'''Article 14.''' The sites of monuments must be the object of special care in order to safeguard their integrity and ensure that they are cleared and presented in a seemly manner. The work of conservation and restoration carried out in such places should be inspired by the principles set forth in the foregoing articles.

===Excavations===
'''Article 15.''' Excavations should be carried out in accordance with scientific standards and the recommendation defining international principles to be applied in the case of archaeological excavation adopted by UNESCO in 1956.
Ruins must be maintained and measures necessary for the permanent conservation and protection of architectural features and of objects discovered must be taken. Furthermore, every means must be taken to facilitate the understanding of the monument and to reveal it without ever distorting its meaning.

All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori." Only anastylosis, that is to say, the reassembling of existing but dismembered parts can be permitted. The material used for integration should always be recognizable and its use should be the least that will ensure the conservation of a monument and the reinstatement of its form.

===Publication===
'''Article 16.''' In all works of preservation, restoration or excavation, there should always be precise documentation in the form of analytical and critical reports, illustrated with drawings and photographs. Every stage of the work of clearing, consolidation, rearrangement and integration, as well as technical and formal features identified during the course of the work, should be included. This record should be placed in the archives of a public institution and made available to research workers. It is recommended that the report should be published.

== Outcome ==
The Venice Charter is the most influential document on conservation since 1964. However the following aspects are not covered in the Venice Charter:&lt;ref name="hx" /&gt;
* The concept of site which also applies to historic landscapes and gardens
* The concept of reversibility in restoration
* The social and financial issues

In the years after the publishing, the purpose of the charter a number of symposiums took place in order to improve common understandings and awareness of it by those involved in the conservation and restoration works of the historic buildings. How it was applied in different countries varied according to their social, economic and cultural conditions, as well as the technical qualifications of those applying it.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt; Translation mistakes and misunderstandings of the Charter also led to differences in its application.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The Venice Charter and its subsequent interpretations have attracted criticism, especially by those who perceive it was built upon the Modernist biases of its creators. Professor of architecture Samir Younés has written: "The Charter’s abhorrence of restoration and reconstruction – with its implicit fear of "false history" – reflects the Modernist theory of [[historical determinism]], rather than the idea of a living architectural tradition. Major advances over the last 40 years in traditional design fluency and building crafts skills have undercut and outmoded many of the assumptions implicit in the Venice Charter. As a result, many now believe that visual harmony, aesthetic balance and the essential character of a place are of greater importance than abstract Modernist theories."&lt;ref name="Revisit"&gt;Hardy, Matthew (Ed.) ''The Venice Charter Revisited: Modernism, Conservation and Tradition in the 21st Century'', foreword by HRH The Prince of Wales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue is taken particularly with the words in Article 9: "Any extra work which is indispensable must be distinct from the architectural composition and ''must bear a contemporary stamp."''  This declaration has had a major impact on the management of historic buildings globally. In the U.S., for example, it shaped the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard #9 so it stated "...new work shall be differentiated from the old". It has been commonly interpreted to mean that interventions and additions have to be in Modernist styles, rather than being discreetly indicated by such devices as dated cornerstones and descriptive plaques. Many popular reconstructions now considered intrinsic to their locations, such as the 1912 rebuilding of the [[St Mark's Campanile|Campanile di San Marco]] in Venice, would violate the Venice Charter’s dictum: “All reconstruction work should however be ruled out "a priori".&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Because of concern over the damage being to historic settings by the Venice Charter's misapplication, in 2006 another conference was held in Venice under the auspices of INTBAU (the [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism]]). Its principal objective was to provide a theoretical framework that would enable new buildings and additions to be in greater harmony with their historic surroundings.&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Critics of the Venice Charter point to the 2005 Charleston Charter as providing preferred guidelines for dealing with historic areas. It states: “New construction in historic settings, including alterations and additions to existing buildings, should not arbitrarily impose contrasting materials, scales, or design vocabularies, but clarify and extend the character of the place, seeking always continuity and wholeness in the built environment.”&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

==Revisions==

Beginning with the [[World Heritage Convention]] (1972), some of the limited explanations in the Venice Charter were revised. The understanding of cultural heritage, which was expressed as historic monuments, was categorized as monuments, groups of buildings and sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.

In the Naples ICOMOS meeting on 7 November 1995; the question  [http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf ‘Should there be a review of the Venice Charter?’] was discussed with participation of Raymound Lemaire, the reporter of the Venice Charter in 1964. Thirty years after the Venice Charter, Lemaire declared that: "Charters are fashionable. They are considered to contribute to directing action. However they never contain more than the minimum on which the majority has agreed. Only exceptionally do they cover the whole of the issue which concerns them. This is the case with the Venice Charter."&lt;ref name="Lemaire"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.icomos.org/venicecharter2004/lemaire2.pdf|title= ICOMOS Scientific Journal: Raymond Lemaire: ICOMOS - un regard en arrière, un coup d'oeil en avant. (1995). Paris. |format=PDF |date=1995-11-07|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated his opinions about the present understanding of monuments and their restoration. He pointed out the necessity of a new document, or an effective adaptation, with consideration of the need "to be addressed with caution and wisdom, with respect for all cultures and above all with ethical and intellectual discipline."&lt;ref name="Lemaire" /&gt;

The Venice Charter has itself become an historic document. While some of its guidelines are considered to have proven their worth by both its supporters and critics, there are now plans for it to be rewritten.&lt;ref name="Erder" /&gt;

{{Expand Hungarian|Vendkérdés|date=September 2011}}

The '''Wendish question''' ({{lang-hu|Vendkérdés,}} {{lang-sl|Vendsko vprašanje,}} [[Prekmurje dialect]]: ''Vendsko pítanje,'' or ''Vendiško pitanje'') in Hungarian Nationalist and Chauvinist politics concerns the origin and nomenclature of the [[Hungarian Slovenes]].

The traditional Hungarian term for the [[Slovenes]] living in [[Hungary]] was "Wend" ({{lang-hu|Vend}}). Many Slovenes in Hungary accepted this nomenclature, although in their dialect, they always referred to themselves as "Slovenes". In the last decades of the 19th century, and especially during the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Horthy regime]], the term "Wend" was used in order to emphasize the difference between the Slovenes of historic Hungary and other Slovenes.

The term Wend received popular use among the emigre community in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  This same community vigorously opposed the including of Prekmurje into the new Yugoslavia, lobbying the US Trianon negotiators against such inclusion.

The border between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was finally regulated by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on June 4, 1920. The territory inhabited by Slovenes (the so-called ''Vendvidék'') was divided by the watershed of the two rivers [[Rába]] and [[Mur River|Mura]]. The Mura region ([[Prekmurje]]), including the areas of [[Murska Sobota]] and [[Lendava]], went to [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], while the Raba Region ([[Porabje]]) including nine communes around [[Szentgotthárd]], became part of Hungary. After this separation, the two regions' economy, politics, culture and ethnicity developed independently.

After the German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, Hungary annexed the regions lost in 1920 including Slovenian Prekmurje. It was expedient to argue that the inhabitants of the Prekmurje region were not Slovenes after all, helping to substantiate Hungary's claim to Prekmurje. [[Sándor Mikola]], a well-known Hungarian physicist hailing from Slovenian Prekmurje, used his influence to publicize this view in his book ''A Vendség múltja és jelene'' (''The past and present of the Wends''). In the book he describes how the Wends were descended from the [[Celts]], but assimilated into the surrounding Slavic population. This theory has no scientific foundation and is not linguistically substantiated in the language of this population.

Prekmurje remained a part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and [[SR Slovenia]] when the Trianon boundaries were restored after [[World War II]].
