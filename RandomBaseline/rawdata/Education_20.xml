'''The Alpheios Project''' is an open source initiative originally focused on developing software to facilitate reading [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]]. Dictionaries, grammars and inflection tables were combined in a set of web-based tools to provide comprehensive reading support for scholars, students and independent readers. The tools were implemented as browser add-ons so that they could be used on any web site or any page that a user might create in Unicoded HTML.
  
In collaboration with the Perseus Digital Library, the goals of the Alpheios Project were subsequently broadened to combine reading support with language learning. Annotation and editing tools were added to help users contribute to the development of new resources, such as enhanced texts that have been syntactically annotated or aligned with translations.
  
The Alpheios tools are designed modularly to encourage the addition of other languages that have the necessary digital resources, such as morphological analyzers and dictionaries. In addition to Latin and ancient Greek, Alpheios tools have been extended to [[Arabic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. 
 
The Alpheios Project is a non-profit ([[501c3]]) initiative. The software is open source, and resides on Sourceforge.com. The Alpheios software is released as [[GNU General Public License#|GPL 3.0]] and texts and data as [[Creative Commons license|CC-by-SA]].

== History ==

The Alpheios Project was established in 2007 by Mark Nelson, the founder of the commercial software company [[Ovid Technologies]], which he started after writing a search engine for medical literature that became widely popular in medical libraries and research facilities (Strauch, 1996). Nelson, who holds an MA in English literature from Columbia University, sold the company to [[Wolters Kluwer]] in 1999 (Quint, 1998). Nelson created Alpheios by recruiting several developers and programmers from his previous company, defining the project's initial goals and funding its first three years of operation. In 2008 he also provided the initial funding for The Perseus Treebank of Ancient Greek, which has subsequently been crowd-sourced.

In 2011, the Perseus Project hired key Alpheios staff and the activities of the projects were extensively integrated, although Alpheios remains an independent organization focused on developing adaptive reading and learning tools that can provide formative assessment customized to the individual user's special abilities and goals, including the study of specific authors or texts.

To date, all Alpheios applications, enhanced texts and code have been provided without any fees or licenses. A separate Alpheios LLC provides commercial consultation on customization and extension of the Alpheios tools.

'''Big Writing''' is an approach to [[teaching]] writing developed by Ros Wilson and marketed by Andrell Education. The aim of Big Writing is to advise schools on how to raise attainment level in speaking, listening and writing. The method is currently used by numerous [[schools]], primarily in the UK but also overseas. The target audience for Big writing are [[Key Stage 1]] and [[Key Stage 2]] students (i.e. those aged 5 to 11), although a slightly adjusted method is also taught that focuses on Foundation stage pupils and is known as 'Big Talk'. Andrell Education claims that Big Writing has proven to be successful in a number of schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastardsley.leeds.sch.uk/homedir/BigWriting.htm |title=Big Writing at East Ardsley Primary School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107102702/http://www.eastardsley.leeds.sch.uk/homedir/BigWriting.htm |archivedate=2010-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both with [[teachers]] and [[Students|pupils]], and points to [[case studies]] as evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancsngfl.ac.uk/projects/gp_award/getfile.php?src=163/Lomeshaye.J.007.018.pdf|title=Lomeshaye Junior School Case Study|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raising Standards in Writing"&gt;{{Cite book

==Description==

The first part of the Big Writing course to be developed was the Criterion Scale, an assessment tool linked to [[National Curriculum]] levels. From October 1999, Wilson spent three years working with the [[Local education authority|Kirklees LEA]] re-assessing work other teachers had already graded. During this time she read through and marked around 20,000 pieces of [[writing]] and observed that some teachers struggled to properly [[Educational assessment|assess]] work, and had too high of an opinion of their pupils' writing. She also noticed the students who were underachieving, particularly the ones that teachers had given too high a grade, all had similar weaknesses in their writing. Ros Wilson decided to develop a standard that teachers could use to assess pupils' writing more accurately, and in a way that Wilson claims is more scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenttrustweb.org.uk/kentict/kentict_sub_lit_levels.cfm |title=Writing Levels from 'Kent ICT' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191208/http://www.kenttrustweb.org.uk/kentict/kentict_sub_lit_levels.cfm |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbriagridforlearning.org.uk/index.php?category_id=835 |title=Writing Levels at Cumbria Grid for Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306060536/http://www.cumbriagridforlearning.org.uk/index.php?category_id=835 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this, Wilson believes teachers can more accurately assess a student's work, and provide better targeted teaching and more helpful feedback.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to address the weaknesses in children's writing that she noted as being common across schools, Wilson identified four features that she believes are key to improving writing in the primary age range: [[vocabulary]], [[Discourse marker|connectives]], openers and [[punctuation]], or V.C.O.P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/ealing/schools/westacton/web/communities/Y3/resources/Y3/VCOP/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110923170141/http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/ealing/schools/westacton/web/communities/Y3/resources/Y3/VCOP/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-23|title=V.C.O.P. at Early grid for Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=3014216|title=V.C.O.P.

&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Criterion Scale, V.C.O.P. became a core part of the Big Writing approach, which Wilson and Andrell Education have promoted through books and professional development courses.

Big Writing also emphasises talk for writing, and that pupils need to be taught to speak [[Standard English]] in order to help them make fewer spelling and grammar mistakes in their writing.

Andrell advises that classes have regular Big Write sessions (ideally  lasting one and a half hours, in order to allow children time to write at length), perhaps once a week, as well as regular short exercises throughout the school week in which children develop writing and editing skills with a focus on V.C.O.P.

Ros Wilson also advocates creating a positive environment for a writing through the use of candles, music and whatever else a teacher feels is beneficial in creating the right mood for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.chadvale.bham.sch.uk/big_writing.htm |title=Big Writing at Chadvale School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504041022/http://web.chadvale.bham.sch.uk/big_writing.htm |archivedate=2010-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Block letters'''  (known as '''printscript''', '''manuscript''', '''print writing''' or '''ball and stick''' in academics) are a [[sans-serif]] (or "gothic") style of writing [[Latin script]] in which the letters are individual [[glyph]]s, with no joining. In English-speaking countries, children are often first taught to write in block letters, and later may be taught [[cursive]] (joined) writing. In Germany, children start writing with block letters in the first grade and learn cursive writing from the second grade. Other countries (Dominican Republic, Poland, Italy, Austria, France, Romania, etc.) focus on cursive writing from the first grade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

On official forms, one is often asked to "please print". This is because cursive handwriting is harder to read, and the glyphs are joined so they do not fit neatly into separate boxes.

Block letters may also be used as a synonym of '''block capitals''', which means writing in [[all caps|all capital letters]] or in [[Small caps|large and small capital letters]], imitating the style of typeset capital letters. This is not a necessary implication, however: in at least one court case involving patents, trademarks and registration of designs, the term "block letters" was found to include both [[letter case|upper and lower case]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/ttab/2dissues/1998/98191.pdf Fossil Inc v The Fossil Group]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Citywide Educational Coalition''' (CWEC), is a tax-exempt, non-profit educational reform organization whose goal is to provide reliable and objective information on the Boston Public Schools to parents and citizens, enabling citizens to participate in policy making directly and through their school committee and increasing support for public education in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spalding|first1=Sheila|title=Desegregation-era Records Collection|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/Guide%20to%20the%20Desegregation-era%20Records%20collection_tcm3-23340.PDF|publisher=Boston City Archives|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Citywide Education Coalition was created in Boston, Massachusetts in order to create a community agenda for the [[Boston Public Schools]]. Incorporated in 1973 with the mission of circulating clear and accurate information regarding education reform, the Coalition was actively involved in a number of major decisions influencing the Boston School System, including the desegregation of Boston Public Schools.

==Background==

The CWEC was formed in 1972 by Mary Ellen Smith, who brought together parents and concerned citizens from across Boston who felt a need for involvement in the selection of a new superintendent of Boston Public Schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote&gt;{{cite web|last1=Citywide Educational Coalition|title=Citywide Educational Coalition: Historical Note|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m130findbioghist.htm|website=Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections|publisher=Northeastern University|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group, composed of parents, teachers, school administrators, church groups, community groups and concerned individuals came together around several major issues facing the Boston Public Schools: the search for superintendent, the need to improve quality of education in public schools, the desegregation crisis in Boston and the lack of reliable and accurate information about schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Since its founding, the CWEC has focused its energy on monitoring the implementation of the desegregation order, community organizing around educational issues, representing citizens in areas of educational decision making and on research and public information activities.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt;

==Desegregation of Boston Public Schools==
In the 1954 landmark case, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the legal basis for segregation within public schools is dismantled. The ruling declared that racial segregation violates the rights of United States citizens according to the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of laws for all American citizens.

Eighteen years later, in 1972, de facto segregation still existed in the Boston Public School System as a result of school districting practices by geographical location, which remained largely segregated within the city. A class action suit was filed on behalf of fifteen parents and forty-three children, with Tallulah Morgan as lead plaintiff, in the case that would come to be known as Morgan v. Hennigan. At that time sixty-eight schools in Boston were racially imbalanced and 30,000 Boston students used public transportation to get to school. In 1974, [[Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr.|Judge W. Arthur Garrity]] sided with the plaintiffs in Morgan vs. Hennigan and stated Boston School Committee had engaged in segregation. Garrity then ordered the school committee to implement the State Board of Education's Racial Imbalance plan until they produced a plan of their own for desegregation. September 12, 1974 marked the first day of school under this new program. The anti-desegregation group Restore our Alienated Rights (ROAR) called for a two-week boycott of schools, which caused a violent reaction, especially in South Boston, and left eighteen school buses damaged citywide.&lt;ref name="Boston City Archives"/&gt;

During this time, members of the Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) shifted focus to support the needs of the Boston school system, as well as its students and parents during this unstable period. By disseminating accurate information to parents through the Rumor Control Center and its newsletters, reports and parent guides, the Coalition actively participated in the desegregation of Boston schools.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; Throughout this volatile process, the Coalition developed safety procedures in the schools and along the bus routes, worked with students, parents, teachers and school administrators to improve the educational experience.&lt;ref name=HistNote /&gt; The CWEC developed a mailing list of over 3,000 people in neighborhoods across the city of racial and ethnic groups and also mobilized over 500 parent volunteers who worked to promote calm and diffuse violence in neighborhoods throughout the city, in the process gathering supporters with a continuing interest in bettering the school system as a whole.

By stepping into the space created by the failure of the Boston School Department and the city to distribute credible information on the desegregation of public schools, the CWEC continued to build its constituency. This expanding support, in combination with the unprecedented focus on public schools as a result of the desegregation orders created the perfect environment for the CWEC to use segregation related issues as a vehicle for pursuing broader educational reform.

==Projects==

The Citywide Educational Coalition (CWEC) has produced and widely circulated five major publications: Parents‚Äô Guide to Magnet Schools (1977), Magnet School in Boston: A Guide for Parents and Students (1978), Survey of Magnet Schools in Three Cities (1978), Boston Public Schools: A Guide for Parents and Students (1979) and The Basic Skills Improvement Program: What Parents Should Expect (1979).&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelber|first1=Scott|title="The crux and the magic": The Political History of Boston Magnet Schools, 1968‚Äì1989|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=453‚Äì466|doi=10.1080/10665680802397632|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10665680802397632#.VFvOqvnF92W|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CWEC has also recruited and trained a number of parent researchers to assist the Boston School Department in their production of the 1980 Guide to Elementary and Magnet Schools as well as publishing annual analyses of the Boston Public School Budget.&lt;ref name=Magnet/&gt;
These publications attempt to increase parent and citizen participation by providing clear, concise, objective information that is free of jargon and encourages parents and concerned citizens to act toward improving their child‚Äôs school and schools throughout the city.

Beginning in August 1974, the CWEC published a monthly newsletter first known as ‚ÄúCoalition‚Äù and later as ‚ÄúCommon Ground.‚Äù Nearly 20,000 copies were distributed each month with the help of volunteers to households throughout the city of Boston.

One of CWEC‚Äôs major projects was the creation of BPS Watch, a program that requires the Coalition decide upon a single issue facing the Boston Public Schools, such as reading competency, and research it in depth. The goal is to find ways in which this specific issue can be addressed by both the school and the community to improve its function within the school system.

CWEC acts also in an advisory capacity and technical assistant to the School Department. Members have become focused on basic skill competency and have examined vocational/occupational education planning with Boston schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K‚Äì12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots ‚Äì Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S.

'''Endurance training''' is the act of exercising to increase [[endurance]]. The term endurance training generally refers to [[Aerobic exercise|training the aerobic system]] as opposed to the [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] system.  The need for endurance in sports is often predicated as the need of cardiovascular and simple muscular endurance, but the issue of endurance is far more complex. Endurance can be divided into two categories including: general endurance and specific endurance. It can be shown that endurance in sport is closely tied to the execution of skill and technique. A well conditioned athlete can be defined as, the athlete who executes his or her technique consistently and effectively with the least effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis|title=Secrets of Russian Sports Fitness &amp; Training|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9817180-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endurance in sports ==

Endurance training is essential for a variety of endurance sports. A notable example is distance running events ([[800 meters]] upwards to [[marathon]] and [[ultra-marathon]]) with the required degree of endurance training increasing with race distance. Two other popular examples are cycling (particularly [[road cycling]]) and competitive swimming. These three endurance sports are combined in [[triathlon]]. Other sports for which extensive amounts of endurance training are required include rowing and cross country skiing. Athletes can also undergo endurance training when their sport may not necessarily be an endurance sport in the whole sense but may still demand some endurance. For instance aerobic endurance is necessary (to varying extents) in racket sports, football, rugby, martial arts, basketball and cricket. Endurance exercise tends to be popular with non-athletes for the purpose of increasing general fitness or burning more calories to increase weight loss potential.

== Physiological effects ==

Long-term endurance training induces many physiological adaptations both centrally and peripherally mediated. Central [[cardiovascular]] adaptations include decreased [[heart rate]], increased stroke volume of the heart,&lt;ref name=stoat&gt;"Physiology of Sport and Exercise" J.H. Wilmore, D.L. Costill, W.L. Kenney; 4th Ed, Human Kinetics 2008&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[blood plasma]], without any major changes in [[red blood cell]] count, which reduces [[blood viscosity]] and increased [[cardiac output]] as well as total [[mitochondrial volume]] in the [[muscle fiber]]s used in the training (i.e. the thigh muscles in runners will have more mitochondria than the thigh muscles of swimmers). Mitochondria increase in both number and size and there are similar increases in myoglobin and oxidative enzymes. Adaptations of the peripheral include [[capillarization]], that is an increase in the surface area that both the venous and arterial capillaries supply. This also allows for increased heat dissipation during strenuous exercise. The muscles heighten their [[glycogen]] and fat storing capabilities in endurance athletes in order to increase the length in time in which they can perform work. Endurance training primarily work the slow twitch (type 1) fibers and develop such fibers in their efficiency and resistance to fatigue. [[Catabolism]] also improves increasing the athletes capacity to use fat and glycogen stores as an energy source. These [[metabolic]] processes are known as [[glycogenolysis]], [[glycolysis]] and [[lipolysis]].  There is higher efficiency in oxygen transport and distribution. In recent years it has been recognized that oxidative enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase ([[Succinate dehydrogenase|SDH]]) that enable mitochondria to break down nutrients to form [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] increase by 2.5 times in well trained endurance athletes&lt;ref name=stoat /&gt;   In addition to SDH, [[myoglobin]] increases by 75-80% in well trained endurance athletes.&lt;ref name=stoat /&gt;

== Risks of excessive endurance training ==

The potential for negative health effects from long-term, high-volume endurance training have begun to emerge in the scientific literature in recent years.&lt;ref name="pmid18426850"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=M√∂hlenkamp S, Lehmann N, Breuckmann F, Br√∂cker-Preuss M, Nassenstein K, Halle M, Budde T, Mann K, Barkhausen J, Heusch G, J√∂ckel KH, Erbel R | title = Running: the risk of coronary events : Prevalence and prognostic relevance of coronary atherosclerosis in marathon runners | journal = Eur.

== Methods and training plans ==

Common methods for training include [[Sports periodization|periodization]], [[Interval training|intervals]], hard easy, [[long slow distance]], and in recent years [[high-intensity interval training]].  The periodization method is very common and was accredited to [[Tudor Bompa]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Triathlete's Training Bible'', Joe Friel, 2nd ed, p. 28, Velo Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  and consists of blocks of time, generally 4‚Äì12 weeks each.  The blocks are called preparation, base, build and race.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triathlete's Training Bible'', Joe Friel, 2nd ed, p. 29, Velo Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a structured training program with periodization is to bring the athlete into peak fitness at the time of a big race or event. Preparation as the name suggests lays the groundwork for heavier work to follow.  For a runner contemplating a competitive marathon the preparation phase might consist of easier runs of 1‚Äì4 miles 3-4 times per week and including 2‚Äì3 days of core strengthening.  In the base phase the athlete now works on building cardiovascular endurance by having several long runs staying in heart rate zone 1-2{{clarify|reason=The notion of 'heart rate zone' needs to be explained.|date=May 2017}} every week and each week adding slightly more mileage (using 10% rule for safely increasing the mileage).  Core strengthening is continued in the base period. Once the base phase is complete and the athlete has sufficient endurance, the build period is needed to give the athlete the ability to hold a faster pace for the race duration. The build phase is where duration of runs is traded for intensity or heart rate zones 3-5. An easy method to obtain intensity is [[interval training]] and interval training starts to happen in the build phase. Through interval training during the build phase the athlete can achieve higher [[Anaerobic exercise|lactate threshold]] and in some athletes [[VO2 max]] is increased.  Because interval training is demanding on the body, a professional coach should be consulted.  In the very least the athlete should do a warm up and active stretching before the interval session and static stretch or yoga after hard interval sessions. It is also advisable to have days of rest or easy workouts the day after interval sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Carmichael "High Intensity For High Performance" Triathlete Magazine pp. 34-36 Competitor Group December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the race phase of the periodization approach is where the duration of the workouts decreases but intense workouts remain so as to keep the high lactate threshold that was gained in the build phase. In [[Ironman Triathlon|Ironman]] training, the race phase is where a long "taper" occurs of up to 4 weeks for highly trained Ironman racers.  A final phase is designated transition and is a period of time, where the body is allowed to recover from the hard race effort and some maintenance endurance training is performed so the high fitness level attained in the previous periods will not be lost.

Traditionally, strength training (the performance of exercises with resistance or added weight) was not deemed appropriate for endurance athletes due to potential interference in the adaptive response to the endurance elements of an athlete's training plan. There were also misconceptions regarding the addition of excess body mass through muscle hypertrophy (growth) associated with strength training, which could negatively effect endurance performance by increasing the amount of work required to be completed by the athlete. However, more recent and comprehensive research has proved that short-term (8 weeks) strength training in addition to endurance training is beneficial for endurance performance, particularly long-distance running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beattie|first1=K|last2=Kenny|first2=IC|last3=Lyons|first3=M|last4=Carson|first4=BP|title=The Effect of Strength Training on Performance in Endurance|journal=Sports Medicine|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s40279-014-0157-y|pmid=24532151|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40279-014-0157-y|volume=44|pages=845‚Äì65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devices to assess endurance fitness==

The [[heart rate monitor]] is one of the relatively easy methods to assess fitness in endurance athletes.  By comparing heart rate over time fitness gains can be observed when the heart rate decreases for running or cycling at a given speed.  In cycling the effect of wind on the cyclists speed is difficult to subtract out and so many cyclists now use power meters built into their bicycles.  The [[Cycling power meter|power meter]] allows the athlete to actually measure power output over a set duration or course and allows direct comparison of fitness progression.&lt;ref&gt;''The Triathlete's Training Bible'', Joe Friel, 2nd ed, pp 64-65, Velo Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2008 Olympics [[Michael Phelps]] was aided by repeated [[Lactate threshold|lactate threshold measurement]]. This allowed his coaches to fine tune his training program so that he could recover between swim events that were sometimes several minutes apart.&lt;ref&gt;"2008 Olympic Coverage"&lt;/ref&gt;  Much similar to blood glucose for diabetes, lower priced lactate measurement devices are now available but in general the lactate measurement approach is still the domain of the professional coach and elite athlete.

'''Individual Education''' is a school system rooted in the [[individual psychology]] of [[Alfred Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Paul A.|title=Individual Education: Application of Adler's Personality Theory|journal=The Clearing House|date=September 1985|volume=59|issue=1|pages=35‚Äì38|jstor=30186457?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by [[Raymond Corsini]], the Individual Education program includes a number of basic principles. The program consists of three components: Academic; Creative/Applied; Socialization. Corsini also outlined disciplinary procedures and a number of other principles to ensure the most productive possible school environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nisan|first=Larry|title=Individual Education International|url=http://www.psychotherapyinstitute.com/pdf/IndividualEducationArticle.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Principles==

The following are the basic principles of the Individual Education School System:

* Children can veto their attendance in a class.
* Children are not in a competition or race; they only compete against themselves.
* Children decide if and when to study and there is no homework unless the child asks for it.
* Children can learn in whatever fashion works for them.
* Feedback regarding their learning is given to children as soon as possible.
* Every child has a teacher-adviser, an in-school parent figure who the child chooses.
* There are only three rules; they are impartially and strictly enforced.
* Children have the opportunity to develop special talents if they wish.
* Children are offered a wide range of creative/applied courses.
* Learning is considered a privilege, not an obligation.
* Teachers have the right to ask a child to leave a classroom or to stay out of their classroom.
* The school day is divided roughly equally between academic, creative/ applied and socialization.
* All evaluations are objective‚Äînot subjective.
* Idiosyncratic classroom rules may be established by the teacher for their class, so long as they don't violate Individual Education principles.
* The "GO" and "STOP" signals are the only means of enforcing rules in the classroom.
* Peer teaching is encouraged.
* Academic progress reports are kept on children, but grades are not given out.
* An individualized pace of learning is encouraged.
* Teachers are responsible for teaching; children are responsible for learning.
* The emphasis is on the development of a successful person.
* Community resources are accessed where possible.
* Children may be ''advised'' to study at the growing edge of their abilities, but the level at which they study is no one's choice but theirs.
* Faculty has three jobs: academic teaching, creative/applied teaching, and socialization training/advising.
* Regular full classroom meetings are mandatory.
* Rewards, honors and other extraneous motivators should be avoided.
* Criticisms, warnings, or various other forms of punishment are strictly forbidden.
* The school operates on the basis of natural and logical consequences, using encouragement and intrinsic joy from skill mastery as the primary motivators for learning.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisan|first=Larry|title=Individual Education International|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|date=Summer 2003|volume=59|issue=2|pages=207‚Äì212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children have the right to go to any other classroom or supervised library or study hall.
* On any given day, children can choose not to learn.
* Teachers have full freedom in teaching the curriculum, but cannot force children to follow it.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Speaking Out: A Clarification Letter to the Editors: A Critique of Clark's "Individual Education"|journal=The Clearing House|year=1987|volume=60|issue=5|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321|doi=10.1080/00098655.1987.9959321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Four Rs: Responsibility, Respect, Resourcefulness, Responsiveness===

====Responsibility====
A primary goal of Individual Education is to make children self-sufficient, giving them the mean to become a productive member of society; to become mature and self-reliant. Individual Education is against the infantilization of the child. Instead, Individual Education maximizes the child's self-determination.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Individual Education|url=http://www.psychotherapyinstitute.com/documents/IndividualEducationFull.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Respect====
Individual Education is designed to develop in children feeling of respect of the self and of others. Traditional school systems make children feel inferior and make many of them feel unsuccessful. A system based on rewards and punishment, praise and disapproval, is considered morally bankrupt in the Individual Education system. Some children are not born into environments conducive to academics. Some children have strengths not visible in the traditional system. Any system that insults these children is wrong.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Resourcefulness====
Every child has innate talents, and some strengths and weaknesses. Whatever resources the child has, Individual Education permits expression, whether academic or non-academic. If little Michaelangelo wants to paint, let him. If he therefore never learns how to solve square roots, so be it. If little Willy Gates doesn't want to leave his computer alone, let him. If he therefore never reads Shakespeare, so be it. As long as Michaelangelo can do basic math, and Willy can read well, that is enough. For others, a broader program will be necessary. The child will determine the program that best suits him/her. The curriculum will be there when he/she needs it. The teacher will encourage learning of all types of academe, but will not force it.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

====Responsiveness====
The concept of Social Interest (''Gemeinschaftsgefuhl'' in Adlerian theory) is central to Individual Education. It means responding to the needs of others. It can be seen in school spirit, patriotism, love for family, or elsewhere. This is critical to a child becoming a productive and happy member of society.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt; This goal is not achieved directly, but rather through the achievement of the first 3 Rs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Timothy|title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_199009_evans.pdf|publisher=Educational Leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Program ==
The curriculum in the academic component is similar to that in the traditional system.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, Timothy D. |author2=Corsini, Raymond J. |author3=Gazda, George M. |title=Individual Education and the 4Rs|journal=Educational Leadership|date=September 1990|volume=48|issue=1|pages=52|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9107151407/individual-education-4rs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Language, mathematics, history/geography and science are developed along the mastery model‚Äîthrough a skills list through which children progress from the beginning of school to the end. Children are tested weekly on average but it is the children who request to be tested; teachers cannot demand that tests be written. Instead a Progress Chart shows how far along the child is (80% is considered mastery). The child doesn't have to learn what he/she has already learned‚Äîif the child can pass a test without attending class, the Progress Chart is marked identically to that of a child that attended hours of classroom study. A quick learner is offered the next level of curriculum and the opportunity to tutor others. No numerical or letter-based grading system is used.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Creative/Applied Courses==
These courses can be offered in 6-8 week blocks. 1-3 can be chosen out of 9-12 courses offered. Included are topics students want to learn but do not find in traditional curriculum.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; They usually involve some physical activities (e.g. soccer), some artistic ones (visual arts) and some applied (horticulture). Teachers offer courses in areas of their interest. Community resources are used where possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Socialization aspect==
Teachers socialize children through their positions as teachers and advisers. Children can choose their adviser, though the teacher can choose whether to accept that student.&lt;ref name="Corsini 1987"/&gt;  The adviser is an equal to the child in this environment (unlike during the academic program), and can only enforce the first school rule, related to dangerous behavior (see below). They meet as a group (the adviser with all children who have chosen him or her, or in the absence of a decision by the child, the child is assigned an adviser).Among other things, students learn about problem solving, health maintenance, interpersonal communications and purpose in life.&lt;ref name="Evans, Timothy D.; Corsini, Raymond J.; Gazda, George M. 1990 52"/&gt; The adviser supervises homeroom, which occurs at the beginning and end of the day and is unstructured. At least once a week and sometimes every day, the adviser holds a class meeting during which time the children discuss their various concerns. Rules regarding homeroom and class meetings can only be decided democratically. The teacher can suggest rules but the children decide by a vote.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The adviser is also the liaison between the child and other teachers with whom there may be difficulties, and can act as a mediator. The adviser also liaises with the child's parents but only on rare occasions and only with the child's consent. The child should always be in the room during such discussions if possible.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

The socialization program includes "playtime" for younger children. Other teachers are also free to discuss social matters with children, as equals.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

==Disciplinary Procedure==
Individual Education schools have only three school rules:&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;
# Never do anything that could be dangerous, damaging or harmful to yourself or others, or property.
# Be in a supervised place or en route to a supervised place.
# If a teacher gives you the GO signal, leave the room immediately and silently and without distracting the others.

There are no exceptions to these rules. Violation of one of these rules means the child is given a violation slip which they take to the office to have recorded.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

Teachers can establish idiosyncratic classrooms, but they cannot violate the three rules above. Because there are so few rules, teachers must ensure that they are strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="Nisan2003" /&gt;

These rules are largely based on the discipline concepts of Rudolf Dreikurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs, R., Grunwald, B., and Pepper, F.|title=Maintaining sanity in the classroom|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dreikurs' concept of logical consequences is particularly useful in understanding the Individual Education disciplinary procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreikurs|first=Rudolf|title=Psychology in the Classroom|year=1957|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GO and STOP===

The GO signal is a gesture towards the door. A teacher may quietly say the child's name and make the gesture. The child must then leave the classroom immediately and silently without disruption to others. The child then has a few options: go to another class; go to the study hall; go to the library; seek to re-enter the classroom. The child can return to the classroom but may be given the STOP signal at that time, which means the child must go to another option. The STOP signal is a hand held face up in the direction of the child entering.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

Teachers should not keep track of the number of times they give out the GO and STOP signals. They have no meaning in terms of the child's progress in school, and should carry no social consequences. A teacher must not warn the child of an impending GO signal, nor intimidate the child by standing close to them or giving them negative looks. There is no use in intimidating the child, who will rebel against such an attempt.&lt;ref name=Nisan2003 /&gt;

===Consequences of Violations===

For each violation there is a consequence. If the ultimate consequence of expulsion is applied, it should include a referral to other professional help.&lt;ref name="psychotherapyinstitute" /&gt;

===Findings===
Research articles have indicated the following findings:
# Students' scores on standardized achievement tests typically exceed national averages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=232‚Äì246}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Yearly academic gains are similar. Several schools that were initially low in district academic rank made impressive gains in rank. This is in spite of only half the amount of academic instructional time being spent in Individual Education schools compared to the traditional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|author2=Michael Mastroianni|title=How Corsini 4R Schools Work|journal=Individual Education International|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are far less disciplinary problems in Individual Education schools.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41‚Äì57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Ann|title=Summary of Research on Individual Education Through 1984|journal=Individual Psychology|year=1985|volume=41|pages=41‚Äì57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In many cases, 100% of teachers surveyed in a school have said that they prefer teaching in an Individual Education school rather than in a traditional one. The main comment is that teachers can put their energies into teaching.&lt;ref name="Pratt 1985 41‚Äì57"/&gt;
# Parents endorse the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=L.|title=Summary of Research on an Individual Education School|journal=Journal of Individual Psychology|year=1981|volume=37|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Present Status of Individual Education==

Raymond Corsini recognized in the late 1960s that adults were mistakenly blaming children for their poor behavior and grades in school when the problems were promoted by the school system in which the children operated. Corsini argued that the traditional system of education was fundamentally undemocratic. Children were "sentenced" to attend an institution where they had no choice of teacher or level of study, and minimal choice in terms of subjects, places or means of study. He set out to design a school system in which respect would be a central principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Ray|title=Alternative Education Systems|year=1979|publisher=F.E. Peacock|location=Itasca, IL|author2=Ignar, E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Paul Clark confirmed that Individual Education is an effective method of encouraging learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Paul A.|title=A Case Study of Two Corsini 4R Schools|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED302907&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED302907|publisher=Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association (Louisville, KY, November 8‚Äì11, 1988).|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, there were a dozen individual education schools operating in North America and Europe, including Hawaii, Illinois, Colorado, British Columbia and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Keith A|title=Individual Education/Corsini's 4R Schools: Another Look|journal=Individual Psychology|date=September 1987|volume=43|issue=3|pages=370‚Äì377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One school, the Blooming Grove Academy, operated in Bloomington, Illinois from 1986 until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blooming Grove Academy Student/Parent Handbook|url=http://www.bloominggroveacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ParentHandbook.pdf|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forest Park I.E. (K-5) and Hufford I.E.(6-8), both in Joliet, IL continue to operate using the Corsini system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joliet Public Schools/ |url=http://www.joliet86.org/our-schools/forest-park/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original Individual Education School, Ho'Ala School in Wahiawa, Hawaii, continues to be in operation for kindergarten to grade 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ho'Ala School|url=http://www.hoala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; DaVinci Charter School closed down in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Da Vinci Charter School|url=http://www.davincicharterschools.org/cms/|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32333">'''Friends schools''' are institutions that provide an education based on the [[Religious Society of Friends#Beliefs and testimonies|beliefs and testimonies]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). This article is a list of schools currently or historically associated with the Society of Friends, regardless of their current degree of affiliation.

Friends schools vary greatly, both in their interpretation of Quaker principles and in how they relate to formal organizations that make up the Society of Friends.  Most Friends schools are similar in their mission however: to provide an academically sound education while also instilling values of community, spirituality, responsibility and stewardship in their students.&lt;ref name="Quaker Education: What‚Äôs Different about a Friends School?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/articles/10|title=Quaker Education:  What‚Äôs Different about a Friends School? - BoardingSchoolReview.com|website=BoardingSchoolReview.com|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions founded by Friends were never formally "Quaker schools." Some historically Friends institutions are no longer formally associated with the Society of Friends. Those that continue to call themselves "Quaker schools" may have formal oversight from a Friends [[yearly meeting|yearly]] or [[monthly meeting]]s (often called coming "under care of" a meeting), and others are governed by members of the Society of Friends and/or adhere to aspects of Quaker practice.

Because of the wide range of Friends, the branch (or branches) of Quakerism with which the school affiliates are included, and where applicable the [[Yearly Meeting|Yearly]], Quarterly or [[Monthly meeting|Monthly]] Meeting under whose care or governance the school is held is shown.

'''Microlearning''' deals with relatively small learning units and short-term learning activities. The term is used in [[e-learning]] and related fields in the sense of [[learning]] processes in mediated environments. Microlearning is a holistic approach for skill based learning and education which deals with relatively small learning units. It involves short-term-focused strategies especially designed for skill based understanding/learning/education. Microlearning refers to micro-perspectives of learning, education, training and skill development. The approaches followed for assessment of microlearning are multidimensional &amp; holistic in nature and need based in particular cases [Patil U.K., 1999] [Patil U.K., 2000]. An ideal instructional approach for many situations especially in higher education for skill development, trainability and employability of learners/students [Patil U.K., 2002]. The technique is capable enough to address challenges associated with slow learners [Patil U.K., 2005]. This learning technique is versatile not only for skill based education but also for sustainable socioeconomic development. Without taking care of micro-perspectives in the context of learning, education, training and skill development, a skill based education cannot be imparted effectively [Patil U.K., 2009].

In a wide sense, microlearning can be understood as a metaphor which refers to micro aspects of a variety of learning models, concepts and processes.
{{quote|"No matter if learning refers to the process of building up and organizing [[knowledge]], to the change of [[behaviour]], of [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], of [[values]], of mental abilities, of [[cognitive]] structures, of emotional reactions, of action patterns or of societal dimensions, in all cases we have the possibility to consider micro, [[wikt:meso-|meso]] and [[macroscopic|macro]] aspects of the various views on more or less persisting changes and sustainable alterations of performances." (Hug 2005, p. 4).}}
Depending on frames and domains of reference, micro, meso and macro aspects vary. They are relational concepts. For example, in the context of language learning, one might think of micro aspects in terms of vocabularies, phrases, sentences, and distinguish them from situations and episodes (meso aspects) and socio-cultural specifics or complex semantics (macro aspects). In a more general discourse on learning, one might differentiate between the learning of individuals, group learning or learning of organizations and the learning of generations or societies.

Furthermore, microlearning marks a transition from common models of learning towards micro perspectives on and the significance of micro dimensions in the process of learning. The microlearning approach is an emergent [[paradigm]], so there are no hard definitions or coherent uses of the term yet. However, the growing focus on microlearning activities can be seen by [[World Wide Web|web]] users' activities on the subject, who [[tag (metadata)|tag]] their corresponding [[weblog]] postings and [[social bookmarking|social bookmarks]] with the term "microlearning".

As an [[instructional technology]], microlearning focuses on the design of microlearning activities through micro steps in digital media environments, which already is a daily reality for today's [[knowledge workers]]. These activities can be incorporated into learner's daily routines and tasks. Unlike "traditional" e-learning approaches, microlearning often tends towards [[push technology]] through [[push media]], which reduces the [[cognitive load]] on the learners. Therefore, the selection of micro [[learning object]]s and also pace and timing of microlearning activities are of importance for didactical designs.

Microlearning, in a nutshell, is a digital learning experience designed to be effective, engaging and enjoyable. Microlearning provides bite-sized learning content in stark contrast to the traditional model of learning and thus engagement follows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.masteroapp.com/ Master-O - Gamified Microlearning Platform.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
Microlearning can be characterized as follows:
* Microlearning processes often derive from interaction with [[microcontent|micro-content]], which takes place either in designed (media) settings (e-learning) or in emergent micro-content structures like weblog postings or social bookmark managers on the [[World Wide Web]] (Mosel 2005).
* Microlearning can be an assumption about the time needed to solve a learning task, for example answering a question, memorizing an information item, or finding a needed resource (Masie 2006). Learning processes that have been called "microlearning" can cover a span from few seconds (e.g. in mobile learning) up to 15 minutes or more. There is some relation to the term [[microteaching|micro-teaching]], which is an established practice in teacher education. 
* Microlearning can also be understood as a ''process'' of subsequent, "short" learning activities, i.e. learning through interaction with micro-content objects in small timeframes. In this case, the design, selection, feedback and pacing of repeated or otherwise "chained" microlearning tasks comes into view.
* In a wider sense, microlearning is the way more and more people are actually doing informal learning and gaining knowledge in micro-content, [[micromedia|micro-media]] or [[human multitasking|multitasking]] environments ([[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]), especially those that become increasingly based on [[Web 2.0]] and [[wireless]] technologies. In this wider sense, the borders between microlearning and the complementary concept of [[microknowledge|micro-knowledge]] are blurring.

==Dimensions==
The following dimensions can be used to describe or design microlearning activities:
* '''Time:''' relatively short effort, operating expense, degree of time consumption, measurable time, [[subjective time]], etc.
* '''Content:''' small or very small units, narrow topics, rather simple issues, etc.
* '''Curriculum:''' small part of curricular setting, parts of modules, elements of informal learning, etc.
* '''Form:''' fragments, facets, episodes, "knowledge nuggets", skill elements, etc.
* '''Process:''' separate, concomitant or actual, situated or integrated activities, iterative method, [[attention management]], awareness (getting into or being in a process), etc.
* '''Mediality:''' print media, electronic media, mono-media vs. multi-media, (inter-)mediated forms, etc.
* '''Learning type:''' repetitive, activist, reflective, pragmatist, [[Concept|conceptualist]], constructivist, [[Connectivism|connectivist]], behaviorist; also: [[action learning]], classroom learning, corporate learning, etc.
(Hug 2005, used with permission)

==Subscription learning==
"Subscription learning, as its name implies, provides an intermittent stream of learning-related interactions to those who are subscribed. These learning-related interactions‚Äîcalled "nuggets"‚Äîcan involve a great variety of learning-related events, including content presentation, diagnostics, scenario-based questions, job aids, reflection questions, assignments, discussions, etc. [[Learning nugget|Nuggets]] are short, usually presented in less than five to ten minutes. Nuggets are intentionally scheduled over time to support learning, often utilizing research-based findings related to the spacing effect. Learners subscribe (or are subscribed) to one or more series of learning nuggets, called "threads". Learning threads can be predesigned, selecting nuggets based on anticipated learner needs or they can be dynamically created based on learner performance." (Thalheimer, 2013).

Subscription learning characteristics:
* Learners subscribe or are subscribed to a series ("threads") of short informational interactions ("nuggets").
* Interactions usually last less than five or ten minutes.
* Learners usually receive these nuggets through some form of push technology.
* Subscription-learning threads are usually‚Äîand preferably‚Äîdesigned using the scientific find known as the spacing effect. (Thalheimer, 2013).

==Examples of activities==
* reading a paragraph of [[writing|text]], [[e-mail]] or [[short message service|sms]]
* listening to an informational (short) [[podcast]] 
*watching a short video clip
* viewing a [[flashcard]]
* memorizing a word, vocabulary, definition or formula
* sorting a set of (micro-content) items by chronological order
* selecting an answer to a question
* answering questions in quizzes
* playful learning with micro-games
* composing a [[haiku]] or a short poem
*writing or drawing a reflection on just-viewed content
*rating confidence in an answer to a question 

==Applications (examples)==
* Screensavers which prompt the user to solve small series of simple tasks after a certain amount of inactivity
* Quizzes with [[multiple choice]] options on [[cell phones]] by use of [[short message service|sms]] or mobile applications ([[java platform|java]] [[midlet]]s, [[symbian]])
* Word of the day as daily [[RSS (file format)|RSS]]-feed or [[e-mail]]
* Flashcard-software for memorizing content through [[spaced repetition]]
* Short videos (2-10) minutes either presented stand alone or in a series

{{wiktionary|on-the-job}}
'''On-the-job training''' (sometimes called [[direct instruction]]) is one-on-one training located at the job site. It usually consists of an experienced workers passing down their skills to a new employee. This type of training is usually used for practical tasks.

In antiquity, the work performed by most people did not rely on [[abstract thinking]], or academic education. Parents or community members, who knew the skills necessary for survival, passed their knowledge on to the children through direct instruction. This method is still widely used today. It is a frequently used because it requires only a person who knows how to do the task and the tools the person uses to do the task. It may not be the most effective or the most efficient method at times, but it is normally the easiest to arrange and manage. Because the training takes place on the job, it can be highly realistic and no transfer of learning is required. It is often inexpensive because no special equipment is needed other than what is normally used on the job. One drawback is that {{abbr|OJT|On the job training}} takes the trainer and materials out of production for the duration of the training time. In addition, due to safety or other production factors, it is prohibitive in some environment.
Even many researchers show the importance of the On the Job Training.A large majority of employee learning is accomplished through on-the-job training. Well designed OJT training programs are well planned and resourced, staff managers with competent coaching ability, and define the criterion for performance standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snell|first1=Scott|title=Managing Human Resources|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=305‚Äì306|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On the job training is one of the earliest forms of training in the United States. It is the method in which someone is taught by watching an already trained professional. This is typically done on a one-to-one basis. This was originally used as the method of training, when people were not capable of being able to read and write. This is why this method dates back to many, many years ago. This method was used because it didn‚Äôt require many materials, just one person who knows how to do the job, and the necessary tools. This method of training does not require any training guides, etc. Over the years, as society has grown, on the job training has become less popular. Now that people are able to read and write, many companies have switched to doing training in simulation fields, and having employees read training guides. Many jobs that would use on the job training, now prefer to hire employees who are already experienced and have the required skill set. However, there are still many companies who feel that on the job training is the best for their employees. This means that the new employee will be taught the necessary skills to complete the job while they are on the job site.

==Psychology==

The concept of observational learning was introduced by Albert Bandura. Bandura‚Äôs theory about people learning best from the people surrounding them, is called the Social Cognitive Theory. Bandura believes that people learn best by observing people around them. Some of the things that he brings up during this theory, is that people first must pay attention to those around them. Next, the learner must retain what they have observed, and try to reproduce what they have watched. This links nicely to the idea of on the job training, in the aspect that the new employees first observe their trainer. They may watch this person first complete the task, before trying it themselves. After observing for some time, people typically will imitate the action they had observed. This is exactly how on the job training is expected to occur. First, the trainer will model their task for the new employee to watch. After this is done a few times, the new employee will try their best to produce the same outcome. This type of training will occur as long as necessary, until the new employee is capable of performing the task on their own.
==Pros and Cons==

As far as on the job training goes, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this type of training goes. Most companies have to weigh out these options before they decide which type of training they will use with their new employees. In some case, the disadvantages are too strong, and companies have to shy away from OJT. A list of pros and cons can be found below.

===Pros===

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; On the job training is a quick method of training. There is no time being wasted in the classroom, only for the person to get to the job and still not know what to do. This is also a way of someone getting their feet wet from the get go, and not having to learn over a long period of time.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; When a company is short on employees, and needs to hire someone new, they are able to have the employee immediately on the job! This means there is not any extra time wasted with fewer people on the job.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; It is oftentimes hard to create a simulation of the work environment in a training field. By doing the on the job training, everyone is taught exactly what they will be using on a daily basis.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Cost effective method of on the job training, means that no money is being wasted on separate training.

===Cons===

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; On the job training can sometimes cause an issue when employees are not properly trained teachers. Not every employee is capable of training someone, which would then mean that trainers would need to placed on the job site.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; On the job training can also cause distractions to the job. This would also affect the productivity of the job, and lead to it being down in a slower amount of time. If the employees are constantly having to help someone new, they are spending less time on the task.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; In many jobs, there are safety precautions that need to be taught prior to entering the job field. Without employees being properly trained, there could be injuries that occur on the jobsite.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; On the job training, is oftentimes rushed, which results in low productivity of the employee.

The '''raising of school leaving age''' (shortened to '''ROSLA''') is the name given by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave [[compulsory education]] in [[England and Wales]] as specified under an [[Education Act]]. As in most countries, the [[school leaving age]] often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are old enough to be regarded as an adult.

In England and Wales this age has been raised numerous times since the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. On 1 September 1972, the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began eight years earlier in 1964. This left a gap year of school leavers who, by law, had to complete an additional year of education from 1973 onwards. Many of the age raisings in the 19th and 20th centuries were aimed at generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, government statistics showed that 11% of 16 to 18 year-olds were neither continuing their education after completion of their [[GCSE]]s, nor in full-time employment or an apprenticeship, thus increasing the overall [[unemployment]] rate given many are unable to find work.&lt;ref name=2013confirm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6254833.stm "School leaving age set to be 18"]. BBC News. 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of seventeen years by 2013 and eighteen years by 2015,&lt;ref name=bbc-n.d.&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/education_after_16/ What happens after the age of 16?] BBC.co.uk, 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it could change this.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223141431/http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/education/schools/school-leaving-age/education-leaving-age-$474737.htm Education leaving age brief] Politics.co.uk, 12 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
[[Image:William Edward Forster - Project Gutenberg eText 13789.jpg|135px|thumb|'''William Edward Forster''' drafted the first Education Act in 1870]]
Prior to the 19th century, there were very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the [[Church of England|church]], for the church, stressing [[religious education]]. In the latter part of the 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to be a matter for local option, with the introduction of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] a milestone in the British school education system.&lt;ref name=genuki&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk:8080/big/eng/LIN/schools.html Lincolnshire School Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830043848/http://www.genuki.org.uk:8080/big/eng/LIN/schools.html |date=30 August 2008 }} Genuki.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in [[Agriculture|agricultural]] areas.&lt;ref name=2013proposal1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6135516.stm School leaving age may be raised] news.bbc.co.uk, 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] (applying to '''England and Wales'''), commonly known as ''Forster's Education Act'' having been drawn up by [[William Edward Forster]], created the concept of '''compulsory education''' for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education compulsory was at the discretion of school boards; education was compulsory in approximately 40% of schools by 1873.&lt;ref name="edu_act_1870_compulsory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/education-acts-of-tough-on-poor-families/|title=Education Acts 1870 1873 1876|work=Intriguing History |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where education was considered a problem, elected [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] could be set up. These boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], to require attendance and fine the parents of children who did not attend.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt; There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which varied by board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.

The [[Elementary Education Act 1880]] insisted on '''compulsory attendance''' from 5‚Äì10 years.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt; For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, as it was more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. '''Attendance Officers''' often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children under the age of 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the ''educational standard''; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised.&lt;ref name="crucial_events_historical"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxford-royale.co.uk/articles/crucial-events-history-english-schools.html |title=15 Crucial Events in the History of English Schools |work=Oxford Royale |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the '''Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893''', which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/education.htm Key dates in British Education (1000-1899)] ThePotteries.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
In 1900 education was made compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14, with some exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Connell |first1=William |title=The Educational Thought and Influence of Matthew Arnold |date=1950 |publisher=Routledge |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; School boards were abolished in 1902 and replaced with [[local education authority|local education authorities]], which are still in use to the present day.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt;

===The ''Fisher Act'' of 1918===
The year 1918 saw the introduction of the [[Education Act 1918]], commonly also known as the '''Fisher Act''' as it was devised by [[H. A. L. Fisher|Herbert Fisher]]. The act enforced compulsory education from 5‚Äì14 years, but also included provision for compulsory part-time education for all 14-to-18-year-olds. There were also plans for expansion in [[tertiary education]], by raising the participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after [[World War I]] made this impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18.&lt;ref name="education_until_18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/29/schools.uk3 |title=
Q&amp;A: The new school leaving age |work=The Guardian |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1918 act was not implemented until a further act of 1921 was passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter03.html Education in England - 3] www.educationengland.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's post-war education changes===
[[File:Machanhill Primary School HORSA Huts - geograph.org.uk - 1281710.jpg|right|thumb|HORSA Huts, constructed circa 1947 to handle the increased student numbers as a result of the leaving age increase]]
In 1944, [[Rab Butler]] introduced the [[Education Act 1944]] which amongst other changes, including the introduction of the [[Tripartite System]], included raising the school leaving age to 15. Although the act should have been brought into effect as from September 1939, it was not implemented because of the effects of [[World War II]], but was eventually enforced from April 1947.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt;&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; The [[comprehensive school]] system has since replaced the [[Tripartite System of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|Tripartite System]] brought in by this act across most of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sociologytwynham.com/2008/12/21/tripartite-to-comprehensive-schools/ |title=From tripartite to comprehensive schools and the New Right |work=Sociology Twynham |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act also recommended compulsory part-time education for all children until the age of 18, but was dropped, in  similar fashion to the 1918 Act, to cut spending after World War II.&lt;ref name=education_until_18/&gt;

====Reasons====
Changes in government approaches towards education meant that it was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when [[adolescence]] was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education.&lt;ref name="bbc_1994act_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/25751787 |title=Rab Butler's 1944 act brings free secondary education for all |work=BBC News |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.&lt;ref name=schoolreview1947&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1082674|title=Raising the School-Leaving Age in Britain|first=H. C.|last=Dent|date=1 January 1947|publisher=|journal=The School Review|volume=55|issue=9|pages=523‚Äì525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects====
This act introduced the [[Eleven plus exam|11+ examination]] to determine if a child should be eligible for a [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]], [[secondary modern]] or technical college, under the [[Tripartite System]],&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England&lt;ref name="11+_explained"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.relocatemagazine.com/articles/grammar-school-and-the-11plus-explained |title=Grammar school and the 11+ explained |work=Relocate Global |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref name="scotland_11+_phasedout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13073520.11__exam__put_people_off_study_/ |title=11+ exam 'put people off study' |work=The Herald Scotland |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools;&lt;ref name=telegraph-020307&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544211/Grammars-still-dominate-league-tables.html |title=Grammars still dominate league tables |work=The Telegraph |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.&lt;ref name="telegraph_grammar_jan17"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/01/19/secondary-school-league-tables-2017-1500-schools-failing-figures/ |title=Grammar school children excel while comprehensives fall behind, figures show |work=The Telegraph |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in society and approaches towards education, including [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]], has meant that it is now recognised that all children deserve to have the same educational opportunities without singling out those who learn at a slower rate than others, thus every child has the opportunity to gain secondary school level qualifications or similar, regardless of background or intelligence.

===Leaving age raised to 16===
In 1964, preparations began to raise the school leaving age to 16.&lt;ref name="politics_eduleaveage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/education-leaving-age |title=Education leaving age |work=politics.co.uk |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt; As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw the introduction of the '''Education (Work Experience) Act''', allowing LEAs to organise [[work experience]] for the additional final year school students.&lt;ref name="education_timeline"&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/timeline.html Education in England - Timeline] educationengland.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of [[Middle Schools in England|middle school]]s in 1968,&lt;ref name="education_timeline"/&gt; where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="msuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/middleschools/ |title=Middle Schools in the UK |work=UK Middle Schools |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607 /&gt;

====ROSLA Buildings====
For many secondary schools around England and Wales in areas without a Middle School, accommodating for the new 5th year students would be a struggle. A popular solution was to provide those schools with a [[pre-fabricated]] building (often referred to as ''ROSLA Buildings'' or ''ROSLA Blocks'') that were in need of additional capacity,&lt;ref name="politicsbrief-120607"/&gt; providing them with the resources to cope with the new [[generation]] of 5th year students. This solution proved popular with many schools across the country, not least due to the low cost involved for materials and construction, but also the speed which these buildings could be erected.  Many were supplied by [[F. Pratten and Co Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-320000-135000/page/3|title=Spaxton V.C.Primary School.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getschool.php?id=1030|title=Wiltshire Community History|work=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationandtraining.org.uk/schools/school/pratten-hut-st-dunstan-school/|title=Pratten Hut ‚Äì St Dunstan School, Calne, Wiltshire - UK Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmyschool.co.uk/schooldetails.aspx?id=79918|title=School website for The Rainbow Pre-School Learning Centre Warminster with Ofsted inspection report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROSLA Buildings were delivered to schools in [[self assembly]] packs, being assembled by a team often within days, regardless of weather conditions.  Consequently, they were not intended to stand long-term, though some have proven to have stood much longer than was initially planned.&lt;ref name="politicsbrief-120607"/&gt; Many ROSLA Buildings shared similar exterior attributes such as their design, with the only difference being the separation of rooms within the building. The room separation within the building was decided upon by senior school management, hence many walls are false from being added in after construction.

Although the majority of schools around England and Wales have since replaced the ROSLA Building at their site, there are still numerous schools around the country which are still actively using these buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Education Act 1996===
Between 1976 and 1997, the minimum school leaving arrangements were:
* A child whose sixteenth birthday falls in the period 1 September to 31 January inclusive, may leave compulsory schooling at the end of the Spring term (the following [[Easter]]).
* A child whose sixteenth birthday falls in the period 1 February to 31 August, may leave on the Friday before the last Monday in May.

Under the Education Act 1996, a new single school leaving date was set for 1998 and all subsequent years thereafter. This was set as the last Friday in June in the school year which the child reaches the age of 16.&lt;ref name="school_attendance_nov16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/564599/school_attendance.pdf |title=Guidance for maintained schools, academies, independent schools and local authorities |publisher=Gov.uk |date=November 2016 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
===Education and Skills Act 2008===
[[Image:Employment graph 16-18.png|thumb|right|260px| Graph showing the percentage of young people in employment or training, at ages 16 and 18 respectively.&lt;ref name=economistref1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/8559710 | work=The Economist | title=Staying on - The best days of their lives will soon drag on a bit longer | date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reports published in November 2006 suggested that [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] was exploring ways to raise the school leaving age in '''England''' to 18, just over 40 years later than the last rise in 1972, pointing to the decline in unskilled jobs and the need for young people to be equipped for modern day employment.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt;

====Participation Age====
A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] unveiled the government's plans in his [[Queen's Speech]]. The plans included the duty for parents to assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The [[Education and Skills Act 2008]], when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation in some form of education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015.&lt;ref name="rpa_timeline"&gt;[http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/r/rpa%20timeline.pdf Raising the Participation Age - Timeline] HMSO, 24 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This was referred to as raising the "participation age"&lt;ref name="rpa_myth_buster"&gt;[http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/r/130729%20mythbuster.pdf Participation Age Myth Buster] HMSO, 29 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16.&lt;ref name="know-when-you-can-leave-school"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school School leaving age] HMSO, 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available.&lt;ref name="rpa_myth_buster" /&gt; The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion,&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7080699.stm School leaving age plans unveiled] BBC News, 6 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.&lt;ref name="know-when-you-can-leave-school" /&gt;

====Reasons====
Figures were published in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16‚Äì18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% of young people who may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in [[sixth form]], [[college]] or work based training.&lt;ref name=2013proposal1/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013proposal2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/nov/10/schools.uk |title=Brown backs idea of raising school-leaving age |work=The Guardian |date=10 November 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 80% of 16-year-olds stay in full-time academic or vocational education, or go on a government-financed training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8559710?story_id=8559710 |title=School-leaving age: Staying on |publisher=The Economist |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 859 people, 9/10 supported the plans for the age increase.&lt;ref name=crimeprevention_guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544799/Education-until-18-will-prevent-life-of-crime.html |title=Education until 18 will prevent life of crime |work=The Telegraph |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NEET graph.png|thumb|left|250px| Proportion of 16-18 year olds in Education &amp; training, employment and [[NEET]].&lt;ref name=neet-oct06&gt;http://readingroom.lsc.gov.uk/lsc/National/45_-_2006_NEET.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reports published by the DfES showed that although there are around 70% of 16 year olds who remain in full-time education, this declines to less than 50% by the time they reach 18, with the majority finding unskilled employment and even fewer going into employment where their training has relevance. There is also a small increase in those who become unemployed by the time they reach 18, which the government hoped to reduce with the act.&lt;ref name=economistref1/&gt; It is these cases of unemployment which the government believes to be the toughest, whom it classifies as [[NEET]] ('''N'''ot in '''E'''ducation, '''E'''mployment or '''T'''raining). In 2006 an additional 7% of 16 year olds fell into this category and the proportion rose to 13% among 18 year olds.&lt;ref name=economistref1/&gt;  In practice, only 1% of young people are classified as NEET during their time aged 16‚Äì18, due to [[Churn rate|churn]] between training, employment and NEET classification.&lt;ref name=neet-oct06/&gt; In 2015 the percentage of 16-18 classified as NEET fell to 7.5%, the lowest figure since 2000.&lt;ref name=2015-figures&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/454401/Quarterly_Brief_NEET_Q2_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The government believed that the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find [[employment]]. The number of unskilled jobs available fell from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour.

====Opposition====
Whilst the government is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal,&lt;ref name=rosla18truancy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-508001/Plan-raise-school-leaving-age-18-leave-thousands-worthless-qualifications.html |title=Plan to raise school leaving age to 18 'will leave thousands with worthless qualifications' |work=Daily Mail |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; some on civil liberties grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin/article1564029.ece Sentenced to rot in their failed schools] Sunday Times, 25 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory school attendance is usually justified by reference to the argument that [[Minor (law)|minors]] are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a grey area, being regarded as effectively adult in a number of contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. [[Scots law|Scotland]]), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.

The proposal of using [[Criminal justice|criminal sanctions]] to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs from both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation.&lt;ref name=education_until_18/&gt; A spokesperson for the [[DfES]] said the proposals were not about "forcing young people to do something they don't want to", and that "we are letting young people down if we allow them to leave education and training without skills at the age of 16."&lt;ref name=2013opposition1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6740701.stm Staying on 'must not be forced'] news.bbc.co.uk, 11 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Prime Minister's [[Queen's Speech]] in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s or [[community service]], rather than [[prison|custodial sentencing]] which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age.&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"/&gt;

====Effects====
The downward trend in the number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find [[Skilled worker|skilled employment]]. Speaking in March 2007, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a [[Education Maintenance Allowance|training allowance]] to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of [[apprenticeship]]s available to double to around 500,000 by 2020,&lt;ref name=apprenticeships&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546322/School-leaving-age-will-be-raised-to-18.html |title=School leaving age will be raised to 18 |work=Telegraph.co.uk |date=23 March 2007 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"/&gt;

A skills commission report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP [[Barry Sheerman]], suggests that young people were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/barry-sheerman-backs-skills-commission-6356061 |title=Barry Sheerman backs Skills Commission report that says young people are being let down the education system |work=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government were hopeful that the changes would have an effect on preventing the increase in [[Crime prevention|crime levels]], as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.&lt;ref name=crimeprevention_guardian/&gt;

'''Reflective practice''' is the ability to reflect on one's actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning.&lt;ref name="Schon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sch√∂n |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald Sch√∂n |date=1983 |title=The reflective practitioner: how professionals think in action |location=New York |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=046506874X |oclc=8709452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one definition it involves "paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively.

Reflective practice can be an important tool in [[practice-based professional learning]] settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from [[formal learning]] or [[knowledge transfer]]. It may be the most important source of personal [[professional development]] and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice; through reflection a person is able to see and label forms of thought and theory within the context of his or her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McBrien |first=Barry |date=July 2007 |title=Learning from practice‚Äîreflections on a critical incident |journal=[[Accident and Emergency Nursing]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=128‚Äì133 |doi=10.1016/j.aaen.2007.03.004 |pmid=17540574}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who reflects throughout his or her practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to his or her existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paterson |first1=Colin |last2=Chapman |first2=Judith |date=August 2013 |title=Enhancing skills of critical reflection to evidence learning in professional practice |journal=Physical Therapy in Sport |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=133‚Äì138 |doi=10.1016/j.ptsp.2013.03.004 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Judith_Chapman4/publication/236637498_Enhancing_skills_of_critical_reflection_to_evidence_learning_in_professional_practice/links/540992db0cf2822fb739aff7.pdf |pmid=23643448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
[[File:Donald schon pic.jpg|thumb|right|Donald Sch√∂n]]
[[Donald Sch√∂n]]'s 1983 book ''The Reflective Practitioner'' introduced concepts such as ''reflection-on-action'' and ''reflection-in-action'' which explain how professionals meet the challenges of their work with a kind of [[improvisation]] that is improved through practice.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt; However, the concepts underlying reflective practice are much older. Earlier in the 20th century, [[John Dewey]] was among the first to write about reflective practice with his exploration of experience, interaction and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dewey |first=John |authorlink=John Dewey |date=1998 |origyear=1933 |title=How we think: a restatement of the relation of reflective thinking to the educative process |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |isbn=0395897548 |oclc=38878663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, other researchers such as [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Jean Piaget]] were developing relevant theories of human learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alice Y. |last1=Kolb |first2=David A. |last2=Kolb |authorlink2=David A. Kolb |year=2005 |title=Learning styles and learning spaces: enhancing experiential learning in higher education |journal=[[Academy of Management Learning and Education]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=193‚Äì212 |citeseerx=10.1.1.127.6489 |doi=10.5465/AMLE.2005.17268566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have claimed to find precursors of reflective practice in ancient texts such as [[Buddhist]] teachings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=Richard |date=March 2003 |title=Buddhism and action research: towards an appropriate model of inquiry for the caring professions |journal=Educational Action Research |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=141‚Äì160 |doi=10.1080/09650790300200208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Meditations]]'' of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suibhne |first=Seamus Mac |date=September 2009 |title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner |journal=Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=429‚Äì436 |doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the development of reflective theory was interest in the integration of theory and practice, the cyclic pattern of experience and the conscious application of lessons learned from experience. Since the 1970s, there has been a growing literature and focus around [[experiential learning]] and the development and application of reflective practice.

As [[adult education]] professor David Boud and his colleagues explained: "Reflection is an important human activity in which people recapture their experience, think about it, mull it over and evaluate it. It is this working with experience that is important in learning."&lt;ref name="Boud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boud |first1=David |last2=Keogh |first2=Rosemary |last3=Walker |first3=David |date=1985 |title=Reflection, turning experience into learning |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Kogan Page]]; Nichols |isbn=0893972029 |oclc=11030218 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BGUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is experiencing something, he or she may be [[implicit learning|implicitly learning]]; however, it can be difficult to put emotions, events, and thoughts into a coherent sequence of events. When a person rethinks or retells events, it is possible to categorize events, emotions, ideas, etc., and to compare the intended purpose of a past action with the results of the action. Stepping back from the action permits [[critical reflection]] on a sequence of events.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"/&gt;

The emergence in more recent years of [[blogging]] has been seen as another form of reflection on experience in a technological age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wopereis |first1=Iwan G.J.H. |last2=Sloep |first2=Peter B. |last3=Poortman |first3=Sybilla H. |title=Weblogs as instruments for reflection on action in teacher education |journal=Interactive Learning Environments |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=245‚Äì261 |year=2010 |doi=10.1080/10494820.2010.500530 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Sloep/publication/220095297_Weblogs_as_instruments_for_reflection_on_action_in_teacher_education/links/02bfe50fd8c738b584000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many models of reflective practice have been created to guide [[reasoning]] about action.

[[File:Steph Rol Model.jpg|thumb|Terry Borton's reflective model (1970), as adapted by Gary Rolfe and colleagues (2001)]]
Terry Borton's 1970 book ''Reach, Touch, and Teach'' popularized a simple [[learning cycle]] inspired by [[Gestalt therapy]] composed of three questions which ask the practitioner: ''What'', ''So what'', and ''Now what''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Borton |first=Terry |date=1970 |title=Reach, touch, and teach: student concerns and process education |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |oclc=178000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this analysis, a description of a situation is given which then leads into the scrutiny of the situation and the construction of knowledge that has been learnt through the experience. Subsequently, practitioners reflect on ways in which they can personally improve and the consequences of their response to the experience. Borton's model was later adapted by practitioners outside the field of education, such as the field of nursing and the helping professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rolfe |first1=Gary |last2=Freshwater |first2=Dawn |last3=Jasper |first3=Melanie |date=2001 |title=Critical reflection for nursing and the helping professions: a user's guide |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan|Palgrave]] |isbn=0333777956 |oclc=46984997 |pages=26‚Äì35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kolb and Fry 1975===
[[File:Steph Kol Model.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of Kolb's reflective model]]
Learning theorist [[David A. Kolb]] was highly influenced by the earlier research conducted by [[John Dewey]] and [[Jean Piaget]]. Kolb's reflective model highlights the concept of [[experiential learning]] and is centered on the transformation of information into knowledge. This takes place after a situation has occurred, and entails a practitioner reflecting on the experience, gaining a general understanding of the concepts encountered during the experience, and then testing these general understandings in a new situation. In this way, the knowledge that is formed from a situation is continuously applied and reapplied, building on a practitioner's prior experiences and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolb |first1=David A. |authorlink1=David A. Kolb |last2=Fry |first2=Ronald E. |date=1975 |chapter=Towards an applied theory of experiential learning |editor-last=Cooper |editor-first=Cary L. |title=Theories of group processes |series=Wiley series on individuals, groups, and organizations |location=London; New York |publisher=Wiley |pages=33‚Äì58 |isbn=0471171174 |oclc=1103318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argyris and Sch√∂n 1978===

[[Management]] researchers [[Chris Argyris]] and [[Donald Sch√∂n]] pioneered the idea of ''single-loop learning'' and ''[[double-loop learning]]'' in 1978.

Sch√∂n claimed to derive the notions of "reflection-on-action, reflection-in-action, responding to problematic situations, problem framing, problem solving, and the priority of practical knowledge over abstract theory" from the writings of [[John Dewey]], although education professor Harvey Shapiro has argued that Dewey's writings offer "more expansive, more integrated notions of professional growth" than do Sch√∂n's.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Harvey |date=2010 |title=John Dewey's reception in 'Sch√∂nian' reflective practice |journal=Philosophy of Education Archive |pages=311‚Äì319 [311] |url=http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes/article/view/3049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schon advocated 2 types of reflective practice. Firstly, reflection-on-action, which involves reflecting on an experience that you have already had, or an action that you have already taken, and considering what could have been done differently, as well as looking at the positives from that interaction. The other type of reflection Schon notes is reflection-in-action, or reflecting on your actions as you are doing them, and considering issues like best practice throughout the process.

For Sch√∂n, professional growth really begins when a person starts to view things with a critical lens, by doubting his or her actions. [[Doubt]] brings about a way of thinking that questions and frames situations as "problems". Through careful planning and systematic elimination of other possible problems, doubt is settled, and people are able to affirm their knowledge of the situation. Then people are able to think about possible situations and their outcomes, and deliberate about whether they carried out the right actions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Johns 1995===
[[File:Steph Joh Model2.jpg|thumb|Adaptation of the Johns reflective model]]
Professor of nursing Christopher Johns designed a structured mode of reflection that provides a practitioner with a guide to gain greater understanding of his or her practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Christopher |last2=Burnie |first2=Sally |date=2013 |origyear=2000 |title=Becoming a reflective practitioner |edition=4th |location=Chichester, UK; Ames, Iowa |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=9780470674260 |oclc=823139850 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWifyeS9ol0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to be carried out through the act of sharing with a colleague or mentor, which enables the experience to become learnt knowledge at a faster rate than reflection alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Johns |editor-first=Christopher |date=2010 |origyear=2002 |title=Guided reflection: a narrative approach to advancing professional practice |edition=2nd |location=Chichester, UK; Ames, Iowa |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=9781405185684 |oclc=502392750 |doi=10.1002/9781444324969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf-3GyLX1QwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns highlights the importance of experienced knowledge and the ability of a practitioner to access, understand and put into practice information that has been acquired through empirical means. Reflection occurs though "looking in" on one's thoughts and emotions and "looking out" at the situation experienced. Johns draws on the work of Barbara Carper to expand on the notion of "looking out" at a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Barbara A. |last1=Carper |title=Fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing |date=October 1978 |journal=Advances in Nursing Science |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13‚Äì24 |doi=10.1097/00012272-197810000-00004 |pmid=110216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five [[Carper's fundamental ways of knowing|patterns of knowing]] are incorporated into the guided reflection: the aesthetic, personal, ethical, empirical and reflexive aspects of the situation. Johns' model is comprehensive and allows for reflection that touches on many important elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johns |first1=Christopher |title=Framing learning through reflection within Carper's fundamental ways of knowing in nursing |journal=[[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=226‚Äì234 |date=August 1995 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1995.22020226.x |pmid=7593941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brookfield 1998===
[[Adult education]] scholar [[Stephen Brookfield]] proposed that critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the lens of their autobiography as learners of reflective practice, the lens of other learners' eyes, the lens of colleagues' experiences, and the lens of theoretical, philosophical and research literature.&lt;ref name="Brookfield1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brookfield |first=Stephen D. |authorlink=Stephen Brookfield |title=Critically reflective practice |journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions |date=Autumn 1998 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=197‚Äì205 |doi=10.1002/chp.1340180402 |url=http://library.sau.edu/committee/brookfieldCritically.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093458/http://library.sau.edu/committee/brookfieldCritically.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us more aware of the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions‚Äîassumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run.&lt;ref name="Brookfield1998"/&gt; Brookfield argued that these four lenses will reflect back to us starkly different pictures of who we are and what we do.
* ''Lens 1: Our autobiography as a learner''. Our autobiography is an important source of insight into practice. As we talk to each other about critical events in our practice, we start to realize that individual crises are usually collectively experienced dilemmas. Analysing our autobiographies allows us to draw insight and meanings for practice on a deep visceral emotional level.
* ''Lens 2: Our learners' eyes''. Seeing ourselves through learners' eyes, we may discover that learners are interpreting our actions in the way that we mean them. But often we are surprised by the diversity of meanings people read into our words and actions. A cardinal principle of seeing ourselves through learners' eyes is that of ensuring the anonymity of their critical opinions. We have to make learners feel safe. Seeing our practice through learners' eyes helps us teach more responsively.
* ''Lens 3: Our colleagues' experiences''. Our colleagues serve as critical mirrors reflecting back to us images of our actions. Talking to colleagues about problems and gaining their perspective increases our chance of finding some information that can help our situation.
* ''Lens 4: Theoretical literature''. Theory can help us "name" our practice by illuminating the general elements of what we think are idiosyncratic experiences.

==Application==
Reflective practice has been described as an unstructured or semi-structured approach directing learning, and a self-regulated process commonly used in health and teaching professions, though applicable to all professions.&lt;ref name="Schon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larrivee |first1=Barbara |title=Transforming teaching practice: becoming the critically reflective teacher |journal=Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=293‚Äì307 |year=2000 |doi=10.1080/713693162 |url=http://ed253jcu.pbworks.com/f/Larrivee_B_2000CriticallyReflectiveTeacher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective practice is a learning process taught to professionals from a variety of disciplines, with the aim of enhancing abilities to communicate and making informed and balanced decisions. Professional associations such as the [[American Association of Nurse Practitioners]] are recognizing the importance of reflective practice and require practitioners to prepare reflective portfolios as a requirement to be licensed, and for yearly quality assurance purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Education===
The concept of reflective practice has found wide application in the field of education, for learners, teachers and those who teach teachers. Hadiya Habib(2017) assert that there is one quality above all that makes a good teacher -the ability to reflect on what, why and how we do things and to adopt and develop our practice within lifelong learning. Reflection is the key to successful learning for teachers and for learners.

====Students====
Students can benefit from engaging in reflective practice as it can foster the critical thinking and decision making necessary for continuous learning and improvement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Portfolio Organizer: Succeeding with Portfolios in your Classroom|last = Rolheiser, C.  Bower, B.  Stevahn, L|first = |publisher = Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.|year = 2000|isbn = |location = Alexandria, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When students are engaged in reflection, they are thinking about how their work meets established criteria; they analyze the effectiveness of their efforts, and plan for improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rolheiser and et al. (2000) assert that "Reflection is linked to elements that are fundamental to meaningful learning and cognitive development: the development of metacognition ‚Äì the capacity for students to improve their ability to think about their thinking; the ability to self-evaluate - the capacity for students to judge the quality of their work based on evidence and explicit criteria for the purpose of doing better work; the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making; and the enhancement of teacher understanding of the learner." (p 31-32)

When teachers teach metacognitive skills, it promotes student self-monitoring and self-regulation that can lead to intellectual growth, increase academic achievement, and support transfer of skills so that students are able to use any strategy at any time and for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.edugains.ca/resourcesCurrImpl/Secondary/FSL/SupplementaryMaterials/ConnectingPracticeandResearchMetacognitionGuide.pdf|title = Connecting Practice and Research: Metacognition Guide|date = 2008|accessdate = |website = Connecting Practice and Research: Metacognition Guide|publisher = Queens Printer|last = Ontario Ministry of Education|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guiding students in the habits of reflection requires teachers to approach their role as that of "facilitator of [[meaning-making]]" ‚Äì they organize instruction and classroom practice so that students are the producers, not just the consumers, of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning and leading with habits of mind: 16 essential characteristics for success.|last = Costa, A., Kallick, B.|first = |publisher = Association for supervision and Curriculum Development|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Alexandria, VA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolheiser and colleagues (2000) state that "When students develop their capacity to understand their own thinking processes, they are better equipped to employ the necessary cognitive skills to complete a task or achieve a goal. Students who have acquired metacognitive skills are better able to compensate for both low ability and insufficient information." (p.&amp;nbsp;34)

The Ontario Ministry of Education (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/studentselfassessment.pdf|title = Capacity Building Series: Student Self Assessment|date = 2007|accessdate = |website = Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat Capacity Building Series|publisher = Queens Printer|last = Ontario Ministry of Education|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes many ways in which educators can help students acquire the skills required for effective reflection and self-assessment, including: modelling and/or intentionally teaching critical thinking skills necessary for reflection and self-assessment practices; addressing students' perceptions of self-assessment; engaging in discussion and dialogue about why self-assessment is important; allowing time to learn self-assessment and reflection skills; providing many opportunities to practice different aspects of the self-assessment and reflection process; and ensuring that parents/guardians understand that self-assessment is only one of a variety of assessment strategies that is utilized for student learning.

====Teachers====
The concept of reflective practice is now widely employed in the field of teacher education and teacher professional development and many programmes of initial teacher education claim to espouse it.&lt;ref name="Loughran"/&gt; In education, a minimalist understanding of reflective practice is that it refers to the process of the educator studying his or her own teaching methods and determining what works best for the students and the consideration of the ethical consequences of classroom procedures on students; a broader understanding would accept that it also involves questioning the organisational, social and political context in which the teaching takes place.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt; Education professor Hope Hartman has described reflective practice in education as teacher [[metacognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartman |first=Hope J. |date=2001 |chapter=Teaching metacognitively |editor-last=Hartman |editor-first=Hope J. |title=Metacognition in learning and instruction: theory, research, and practice |series=Neuropsychology and cognition |volume=19 |location=Dordrecht; Boston |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |pages=149‚Äì172 |isbn=079236838X |oclc=45655382 |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2243-8_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is broad consensus that teaching effectively requires a reflective approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hatton |first1=Neville |last2=Smith |first2=David |date=January 1995 |title=Reflection in teacher education: towards definition and implementation |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33‚Äì49 |doi=10.1016/0742-051X(94)00012-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cochran-Smith |first=Marilyn |date=January 2003 |title=Learning and unlearning: the education of teacher educators |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=5‚Äì28 |doi=10.1016/S0742-051X(02)00091-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Jones |first2=Karrie A. |date=January 2013 |title=Teaching reflective practice: implementation in the teacher-education setting |journal=The Teacher Educator |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=73‚Äì85 |doi=10.1080/08878730.2012.740153 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08878730.2012.740153 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reflective practice "is a term that carries diverse meaning"&lt;ref name="Loughran"/&gt; and about which there is not complete consensus.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leitch |first1=Ruth |last2=Day |first2=Christopher |date=March 2000 |title=Action research and reflective practice: towards a holistic view |journal=Educational Action Research |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=179‚Äì193 |doi=10.1080/09650790000200108 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09650790000200108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davey |first1=Ronnie |last2=Ham |first2=Vince |date=March 2010 |title='It's all about paying attention!' ‚Ä¶ but to what?

As professor of education Barbara Larrivee argues, reflective practice moves teachers from their knowledge base of distinct skills to a stage in their careers where they are able to modify their skills to suit specific contexts and situations, and eventually to invent new strategies.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt; In implementing a process of reflective practice teachers will be able to move themselves, and their schools, beyond existing theories in practice.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2000"/&gt; Larrivee concludes that teachers should "resist establishing a classroom culture of control and become a reflective practitioner, continuously engaging in a critical reflection, consequently remaining fluid in the dynamic environment of the classroom".&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt;

[[Video]] recordings of classroom activities have been used to help trainee teachers / education interns develop more detailed reflective practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosaen |first1=Cheryl L. |last2=Lundeberg |first2=Mary |last3=Cooper |first3=Marjorie |last4=Fritzen |first4=Anny |last5=Terpstra |first5=Marjorie |date=September 2008 |title=Noticing noticing: how does investigation of video records change how teachers reflect on their experiences? |journal=[[Journal of Teacher Education]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=347‚Äì360 |doi=10.1177/0022487108322128 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheryl_Rosaen/publication/230853172_Noticing_Noticing/links/0deec53c9731066097000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to physiotherapists Colin Paterson and Judith Chapman, reflection or learning from experience is key to staying accountable, and maintaining and developing aptitude throughout a teacher's practice.&lt;ref name="paterson-chapman"/&gt; Without reflection, teachers are not able to look objectively at their actions or take into account the emotions, experience, or consequences of actions to improve their practice. It is argued that, through the process of reflection, teachers are held accountable to the standards of practice for teaching, such as those in [[Ontario]]: commitment to students and student learning, professional knowledge, professional practice, leadership in learning communities, and ongoing [[Professional learning community|professional learning]].&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards of practice |publisher=[[Ontario College of Teachers]] |url=http://www.oct.ca/public/professional-standards/standards-of-practice |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through reflective practice, teachers look back on their practice and reflect on how they have supported students by treating them "equitably and with respect and are sensitive to factors that influence individual student learning".&lt;ref name="Ontario"/&gt; By doing this, teachers ask themselves: "Have I to the best of my abilities supported student learning, and provided all of my students with an entry point into learning?" Through reflection, and sharing their reflection, teachers show strong leadership because they show that they are willing to learn from their mistakes and improve their practice for everyone affected by it.&lt;ref name="Ontario"/&gt;

====Teacher educators====

For students to acquire necessary skills in reflection, their teachers need to be able to teach and model reflective practice (see above); similarly, teachers themselves need to have been taught reflective practice during their initial teacher education, and to continue to develop their reflective skills throughout their career.

However, Mary Ryan has noted that students are often asked to "reflect" without being taught how to do so,&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Ryan, M. (2013) 'The pedagogical balancing act: teaching reflection in higher education', Teaching in Higher Education, 18:2, pp 144-155&lt;/ref&gt; or without being taught that different types of reflection are possible; they may not even receive a clear definition or rationale for reflective practice.&lt;ref name="Hebert"&gt;H√©bert, C. (2015) 'Knowing and/or experiencing: a critical examination of the reflective models of John Dewey and Donald Sch√∂n', Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt; Many new teachers do not know how to transfer the reflection strategies they learned in college to their classroom teaching.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, J.L. and Jones, K.A. (2013): 'Teaching Reflective Practice: Implementation in the Teacher-Education Setting'; The Teacher Educator, 48 p.1, 73-85)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have advocated that reflective practice needs to be taught explicitly to student teachers because it is not an intuitive act;&lt;ref name="Will"&gt;Williams, R. and Grudnoff, L. (2011) "Making sense of reflection: a comparison of beginning and experienced teachers' perceptions of reflection for practice". Reflective practice: international and multidisciplinary perspectives, 9, 177-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; it is not enough for teacher educators to provide student teachers with "opportunities" to reflect: they must explicitly "teach reflection and types of reflection" and "need explicitly to facilitate the process of reflection and make transparent the metacognitive process it entails".&lt;ref name="Nagle"&gt;Nagle JF (2008), 'Becoming a Reflective Practitioner in the Age of Accountability', The Educational Forum, 73 p.1, 76-86&lt;/ref&gt; Larrivee notes that (student) teachers require "carefully constructed guidance" and "multifaceted and strategically constructed interventions" if they are to reflect effectively on their practice.&lt;ref name="Larrivee 2000"/&gt;

Rod Lane and colleageues list strategies by which teacher educators can promote a habit of reflective practice in pre-service teachers, such as discussions of a teaching situation, reflective interviews or essays about one's teaching experiences, action research, or journaling or blogging.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Lane, R., McMaster, H., Adnum J., and Cavanagh, M. (2014) 'Quality reflective practice in teacher education: a journey towards shared understanding,' Reflective Practice: International and Multidisciplinary Perspectives, 15 p.4, 481-494 [282]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville Hatton and David Smith, in a brief literature review, conclude that teacher education programmes do use a wide range of strategies with the aim of encouraging students teachers to reflect (e.g. action research, case studies, video-recording or supervised practicum experiences), but that "there is little research evidence to show that this [aim] is actually being achieved".&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton N and Smith D (1995), 'Reflection in Teacher Education: towards definition and implementation', Teaching &amp; Teacher Education, Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 33-49 [36]&lt;/ref&gt;

The implication of all this is that teacher educators must also be highly skilled in reflective practice. Andrea Gelfuso and Danielle Dennis, in a report on a formative experiment with student teachers, suggest that teaching how to reflect requires teacher educators to possess and deploy specific competences.&lt;ref name="Gelfuso"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gelfuso A., Dennis D. | year = 2014 | title = Getting reflection off the page: the challenges of developing support structures for pre-service teacher reflection | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1‚Äì11 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2013.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janet Dyment and Timothy O'Connell, in a small-scale study of experienced teacher educators, noted that the teacher educators they studied had received no training in using reflection themselves, and that they in turn did not give such training to their students; all parties were expected to know how to reflect.&lt;ref name="Dyment"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dyment J.E., O'Connell T.S. | year = 2014 | title = When the Ink Runs Dry: Implications for Theory and Practice When Educators Stop Keeping Reflective Journals | url = | journal = Innovation in HE | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 417‚Äì429 | doi=10.1007/s10755-014-9291-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers advocate for teacher educators themselves to act as models of reflective practice.&lt;ref name="Lough"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loughran J., Berry A. | year = 2005 | title = Modelling by teacher educators | url = | journal = Teaching and Teacher Education | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 193‚Äì203 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2004.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russ"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Russell T | year = 2013 | title = Has Reflective Practice Done More Harm than Good in Teacher Education? | url = | journal = Phronesis | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 80‚Äì88 | doi=10.7202/1015641ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the way that teacher educators teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; teacher educators should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that teacher educators need to be aware of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory.&lt;ref name="swennen"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Swennen A., Lunenberg M., Korthagen F. | year = 2008 | title = Preach what you teach!

Tom Russell, in a reflective article looking back on 35 years as teacher educator, concurs that teacher educators rarely model reflective practice, fail to link reflection clearly and directly to professional learning, and rarely explain what they mean by reflection, with the result that student teachers may complete their initial teacher education with "a muddled and negative view of what reflection is and how it might contribute to their professional learning".&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, T. (2013) 'Has Reflective Practice Done More Harm than Good in Teacher Education?' Phronesis, 2(1), pp. 80-88&lt;/ref&gt; For Russell, these problems result from the fact that teacher educators have not sufficiently explored how theories of reflective practice relate to their own teaching, and so have not made the necessary "paradigmatic changes" which they expect their students to make.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;

===Health professionals===
Reflective practice is viewed as an important strategy for health professionals who embrace lifelong learning. Due to the ever-changing context of healthcare and the continual growth of medical knowledge, there is a high level of demand on healthcare professionals' expertise. Due to this complex and continually changing environment, healthcare professionals could benefit from a program of reflective practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hendricks |first1=Joyce |last2=Mooney |first2=Deborah |last3=Berry |first3=Catherine |date=April 1996 |title=A practical strategy approach to use of reflective practice in critical care nursing |journal=Intensive and Critical Care Nursing |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=97‚Äì101 |doi=10.1016/S0964-3397(96)81042-1 |pmid=8845631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrienne Price explained that there are several reasons why a healthcare practitioner would engage in reflective practice: to further understand one's motives, perceptions, attitudes, values, and feelings associated with client care; to provide a fresh outlook to practice situations and to challenge existing thoughts, feelings, and actions; and to explore how the practice situation may be approached differently.&lt;ref name="Price 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Adrienne |date=August 2004 |title=Encouraging reflection and critical thinking in practice |journal=Nursing Standard |volume=18 |issue=47 |pages=46‚Äì52 |doi=10.7748/ns2004.08.18.47.46.c3664}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of nursing there is concern that actions may run the risk of habitualisation, thus dehumanising patients and their needs.&lt;ref name="Walker1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=Susan |title=Reflective practice in the accident and emergency setting |journal=[[Accident and Emergency Nursing]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27‚Äì30 |date=January 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0965-2302(96)90034-X |pmid=8696852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using reflective practice, nurses are able to plan their actions and consciously monitor the action to ensure it is beneficial to their patient.&lt;ref name="Walker1996"/&gt;

The act of reflection is seen as a way of promoting the development of autonomous, qualified and self-directed professionals, as well as a way of developing more effective healthcare teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghaye |first=Tony |date=2005 |title=Developing the reflective healthcare team |location=Oxford; Malden, MA |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |isbn=1405105917 |oclc=58478682 |doi=10.1002/9780470774694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaging in reflective practice is associated with improved quality of care, stimulating personal and professional growth and closing the gap between theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jasper |first=Melanie |date=2013 |origyear=2003 |title=Beginning reflective practice |series=Nursing and health care practice series |edition=2nd |location=Andover |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781408075265 |oclc=823552537}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} Medical practitioners can combine reflective practice with [[checklist]]s (when appropriate) to reduce diagnostic error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Graber |first1=Mark L. |last2=Kissam |first2=Stephanie |last3=Payne |first3=Velma L. |last4=Meyer |first4=Ashley N. D. |last5=Sorensen |first5=Asta |last6=Lenfestey |first6=Nancy |last7=Tant |first7=Elizabeth |last8=Henriksen |first8=Kerm |last9=LaBresh |first9=Kenneth |last10=Singh |first10=Hardeep |date=July 2012 |title=Cognitive interventions to reduce diagnostic error: a narrative review |journal=[[BMJ Quality &amp; Safety]] |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=535‚Äì557 |doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2011-000149 |pmid=22543420 |url=http://www.ajustnhs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cog-interventions-diag-error-graber-BMJ-QS-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities to promote reflection are now being incorporated into undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education across a variety of health professions.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Karen |last2=Gordon |first2=Jill |last3=MacLeod |first3=Anna |date=November 2007 |title=Reflection and reflective practice in health professions education: a systematic review |journal=Advances in Health Sciences Education |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=595‚Äì621 |doi=10.1007/s10459-007-9090-2 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jill_Gordon/publication/5813985_Reflection_and_reflective_practice_in_health_professions_education_a_systematic_review/links/0c960517f54e18b6dd000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of medical education Karen Mann and her colleagues found through a 2009 literature review that in practising professionals the process of reflection appears to include a number of different aspects, and practicing professionals vary in their tendency and ability to reflect. They noted that the evidence to support curricular interventions and innovations promoting reflective practice remains largely theoretical.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

Samantha Davies identified benefits as well as limitations to reflective practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies |first=Samantha |title=Embracing reflective practice |journal=Education for Primary Care |date=January 2012 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=9‚Äì12 |pmid=22306139 |doi=10.1080/14739879.2012.11494064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits to reflective practice include:
* Increased learning from an experience or situation
* Promotion of deep learning
* Identification of personal and professional strengths and areas for improvement
* Identification of educational needs
* Acquisition of new knowledge and skills
* Further understanding of own beliefs, attitudes and values
* Encouragement of self-motivation and self-directed learning
* Could act as a source of feedback
* Possible improvements of personal and clinical confidence

Limitations to reflective practice include:
* Not all practitioners may understand the reflective process
* May feel uncomfortable challenging and evaluating own practice
* Could be time consuming
* May have confusion as to which situations/experiences to reflect upon
* May not be adequate to resolve clinical problems&lt;ref name="Price 2004"/&gt;

===Environmental management and sustainability===
The use of reflective practice in [[environmental management]], combined with [[system monitoring]], is often called ''[[adaptive management]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salafsky |first1=Nick Redford |last2=Margoluis |first2=Richard |last3=Redford |first3=Kent Hubbard |date=2001 |title=Adaptive management: a tool for conservation practitioners |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Biodiversity Support Program |oclc=48381963 |url=http://www.fosonline.org/resource/am-tool}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some criticism that traditional environmental management, which simply focuses on the problem at hand, fails to integrate into the decision making the wider systems within which an environment is situated.&lt;ref name="Bryant 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bryant |first1=Raymond L. |last2=Wilson |first2=Geo A. |title=Rethinking environmental management |journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]] |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=321‚Äì343 |date=June 1998 |doi=10.1191/030913298672031592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While research and science must inform the process of environmental management, it is up to the practitioner to integrate those results within these wider systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fazey |first1=Ioan |last2=Fazey |first2=John A. |last3=Salisbury |first3=Janet G. |last4=Lindenmayer |first4=David B. |last5=Dovers |first5=Steve |title=The nature and role of experiential knowledge for environmental conservation |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=33 |pages=1 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S037689290600275X |url=http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/1629/1/Fazey2006EnvironmentalConservation33ExperientialKnowledge.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to deal with this and to reaffirm the utility of environmental management, Bryant and Wilson propose that a "more reflective approach is required that seeks to rethink the basic premises of environmental management as a process".&lt;ref name="Bryant 1998"/&gt; This style of approach has been found to be successful in [[sustainable development]] projects where participants appreciated and enjoyed the educational aspect of utilising reflective practice throughout. However, the authors noted the challenges with melding the "circularity" of reflective practice theory with the "doing" of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Simon |last2=Morse |first2=Stephen |title=Delivering sustainability therapy in sustainable development projects |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=37‚Äì51 |year=2005 |pmid=15748802 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2004.11.006 |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/120/1/Deliv._Sus_Bell__Morse_JEM051.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership positions===
Reflective practice provides a development opportunity for those in leadership positions. Managing a team of people requires a delicate balance between people skills and technical expertise, and success in this type of role does not come easily. Reflective practice provides leaders with an opportunity to critically review what has been successful in the past and where improvement can be made.

Reflective learning organizations have invested in [[coaching]] programs for their emerging and established leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avolio |first1=Bruce J. |last2=Avey |first2=James B. |last3=Quisenberry |first3=David |date=August 2010 |title=Estimating return on leadership development investment |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=633‚Äì644 |doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.06.006 |url=http://uwtv.org/files/2013/01/roldleaqua650.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders frequently engage in self-limiting behaviours because of their over-reliance on their preferred ways of reacting and responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turesky |first1=Elizabeth Fisher |last2=Gallagher |first2=Dennis |title=Know thyself: coaching for leadership using Kolb's experiential learning theory |journal=The Coaching Psychologist |date=June 2011 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=5‚Äì14 |url=http://people.usm.maine.edu/eturesky/Articles/KnowThyself.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching can help support the establishment of new behaviours, as it encourages reflection, critical thinking and transformative learning. Adults have acquired a body of experience throughout their life, as well as habits of mind that define their world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mezirow |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Mezirow |title=Transformative learning: theory to practice |journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education |date=Summer 1997 |volume=74 |pages=5‚Äì12 |doi=10.1002/ace.7401 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ntzcl1/literature/elearning/mezirow.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching programs support the process of questioning and potentially rebuilding these pre-determined habits of mind. The goal is for leaders to maximize their professional potential, and in order to do this, there must be a process of critical reflection on current assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helsing |first1=Deborah |last2=Howell |first2=Annie |last3=Kegan |first3=Robert |authorlink3=Robert Kegan |last4=Lahey |first4=Lisa Laskow |title=Putting the 'development' in professional development: understanding and overturning educational leaders' immunities to change |date=Fall 2008 |journal=[[Harvard Educational Review]] |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=437‚Äì465 |url=http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/cms/lib07/MA01906464/Centricity/Domain/142/Kegan%20-%20Putting%20the%20Professional%20Development%20in%20PD.pdf |ref=harv |doi=10.17763/haer.78.3.888l759g1qm54660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other professions===
Reflective practice can help any individual to develop personally, and is useful for professions other than those discussed above. It allows professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge and consider new ways to interact with their colleagues. David Somerville and June Keeling suggested eight simple ways that professionals can practice more reflectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Somerville |first1=David |last2=Keeling |first2=June |title=A practical approach to promote reflective practice within nursing |journal=[[Nursing Times]] |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=42‚Äì45 |date=24 March 2004 |pmid=15067912 |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/specialisms/educators/a-practical-approach-to-promote-reflective-practice-within-nursing/204502.article}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Seek feedback: Ask "Can you give me some feedback on what I did?"
# Ask yourself "What have I learnt today?" and ask others "What have you learnt today?"
# Value personal strengths: Identify positive accomplishments and areas for growth
# View experiences objectively: Imagine the situation is on stage and you are in the audience
# Empathize: Say out loud what you imagine the other person is experiencing
# Keep a journal: Record your thoughts, feelings and future plans; look for emerging patterns
# Plan for the future: Plan changes in behavior based on the patterns you identified
# Create your own future: Combine the virtues of the dreamer, the realist, and the critic

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Robots and Avatars''' was a programme of events and [[education]]al activities which explores how young people will work and play with new representational forms of virtual and physical life in 10‚Äì15 years time. It was produced by [[Body data space|body&gt;data&gt;space]] with support from [[National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts|NESTA]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanza.co.uk/emergentcity/?p=363&lt;/ref&gt; between 2009 and 2012.

The project examined multi-identity evolutions of younger generations within the context of a world in which virtual and physical spaces are increasingly blended. A participatory web and events led programme with connected educational activities took taking place across 2010 and onwards, in the UK and internationally. The project included contributions by a diverse range of experts, professionals and specialists working with robots and avatars including Professor [[Noel Sharkey]] (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and Professor of Public Engagement University of Sheffield), Pear Urishima (Apple), [[Ghislaine Boddington]] from body&gt;data&gt;space and [[Derek Richards]] from [[Hi8us]] South.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apengine.org/2010/06/robots-and-avatars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robots and Avatars Forum==
Robots and Avatars launched in November 2009 with a Forum at NESTA, attended by an international group of 80 experts, professionals and young people in [[London]].

==Robots and Avatars Lunch Debates==
Between June and November 2010 the programme hosted a series of Lunch Debates exploring Artificial Intelligence, Behaviour and Ethics, Health and Wellbeing and the Future Workplace with expert provocateurs and top level thinkers.

==The Overall Programme==
The programme continued throughout 2010-2011 with educational events, an [[exhibition]], a [[website]], [[vodcast]]s with key experts and a book/[[DVD]].

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science‚ÄîAbout|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students‚Äô STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students‚Äô interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students‚Äô STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''School choice''' is a term for [[K‚Äì12]] public education options in the [[United States]], describing a wide array of programs offering students and their families alternatives to [[Public school (government funded)|publicly provided schools]], to which students are generally assigned by the location of their family residence. In the United States, the most common‚Äîboth by number of programs and by number of participating students‚Äîschool choice programs are [[scholarship tax credit]] programs, which allow individuals or corporations to receive tax credits toward their state taxes in exchange for donations made to non-profit organizations that grant [[private school]] scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Choice Virtual Yearbook|url=http://www.createonline.com/Whats%20Inside.pdf|website=Alliance for School Choice|access-date=2014-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715002125/http://www.createonline.com/Whats%20Inside.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, a similar subsidy may be provided by the state through a [[school voucher]] program.  Other school choice options include open enrollment laws (which allow students to attend [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] outside the district in which the students live), [[charter school]]s, [[magnet schools]], [[virtual schools]], [[homeschooling]], education savings accounts (ESAs), and individual tax credits or deductions for educational expenses.

==History==
Economist and [[Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] proposed in 1955 using [[free market]] principles to improve the [[Education in the United States|United States public school system]]. The practice had been that children were assigned a public school based on where their parents live, which public schools were funded by state and local taxes. Friedman proposed that parents should be able to receive those education funds in the form of [[School voucher|vouchers]], which would allow them to choose their children's schools, including both public and private, religious and non-religious options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/The-Friedmans/The-Friedmans-on-School-Choice/The-Role-of-Government-in-Education-(1995).aspx|title=The Role of Government in Education|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996, Friedman and his wife economist [[Rose Director Friedman]] founded the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, (now [[EdChoice]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=33913|title=Friedman Foundation Calls for Tax Credits to Benefit K‚Äì12 Education|date=February 10, 2009|work=Inside Indiana Business|accessdate=12 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511122302/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=33913|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/rally-to-unite-public-310078.html|title=Rally to unite public, private groups that back vouchers|last=Dodd  |first=D.

The first use of school vouchers in the United States came in the form of state tuition grants provided by [[Virginia]]'s 1956 [[Stanley plan|Stanley Plan]], which financed white-only private schools known as [[segregation academies]]. Other states followed until the practice was disallowed by ''[[Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County]]'' (1964). While ''school choice'' has always implied school improvement, debates have regularly followed about the motivation and implementation.

==Forms==

=== Scholarship tax credits ===
{{main|Scholarship tax credit}}
States with scholarship tax credit programs grant individuals and/or businesses a credit, whether full or partial, toward their taxes for donations made to scholarship granting organizations (also called school tuition organizations). SGOs/STOs use the donations to create scholarships that are then given to help pay for the cost of tuition for students. These scholarships allow students to attend private schools or out-of-district public schools that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for many families. These programs currently exist in fourteen states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia in the [[#United States|United States]].&lt;ref name="School Choice Programs"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Choice Programs|url=http://www.edchoice.org/School-Choice/School-Choice-Programs|website=Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vouchers ===
{{main|School voucher}}
[[School voucher|Vouchers]] give students the opportunity to attend a private school of their choosing, secular or religious. This would be paid for by accessing all or part of the public funding set aside for their children‚Äôs education.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/|title=Types of School Choice - EdChoice|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charter schools ===
{{main|Charter school}}
Charter schools are independent public schools which are exempt from many of the state and local regulations which govern most public schools. These exemptions grant charter schools some autonomy and flexibility with decision-making, such as teacher union contracts, hiring, and curriculum. In return, charter schools are subject to stricter accountability on spending and academic performance. The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws, though they vary in how charter schools are approved. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, [[City Academy High School]], opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/ |title=Clinton touts success of public charter schools |date=2000-05-04 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821180747/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/04/education.debate/ |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of charter schools has increased with the support of the Obama Administration. Under the Administration, the Department of Education has provided funding incentives to states and school districts that increase the number of charter schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=I. Frankenberg II. Siegel-Hawley III. Wang|first=I. Erica II. Genevieve III. Jia|year=2011|title=Choice without equity: Charter school segregation|url=|journal=Education policy analysis archive|volume=19|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhere between 22 and 26% of Dayton, Ohio children are in charter schools.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/12/02/index.html|title=Catholic schools: Victims of choice|last=Elliot|first=Scott|date=2005-12-02|publisher=Dayton Daily News|accessdate=2008-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905062647/http://www.daytondailynews.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/dayton/education/entries/2005/12/02/index.html|archivedate=2008-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest percentage in the nation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%), and Arizona. Almost one in four public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.

Charter schools can also come in the form of cyber charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like all charter schools, cyber charters are public schools, but they are free from some of the rules and regulations that conventional public schools must follow.

=== Magnet schools ===
{{main|Magnet school}}
[[File:MA Public High School District Open Enrollment Status by town.png|thumb|250px|The Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] allows the school committees of public school districts to have open enrollment policies. Towns in Massachusetts represented by the "School Choice Receiving District Status" (open enrollment status) of their public high school district for the 2016-2017 academic year. Towns represented in blue have school districts with an open enrollment policy for kindergarten through high school. Towns represented in purple have school districts with open enrollment only for specific grades. Towns represented in red have school districts with a closed enrollment policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/finance/schoolchoice/|title=School Choice - School Finance|website=www.doe.mass.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology, or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, some (but not all) magnet schools require a test to get in. Magnet schools are an example of open enrollment programs. Open enrollment refers to district or statewide programs that allow families to choose public schools other than the ones they are assigned. Intradistrict open enrollment programs allow school choice within a district. Interdistrict open enrollment allows families to choose schools outside the district in other districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2013|title=School Choice in the States: A Policy Landscape|url=|journal=Council of Chief State School Officers|volume=|pages=|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home schooling ===
{{main|Homeschooling}}
"Home education" or "home schooling" is instruction in a child's home, or provided primarily by a parent, or under direct parental control. Informal home education has always taken place, and formal instruction in the home has at times also been very popular. As public education grew in popularity during the 1900s, however, the number of people educated at home using a planned curriculum dropped. In the last 20 years, in contrast, the number of children being formally educated at home has grown tremendously, in particular in the United States. The laws relevant to home education differ throughout the country. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the federal government, about 1.1 million children were home educated in 2003.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/nhes/homeschool/|title=1.1 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2003|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''District of Choice'''

District of Choice is a program in California created during 1993, allowing any California public school district to enroll students outside district lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ab_19_cfa_930614_094114_asm_floor|title=Assembly Third Reading-AB19|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Chuck|website=Official California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Assembly|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To participate in the program, district governing boards only need to declare themselves a District of Choice and set a quota for how many transfer students to accept to participate in the program. School districts cannot discriminate among students to enroll, but can limit them through an unbiased lottery system. The program was created in response to several parent's concerns over the lack of choice of schools to enroll their children in. Currently 47 school districts and 10,000 students participate in the program, serving 5 percent of school districts and 0.2 percent of students in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3331|title=Evaluation of the School District of Choice Program|last=|first=|date=January 27, 2016|website=Legislative Analyst's Office|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education Savings Accounts ===
This variant of school choice allows the parent to withdraw their child out of the public or charter school, and receive a direct deposit of public funds into a government-authorized savings account. These funds are often distributed in the form of a debit card that can be used to pay for various services, such as private school tuition and fees, online programs, private tutoring, community college costs, higher education services, and other approved learning materials and services. ESA‚Äôs also acquire the ability to pay for a combination of public school courses and private services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/education-savings-account/|title=What is an Education Savings Account? - EdChoice|work=EdChoice|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax credit/deduction for educational expenses ===
Certain states allow parents to claim a tax credit or deduction as a means to provide relief for certain educational expenses. These can include private school tuition, textbooks, school supplies and equipment, tutoring, and transportation. Currently, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have such programs.&lt;ref&gt;The ABC's of School Choice, 2014 Ed., Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual Tax Credit and Deduction Option ===

*This form of choice abates the income tax for parents, so approved educational expenses are economical. Approved educational expenses include private school tuition, supplies, computers, books, tutors, and transportation.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tax credits: lowers the total a person owes on taxes

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Tax deduction: reduces a persons total taxable income

=== Online Learning ===
Online learning permits students to work with teachers and their courses over the internet. This can be used in cooperation with, or in place of traditional classroom instruction. The online learning can be also paid for by accessing ESA‚Äôs and vouchers.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Customized Learning ===
This form of tutelage is a student-tailored form of education. This form of instruction can have various combinations. For example, course choice programs, public school courses, and special education therapies can all be integrated into a students curriculum. There are a myriad of possibilities, especially as learning innovations continue to occur.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== Debate ==

=== Support ===
The goal of school choice programs is to give parents more control over their child's education and to allow parents to pursue the most appropriate learning environments for children. For example, school choice may enable parents to choose a school that provides religious instruction, stronger discipline, better foundational skills (including reading, writing, mathematics, and science), everyday skills (from handling money to farming), or other desirable foci.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Scott|author2=Janice Aurini |title=Exploring School Choice in Canada: Who Chooses What and Why|journal=Canadian Public Policy|date=Dec 2011|volume=37|issue=4|pages=459‚Äì477|doi=10.1353/cpp.2011.0047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gulosino&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulosino|first=Charisse|author2=Christopher Lubienski |title=School's strategic responses to competition in segregated urban areas: Patterns in school locations in Metropolitan Detroit|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|date=May 2011|volume=19|issue=13|pages=1‚Äì29|url=http://www.redalyc.org/src/inicio/ArtPdfRed.jsp?iCve=275019735013|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of voucher models of school choice argue that choice creates competition between schools for students. Schools that fail to attract students can be closed. Advocates of school choice argue that this competition for students (and the dollars that come with them) create a catalyst for schools to create innovative programs, become more responsive to parental demands, and to increase student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lubienski|first=Christopher|author2=Jack Dougherty |title=Mapping Educational Opportunity: Spatial Analysis and School Choices|journal=American Journal of Education|date=August 2009|volume=115|issue=4|pages=485‚Äì491|doi=10.1086/599783}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline Hoxby]] suggests that this competition increases the productivity of a school. Hoxby describes a productive school as being one that produces high student achievement for each dollar spent.&lt;ref name=Hoxby&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoxby|first=Caroline M.|title=School Choice and School Productivity Could School Choice Be a Tide that Lifts All Boats?|journal=The Economics of School Choice|year=2003|pages=287‚Äì342|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c10091|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that this competition gives parents more power to influence their child's school in the school marketplace. Parents and students become the consumers and schools must work to attract new students with new programs. Parents also have the ability to punish schools that they judge to be inferior by leaving the 'bad' school for a better, more highly ranked school.&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, Claude and Andre Brassard.  "Education Governance in Canada, 1990-2003: Trends and Significance" ''Canadian Perspectives on the Sociology of Education''. Ed. Cynthia 	Levine-Rasky. Don Wells: Oxford University Press, 2009. 255-274.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents look for schools that will advocate for the needs of their child and if the school does not meet the needs required for that child, parents have the choice to find a school that will be more suitable.&lt;ref name=Bosetti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bosetti|first=Lynn|title=Determinants of School Choice: Understanding How Parents Choose Elementary Schools in Alberta|journal=Journal of Education Policy|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=4|pages=387‚Äì405|doi=10.1080/0268093042000227465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This freedom to choose puts the consequences of good or bad choosing on the parents instead of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosetti|first=Lynn|year=2005|title=Public Education at a Crossroad|url=|journal=American Journal of Education|volume=11|pages=435‚Äì441|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument in favor of school choice is based on cost-effectiveness. Studies undertaken by the [[Cato Institute]] and other [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[conservative]] [[think tank]]s conclude that privately run education both costs less and produces superior outcomes compared to public education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/new/09-03/09-02-03r.html |title=$5000 School Vouchers Would Give Most Students Access to Quality Private Schools |date=2003-09-02 |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814125444/http://www.cato.org/new/09-03/09-02-03r.html |archive-date=2008-08-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa486.pdf |format=PDF|title=What Does a Voucher Buy? |date=2003-08-28 |last=Salisbury |first=David |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arizona&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=16478 |title=Arizona Private Schools Half as Expensive as Public Schools |last=Murray |first=Vicki |publisher=The Heartland Institute |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapolicy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Centers/education/policynote/04_milewski_publiceducation.html |title=K-12 Public Education Spending in Washington |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=Washington Policy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821125957/http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/Centers/education/policynote/04_milewski_publiceducation.html |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that since children from impoverished families almost exclusively attend D or F ranked public schools, school choice programs would give parents the power to opt their children out of poorly-performing schools assigned by zip code and seek better education elsewhere. Supporters say this would level the playing field by broadening opportunities for low-income students‚Äîparticularly minorities‚Äîto attend high-quality schools that would otherwise be accessible only to higher-income families.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040829-114519-1566r.htm|title=12 million languish in failing public schools, report says|date=2004-08-29|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organisation Internationale pour le Droit √† l'Education et la Libert√© d'Enseignement (OIDEL), an international [[non-profit organization]] for the development of [[freedom of education]], maintains that the [[right to education]] is a fundamental [[human right]] which cannot exist without the presence of State benefits and the protection of individual liberties. According to the organization, freedom of education notably implies the freedom for parents to choose a school for their children without discrimination on the basis of finances. To advance freedom of education, OIDEL promotes a greater parity between public and private schooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OIDEL - A Presentation|url=http://www.oidel.ch/anglais/presentation/prospectus%20OIDEL%20anglais.pdf|publisher=Organisation Internationale pour le Droit √† l'Education et la Libert√© d'Enseignement|pages=1‚Äì2|format=Portable Document Format|accessdate=2009-04-18 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Teachers' unions in the United States are very opposed to school choice.

Public school entities are chiefly concerned that these school choice measures are taking funding away from public schools and therefore depleting their already strained resources. Other opponents of certain school choice policies (particularly vouchers) have cited the [[Establishment Clause]] and individual state [[Blaine Amendment|Blaine amendments]], which forbid, to one degree or another, the use of direct government aid to religiously affiliated entities. This is of particular concern in the voucher debate because voucher dollars are often spent at [[parochial school]]s.

Some school choice measures are criticized by public school entities, organizations opposed to church-state entanglement, and self-identified liberal advocacy groups. Known plaintiffs who have filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of state sponsored school choice laws are as follows: School Boards Associations, Public School Districts, Federations for Teachers, Associations of School Business Officials, Education Associations/Associations of Educators (unions for public school teachers), the American Civil Liberties Union, Freedom From Religion Foundation, and People for the American Way.&lt;ref&gt;The ABC's of School Choice, 2014 Ed., The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that school choice programs reduce housing prices, and that they do so in high-performing districts more than in low-performing districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=Il Hwan|title=School choice, housing prices, and residential sorting: Empirical evidence from inter-and intra-district choice|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|date=May 2015|volume=52|pages=39‚Äì49|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2015.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregation in school choice models ===
School choice systems afford families the opportunity to choose where to enroll their child among all available schools in a district.  The policy is an alternative to neighborhood schools, which often assign low-income families to lower-performing schools and high-income families to higher performing, better-funded schools.  In theory, school choice should lead to less segregation by race and class than neighborhood school policies by allowing families to select schools outside their neighborhoods.  However, a closer look at the reality of school choice presents several ways in which the policy does not provide equal opportunities to all students.  A longitudinal interview study showed that families of lower socioeconomic status considered and eventually chose lower-performing schools than their higher-income peers.  Low-income families lacked the social networks and access to information to learn which schools were higher-performing, and sometimes a family's own history with school achievement affected their choice for their child.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, C. A. (2009). All Choices Created Equal? The Role of Choice Sets in the Selection of Schools. Peabody Journal of Education, 84(2), 191‚Äì208. http://doi.org/10.1080/01619560902810146&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of the current school choice models do not offer transportation to out-of-neighborhood schools, which discourages low-income families from selecting schools outside their neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Betts, J. R., Rice, L. A., Zau, A. C., Tang, Y. E., &amp; Koedel, C. R. (2006). Does School Choice Work? Effects on Student Integration and Achievement. Public Policy Institute of California. http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/R_806JBR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies continue to support that choice schools are a contributing factor to racial segregation. A study conducted in 2006 examined the 22 largest school districts in the United States and findings suggested that there is more racial segregation in school districts with choice schools because public schools had less white students. It is important to note that there was a greater racial segregation between white and Hispanic students. This study found that there would be less segregation if students attended their school based on district boundaries &lt;ref&gt;Saporito, S., &amp; Sohoni, D. (2006). Coloring outside the lines: racial segregation in public schools and their attendance boundaries. ''Sociology of Education'', 79, 81-105.&lt;/ref&gt;. Magnet schools had a goal to help desegregate schools, but studies continue to highlight that school choice tends to be racially-based. For example, white parents were least likely to enroll their students in a school with a large population of African Americans &lt;ref&gt;Saporito, S. (2003). Private choices, public consequences: magnet school choice and segregation by race and poverty. ''Social Problems'', 50, 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;. This highlights the downfall of magnet schools being a choice school system to desegregate communities, because of the choices being made by parents. As more choice schools continue to replace public schools in the district, the problem of racial segregation is still prevalent if educational equity and opportunity remain a goal in the United States school system. 

For the California School District of Choice program, analysis from the California State Assembly demonstrates possible evidence that the program is excluding low-income students and increasing racial segregation. A report from the legislature lists several Districts of Choice accepting Black, Latino, and low-income students at lower percentages than the city or the student's original district demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly Third Reading-AB185. ''California Legislative Information''. California State Assembly. Retrieved from August 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature found that Latino students consist of 66 percent of students enrolling in original districts, while only 32 percent transfer to Districts of Choice. During the program's inception, a budget was provided for transportation, but the budget currently does not exist and some Districts of Choice do not pick up that extra cost. Critics argue that the lack of transportation creates a barrier for low income students to enter the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oakparktalon.org/4512/news/district-of-choice-bill-moves-through-state-legislature/|title=District of Choice bill moves through state legislature|last=Burt|first=Nick|work=Talon|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several school districts have sued Districts of Choice over concerns of accepting and excluding specific demographics.

Charter schools are another example of school choice. Parents can opt out of their traditional public school to attend a charter, regardless of school district.  Charters are significantly more segregated than their traditional public school counterparts.&lt;ref name="Frankenberg, E. 2011"&gt;Frankenberg, E., Siegel-hawley, G., &amp; Wang, J. (2011). Choice without equity: charter school segregation.  Education Policy Analysis Archives, 19(1), 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive study using three national data sources on schools in the United States examined the enrollment characteristics of charter schools as opposed to traditional public schools. The study found that Black students are over-enrolled in charters nationally, and the same is true for Latino students in metro areas.  In a majority of states, at least half of the Latino and Black students in charters are in intensely segregated minority schools (90‚Äì100% minority.)  Conversely, in diverse parts of the West and the South, charters serve racially isolated white populations.  Charters also enroll a higher percent of low-income students than public schools nationally.&lt;ref name="Frankenberg, E. 2011" /&gt;

The next question we must answer is why school choice systems and charter schools are more racially segregated.  One theory is that because choice systems allow parents to select their own school, any differing priorities between racial groups would cause some schools to be more appealing to black families, others to white families, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;Kleitz, B., Weiher, G. R., Tedin, K., &amp; Matland, R. (2000). Kleitz.pdf. Social Science Quarterly, 81(3), 846‚Äì854.&lt;/ref&gt;  While no racial differences in school preferences have been found through self-report, to truly examine parental motivations, we must also look at behaviors. This idea was examined in a group of parents who had switched their children out of the traditional public school and into a charter.  A survey was paired with an analysis of the characteristics of the school that each family left, and the characteristics of the charter school where the family then placed their child.  These results showed that regardless of stated preferences, parents chose to place their students in schools where they would have more classmates of their own race, even if this meant placing the child in a school with lower test scores.  This effect was the same across White, Black and Latino families.  However, this trend was seen only in choosing elementary and middle schools, not at the high school level.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, D. R. (2007). The Impact of School Choice on Racial Segregation in Charter Schools. Educational Policy, 22(6), 805‚Äì829. http://doi.org/10.1177/0895904807310043&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiher, G. R., &amp; Tedin, K. L. (2002). Does Choice Lead to Racially Distinctive Schools? Charter Schools and Household Preferences. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 21(1), 79‚Äì92. http://doi.org/10.1002/pam.1041&lt;/ref&gt;
Although it appears that parents are moving to more racially segregated schools, these choices are not necessarily motivated by race.   Instead, parents may be influenced by the location of the school.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Jacobs, N. (2013). Understanding School Choice: Location as a Determinant of Charter School Racial, Economic, and Linguistic Segregation. Education and Urban Society, 45(4), 459‚Äì482. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124511413388&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar study, the proximity of the school to the family's home was found to be a significant predictor of school choice.  The author suggests, then, that the segregation found in charter schools is not due to a parental bias towards racially homogeneous schools.  Instead, segregation in school choice programs is a reflection of the deeply segregated neighborhoods in our country, and the fact that parents want their child's school to be close to home.&lt;ref name="doi.org" /&gt; Another study was conducted in Washington D.C. with 11,000 students in reference to the proximity theory of school choice. This study supported parents‚Äô choice for schools based on school proximity, which is contrary to the belief that they choose schools based on academic scores. When parents choose schools based on what school is closest to them, it fosters racial segregation through economic means due to surrounding schools in a wealthy neighborhood versus people residing in a low- income neighborhood &lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, N. (2011). Understanding school choice: location as a determinant of charter school racial, economic, and linguistic segregation. ''Education and Urban Society'', 45, 459-482. 

doi: 10.1177/0013124511413388¬† ¬† &lt;/ref&gt;. This racial segregation stems from a systems level as to why more choice schools are being placed in neighborhoods with higher SES (socioeconomic status) and the determinants for these specific choice school placements.

Finally, it is important to consider the ramifications of a system that is significantly more racially segregated than traditional public schools. In an ethnographic study of three California charters serving populations segregated by race and class, the majority Black and Latino schools suffered from fewer financial resources.  These schools received less financial support from families, and had to fund services for their students that families from the majority white school paid for on their own, such as school supplies or emotional counseling. Additionally, teachers in the lower-income, minority segregated schools had less training and fewer resources.  One result of this was that frustrated teachers were more likely to attribute difficulties to negative student characteristics and the values of the child's family.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, K. (2008). To Have and to Have Not: The Socioeconomics of Charter Schools. Education and Urban Society, 41(2), 248‚Äì279. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124508325674&lt;/ref&gt; Black and Latino students have also been shown to have significantly lower achievement gains on standardized testing when in schools with high minority populations, based on a correlational study using No Child Left Behind data.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, D. N. (2006). Lost Learning, Forgotten Promises: A National Analysis of School Racial Segregation, Student Achievement, and Controlled Choice Plans.&lt;/ref&gt;
The broad effect of school choice and charter schools is to increase race and class segregation in schools.  This isolation creates environments in schools that do not reflect the make-up of the United States, and prevent students from being exposed to peers of different races or cultures.  More research is needed to examine how racially and economically segregated schools affect students' attitudes towards other races and classes. It is also important to remember that even some schools with diverse populations do not function as such: many highly "integrated" schools are in fact heavily tracked, with disproportionately fewer students of color in advanced tracks.  The real work ahead is to devise a system to functionally integrate schools so that students of all races and classes have access to equally successful schools, advanced courses, and preparation for higher education.

==International overview and major institutional options==

=== Finland ===
{{main|Education in Finland}}

The basic compulsory [[education|educational system]] in [[Finland]] is the nine-year [[comprehensive school]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''peruskoulu'', [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] ''grundskola'', "basic school"), for which school attendance is mandatory ([[homeschooling#Finland|homeschooling]] is allowed, but extremely rare). There are no so-called "gifted" programs. The more able children are expected to help those who are slower to catch on.

=== France ===
{{Main|Education in France}}
The [[France|French]] government subsidizes most private primary and secondary schools, including those affiliated with religious denominations, under contracts stipulating that education must follow the same curriculum as public schools and that schools cannot discriminate on grounds of religion or force pupils to attend religion classes.

This system of ''√©cole libre'' (Free Schooling) is mostly used not for religious reasons, but for practical reasons (private schools may offer more services, such as after-class tutoring) as well as the desire of parents living in disenfranchised areas to send their children away from the local schools, where they perceive that the youth are too prone to delinquency or have too many difficulties keeping up with schooling requirements that the educational content is bound to suffer. The threatened repealing of that status in the 1980s triggered mass street demonstrations in favor of the status. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Sweden ===
{{Main|Education in Sweden}}
Sweden reformed its school system in 1992.&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Free to choose, and learn | publisher = The Economist | date = 2007-05-03 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9119786 | accessdate = 2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its system of school choice is one of the freest in the world, allowing students to use public funds for the publicly or privately run school of their choice, including religious and for-profit schools.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt; Fifteen years after the reform, private school enrollment had increased from 1% to 10% of the student population.&lt;ref name="The Economist"/&gt;

=== Chile ===
{{Main|Education in Chile}}
In [[Chile]], there is an extensive voucher system in which the state pays private and municipal schools directly, based on average attendance (90% of the country students utilize such a system). The result has been a steady increase in the number and recruitment of private schools that show consistently better results in [[standardized test]]ing than municipal schools. The reduction of students in municipal schools has gone from 78% of all students in 1981, to 57% in 1990, and to less than 50% in 2005.

Regarding vouchers in Chile, researchers have found that when controls for the student's background (parental income and education) are introduced, the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McEwan|first=Patrick J.|author2=Martin Carnoy |date=Fall 2000|title=The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Private Schools in Chile's Voucher System|journal=Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis|volume=22|issue=3|pages=213‚Äì239|doi=10.3102/01623737022003213}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also greater variation within each subsector than between the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mizala|first=Alejandra |author2=Pilar Romaguera |title=Determinaci√≥n de Factores Explicativos de los Resultados Escolares en Educaci√≥n Media en Chile|publisher=Centre for Applied Economics, Department of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Chile|date=August 2000|series=Economy Series No. 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

A variety of forms of school choice exist in the United States. It is a highly debatable subject because some people wish to use taxpayer dollars in order to allow low-income students the choice of a private schools by way of vouchers. Research has shown that the students who transfer do worse in math and reading than their public school counterparts; not until an average of four years in the voucher program do the transfer students show to be performing equal to their counterparts in the public education system.

====Scholarship tax credits====
Scholarship tax credit programs currently exist in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia.&lt;ref name="School Choice Programs"/&gt;

Arizona has a well-known and fast-growing tax credit program. In the Arizona Individual Private School Tuition Tax Credit Program, in accordance with A.R.S. ¬ß43-1089&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/43/01089.htm&amp;Title=43&amp;DocType=ARS|title=Format Document|website=www.azleg.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ¬ß1089.03,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/43/01089-03.htm&amp;Title=43&amp;DocType=ARS|title=Format Document|website=www.azleg.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals can claim up to $1,053 and couples filing joint returns can claim up to $2106 (for 2014, amounts are indexed annually).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/SchoolTaxCreditsforIndividuals.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 24,000 children received scholarships in the 2011-2012 school year. Since the program has started in 1998, over 77,500 taxpayers have participated in the program, providing over $500 million in scholarship money for children at private schools across the state.&lt;ref&gt;Private School Tuition Organization Income Tax Credits In Arizona: A Summary of Activity FY 2013. Arizona Department of Revenue, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arizona program was challenged in court in ''[[Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn|ACSTO v Winn]]'' by a group of state taxpayers on the grounds that the tax credit violated the First Amendment because the tuition grants could go to students who attend private schools with religious affiliations.&lt;ref name=scotus&gt;Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn et al. 987 U.S. 9 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was initially brought against the state until the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization (ACSTO), one of the largest School Tuition Organizations in the state, voluntarily stepped in to represent the defense with the help of the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]] (formerly Alliance Defense Fund).  Typically, taxpayers are not allowed to bring suit against the government regarding how taxes are spent because injury would be purely speculative. In addition, insomuch as a donation to a School Tuition Organization is still a charitable act, just like any donation to a charity, there would be no standing unless all charitable deduction programs nationwide were brought under scrutiny. The Court ruled 5-4 to let the tax credit program stand.&lt;ref name=scotus/&gt; In April 2011, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found that a majority of American voters (60%) felt that the tax credits support school choice for parents whereas 26% felt as it the tax credits support religion.&lt;ref name=FDU&gt;[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] PublicMind Poll [http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2011/taxcredits/ "Public Blesses Arizona Christian School Tuition"] press release (April 4, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iowa, the Educational Opportunities Act was signed into law in 2006, creating a pool of tax credits for eligible donors to student tuition organizations (STOs).  At first, these tax caps were $5 million but in 2007, Governor [[Chet Culver]] increased the total amount to $7.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/iac/rule/11-26-2014.701.42.32.pdf|title=School tuition organization tax credit|last=|first=|date=|website=iowa.gov|publisher=Iowa Department of Revenue|access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iowa Alliance for Choice in Education]] (Iowa ACE) oversees the STOs and advocates for school choice in Iowa.

Greater Opportunities for Access to Learning (GOAL) is the Georgia program which offers a state income tax credit to donors of scholarships to private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://romenews-tribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-%20&amp;id=4152577-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-&amp;instance=home_news|title=GOAL to aid private schools, donors: Saturday is the deadline for a tax break to benefit schools and their contributors.|last=Bell|first=Daniel|date=October 27, 2009|work=Rome News-Tribune|accessdate=2009-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715201729/http://romenews-tribune.com/pages/full_story/push?article-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-%20&amp;id=4152577-GOAL+to+aid+private+schools-+donors-++Saturday+is+the+deadline+for+a+tax+break+to+benefit+schools+and+their+contributors-&amp;instance=home_news|archive-date=2011-07-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Greg, [https://www.npr.org/2012/08/15/158691518/tax-credit-scholarships-reignite-voucher-debate "Tax Credit Scholarships Reignite Voucher Debate"], [[NPR]] ''All Things Considered'', August 15, 2012.

====Vouchers====

Vouchers currently exist in Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, Indiana and, most recently, the District of Columbia&lt;ref name=heritage2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/bg1848.cfm|title=Choices in Education: 2005 Progress Report|last=Kafer|first=Krista|date=2005-04-25|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907094551/http://heritage.org/Research/Education/bg1848.cfm|archive-date=2008-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georgia.

The largest and oldest Voucher program is in Milwaukee. Started in 1990, and expanded in 1995, it currently allows no more than 15% of the district's public school enrollment to use vouchers. As of 2005 over 14,000 students use vouchers and they are nearing the 15% cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/SchoolChoice/Wisconsin.cfm|title=School Choice - Wisconsin|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919004716/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Education/SchoolChoice/Wisconsin.cfm|archive-date=2008-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School vouchers are legally controversial in some states. In 2014 a lawsuit sought to challenge the legality of the Florida voucher program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-school-voucher-lawsuit-20140828-story.html|title=Lawsuit calls Florida voucher program unconstitutional|first=Leslie|last=Postal|website=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the legal and moral precedents for vouchers may have been set by the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. bill]], which includes a voucher program for university-level education of veterans.{{synthesis|date=January 2015}} The G.I. bill permits veterans to take their educational benefits at religious schools, an extremely divisive issue when applied to primary and secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', 536 U.S. 639 (2002), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that school vouchers could be used to pay for education in sectarian schools without violating the Establishment Clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. As a result, states are basically free to enact voucher programs that provide funding for any school of the parent's choosing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The Supreme Court has not decided, however, whether states can provide vouchers for secular schools only, excluding sectarian schools. Proponents of funding for parochial schools argue that such an exclusion would violate the free exercise clause. However, in ''[[Locke v. Davey]]'', 540 U.S. 712 (2004), the Court held that states could exclude majors in "devotional theology" from an otherwise generally available college scholarship. The Court has not indicated, however, whether this holding extends to the public school context, and it may well be limited to the context of individuals training to enter the ministry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

====Charter schools====
The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, City Academy, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Dayton, Ohio has between 22‚Äì26% of all children in charter schools.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; This is the highest percentage in the nation. Other hotbeds for charter schools are Kansas City (24%), Washington, D.C. (20-24%) and the State of Arizona. Almost 1 in 4 public schools in Arizona are charter schools, comprising about 8% of total enrollment.

Charter schools can also come in the form of Cyber Charters. Cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building. And, like charter schools, they are public schools, but free of many of the rules and regulations that public schools must follow.

====Magnet schools====
{{main|Magnet school}}
Magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science, technology or art. These magnet schools, unlike charter schools, are not open to all children. Much like many private schools, the students must test into the school.

====Home schooling====
{{main|Homeschooling}}
The laws relevant to homeschooling differ between US states. In some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home. In other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state. Such laws are not always enforced however. According to the Federal Government, about 1.1 million children were Home Educated in 2003.&lt;ref name="nces.ed.gov"/&gt;

====College====
The United States has school choice at the university level. College students can get subsidized tuition by attending ''any'' public college or university within their state of residence. Furthermore, the U.S. federal government provides tuition assistance for both public and private colleges via the [[G.I. Bill]] and federally guaranteed [[student loans]].

'''Simply Music''' is a [[music education]] institution licensing teachers at over 700 locations in twelve countries. [[Australians|Australian]] music educator [[Neil Moore (musician)|Neil Moore]] founded it on the core belief that all humans are naturally musical. Simply Music offers programs for students from birth through old age, with the stated goal that "students acquire and retain music as a lifelong companion." Simply Music patterns its approach after primary language acquisition, where speaking comes first.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/about/|title=about Simply Music piano|last=|first=|date=|website=Simply Music|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this it shares some philosophical ground with other developmental approaches like [[Kod√°ly Method|Kod√°ly]], [[Orff-Schulwerk]], and the [[Suzuki Method]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Campbell, Patricia Shehan and Carol Scott-Kassner. ''Music in Childhood: From Preschool through the Elementary Grades''. New York: Schirmer, 1995. 47-57. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neil Moore began constructing the Simply Music method in the late 20th century while teaching [[piano]] to a young [[Blindness|blind]] student. Since traditional music-reading would not serve this student, Moore designed a program based on his own childhood musical experiences. Instead of reading music, as a child Moore had naturally visualized patterns within the songs and on the keyboard. He explained these building blocks to this student, who learned to play piano himself and began teaching the songs to his four-year-old sister, who was also blind.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This spurred Moore to begin testing his ideas more widely, and he found this approach natural and successful for students of all ages and abilities. Other piano teachers began learning from Moore. When he could no longer personally train them all, Moore founded the Simply Music organization and developed a remote [[certification]] program that is currently available to teachers in twelve countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Bernadette E. "Coming Home: The Story of One Man." ''A World Where Everyone Plays''. Ed. Bernadette E. Ashby. Sunnyvale, CA: Efting Press, 2011. 1-7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Simply Music expanded to include [[early childhood music education]], and also worked with Karen Nisenson to create [http://simplymusicgateway.com/ Simply Music Gateway], an adaptive piano curriculum for children with [[special needs]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Philosophy ==
Simply Music's founding premise is similar to [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shin'ichi Suzuki]]‚Äôs claim that any child can learn [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Shinichi. ''Nurtured by Love: The Classic Approach to Talent Education''. Miami: Warner Bros. Publications Inc., 1999. 1-3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; But Simply Music extends the concept, like researchers [http://www.conservatorium.unimelb.edu.au/staff/garymcphersonary E. McPherson Gary E. McPherson] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20130908161959/http://www.imerc.org/people.php Graham F. Welch], who write that it is our "birthright" to "be able to communicate and interact musically with others."&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Graham F. and Gary E. McPherson. "Introduction and Commentary: The Role of Music in People‚Äôs Lives." ''The Oxford Handbook of Music Education, vol. I''. Ed. Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch. New York: Oxford University Press, 2012. 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same degree, Simply Music declares musicality essential to human nature. Adherents identify many everyday activities as fundamentally musical because these activities thoughtlessly fall into patterns of [[rhythm]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. As examples they cite speaking, walking, and brushing teeth. Simply Music seeks both to draw on and to nurture this natural ability by distilling musical concepts into simple patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_StudentBrochure_2016-17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Students use these patterns to begin playing songs in their first lessons. This method is modeled after primary [[language acquisition]], where learners begin by speaking. Many other music education approaches‚Äîincluding [[Orff Schulwerk]] and the [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|Dalcroze]], [[Kod√°ly Method|Kod√°ly]], and [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] methods‚Äîengage students physically first and teach [[Musical notation|notation]] later.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The complete Simply Music program aims to teach music for generalists, who may or may not later choose a specialty such as performing [[classical music]], playing [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] in a band, or [[Accompaniment|accompanying]] [[Soloist (music)|soloists]] or theater performers. The program attempts to prepare students with a solid music background that can take them where they choose. The primary goal is for students to keep music in their life, most often for [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] and enjoyment at home or with family and friends. As such, Simply Music includes a wide variety of musical [[genres]], such as [[Classical music|classical]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[Popular music|popular]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Simply Music does not focus on mastering classical [[concert]] performance [[Musical technique|technique]]. Instead, Simply Music teachers encourage students to play [[Musical expression|expressively]] and comfortably, without tension.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_TeacherBrochure_2016-17.pdf|title=Teaching Simply Music pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==

The Simply Music approach contrasts with many other music learning methods, where the ability to play music depends first on learning to read music. Moore terms these traditional methods ''reading-based ''and his approach ''playing-based''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/SMP_StudentBrochure_2016-17.pdf|title=Simply Music student brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core playing-based piano pieces are presented in the Foundation Program, a series of 9 levels of 7-10 songs each. The pieces are designed to provide experience with many musical styles and genres, to build students‚Äô physical dexterity at the piano, and to give students hands-on familiarity with fundamental musical concepts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Alongside the Foundation Program, and often using concepts from the Foundation pieces, students learn [[Arrangement (music)|arrangement]], [[Improvisation (music)|improvisation]], [[Composition (music)|composition]], [[Chord (music)|chord]]-reading, and [[Music theory|theory]]. Teachers are required to present all these programs, as they are considered essential to a well-rounded music education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Simply Music maintains that their approach‚Äîbased on learning to recognize patterns inherent in music‚Äîis distinct from learning by rote or by ear. Students learn through patterns on the keyboard, in their fingers, and in the music itself. Students learn the physical shape that a melody line or a chord forms in the hand or on the keyboard. For example, a basic [[Triad (music)|triad]] such as [[D major|D Major]] is seen as a triangle shape on the keyboard, with the two white notes forming the base and the black note at the top. Musical patterns include concepts like [[Ostinato|repeated rhythmic]] or [[melodic pattern]]s (or [[Sequence (music)|sequences]]), melodic sentences, [[musical forms]] such as ABA, and chord progressions like the [[12-bar blues]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Experience with these concepts provides a foundation for learning note-reading during the second year. Simply Music first teaches rhythm notation, followed by pitch reading, and then applies these skills to pieces written in standard music notation. Students learn to read pitches by identifying intervals, rather than individual note-names. This is known as an ''intervallic ''approach.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Simply Music also uses what they call ''[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/generative generative] ''learning, meaning that students write music as an integral part of learning to read music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As students further expand their musicianship, they move into the Development Program, which applies their musical understanding and note-reading skills to increasingly complex written music. Lessons continue to include arrangement, improvisation, composition, chord-reading, and theory. At this phase, students also explore their own musical interests in more depth.

Simply Music piano may be taught in either shared or private lessons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The early childhood program is taught in small groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Early childhood==

Simply Music partners with an affiliate young childhood music education program, Lynn Kleiner's [https://musicrhapsody.com/ Music Rhapsody].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Music Rhapsody is a music and movement program for infants through age five. Early childhood music education specialist [http://www.musicrhapsody.com/About-Lynn-Kleiner Lynn Kleiner] based the program on the [[Orff Schulwerk]] philosophy. In keeping with its roots, the program focuses on learning through play and addresses each stage of child development. The program immerses children in music-making through diverse songs, instruments, movement, puppets and visuals. By building a foundation in music and incorporating Simply Music repertoire, it prepares students to transition into the piano program.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;http://www.musicrhapsody.com/Why-Music-Rhapsody/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==

All the Simply Music programs use a variety of multimedia materials to provide [[multisensory learning]]. Simply Music Piano and Accordion students use written music as well as other written materials to remember assignments and track their progress. Video recordings distill the main points of every lesson. Audio recordings help students become familiar with the songs, refine style and technique, and develop ensemble skills. Teacher training is also presented through multimedia materials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Early childhood Music Rhapsody students use a wide variety of specially designed instruments along with movement materials, puppets, and visuals. The program also provides audio recordings for students and teachers, as well as video support for teachers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Repertoire==
The Simply Music Piano and Accordion repertoire covers a broad range of styles, including classical, contemporary, jazz, blues, gospel, and other styles from around the world. In addition to the core Foundation pieces, students learn arrangements of each piece, along with accompaniments, teacher-selected written pieces, student-choice songs, and student compositions.

A student‚Äôs personal repertoire is called their Playlist. A Playlist is considered essential, partly because a large and varied repertoire helps facilitate lifelong musical engagement. Also, each new piece builds on musical concepts from earlier pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Music Rhapsody curriculum centers around [[children‚Äôs music]], both traditional and contemporary, and also introduces many styles including classical, jazz, blues, and international music.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">A '''Wittgenstein's ladder''' is a simplified explanation of a technical or complex subject that is used as a teaching tool, despite being technically wrong.

The term stems from proposition number 6.54 in Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s 1921 philosophical work ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', in which he states that although his propositions are at some level incorrect, they can be used like steps on a ladder to help one reach an understanding of higher level concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/ |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Side-by-Side-by-Side Edition |publisher=People.umass.edu |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them‚Äîas steps‚Äîto climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.}}&lt;ref&gt;Original in [[German language|German]]:
{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Meine S√§tze erl√§utern dadurch, dass sie der, welcher mich versteht, am Ende als unsinnig erkennt, wenn er durch sie‚Äîauf ihnen‚Äî√ºber sie hinausgestiegen ist. (Er muss sozusagen die Leiter wegwerfen, nachdem er auf ihr hinaufgestiegen ist.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Er muss diese S√§tze √ºberwinden, dann sieht er die Welt richtig.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers before Wittgenstein including [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Fritz Mauthner]] had used a similar metaphor before him.&lt;ref name=gakis&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wittgensteinrepository.org/agora-alws/article/view/2891/3506|title=Throwing Away the Ladder Before Climbing it|last=Gakis|first=Dimitris|work=Papers of the 33rd IWS (eds. E. Nemeth, R. Heinrich, W. Pichler)|volume=|issue=|page=|date=2010|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Wittgenstein rejected his own "ladder" idea, stating:&lt;ref name=gakis/&gt;
{{quote|Anything that can be reached with a ladder does not interest me.}}

A '''zero-tolerance policy in schools''' is a strict enforcement of regulations and bans against undesirable behaviors or possession of items.  Public criticism against such policies have arisen due to their enforcement and the resulting (sometimes devastating) consequences when the behavior or possession was done in ignorance, by accident, or under [[extenuating circumstances]]. For example, a ban against guns resulting in a Rhode Island boy with a gun charm on a key chain being suspended. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit [[recreational drug use|drugs]] or [[weapon]]s.  Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always (if the policy is followed) to be punished.

In the United States and Canada, [[Zero tolerance|zero-tolerance]] policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues.  Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel any student who brought a firearm to school for one year, or lose all federal funding.&lt;ref name=Cauchon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/educate/ednews3.htm |title=Zero-tolerance policies lack flexibility |work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies are promoted as preventing [[drug abuse]] and [[violence in schools]]. Critics say zero tolerance in schools have resulted in punishments which have been criticised as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these  policies as '''zero-logic policies''' because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delawareliberal.net/2009/10/06/zero-tolerance-is-zero-intelligence/ |title=Zero Tolerance is Zero Intelligence |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=Delaware Liberal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äî or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero tolerance policies, claiming that they are overly draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the [[criminal justice system]], and/or disproportionately target blacks and Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/19/zero-tolerance-school.html |title=LA schools to end zero-tolerance policies and criminalization of students |work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There is no credible evidence that zero tolerance reduces violence or drug abuse by students.&lt;ref name=skiba2000/&gt;  Furthermore, school [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] and [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]] result in a number of negative outcomes for both schools and students.&lt;ref name="skiba2000"&gt;Russell J. Skiba [https://web.archive.org/web/20140824031650/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Esafeschl/ztze.pdf Zero Tolerance, Zero Evidence: An Analysis of School Disciplinary Practice] Policy Research Report #SRS2 August, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Bar Association]] finds that the evidence indicates that minority children are the most likely to suffer the negative consequences of zero tolerance policies. Analysis of the suspension rate of students show that black females and other racial minorities are suspended at a greater rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/projects/center-for-civil-rights-remedies/school-to-prison-folder/federal-reports/are-we-closing-the-school-discipline-gap/AreWeClosingTheSchoolDisciplineGap_FINAL221.pdf |title=ARE WE CLOSING THE SCHOOL DISCIPLINE GAP? |work=UCLA C E N T E R F O R C I V I L R I G H T S R E M E D I E S |date=Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] concluded that the available evidence does not support the use of zero tolerance policies as defined and implemented, that there is a clear need to modify such policies, and that the policies create a number of unintended negative consequences,&lt;ref&gt;Are Zero Tolerance Policies Effective in the Schools? An evidentiary review and recommendations. [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/63/9/ ''American Psychologist,'' December 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://everydaypsychology.com/2009/03/zero-tolerance-policies-no-substitute.html Zero Tolerance Policies: no substitute for good judgment] Summary of the APA Task Force Report at everydaypsychology.com&lt;/ref&gt; including making schools "less safe".&lt;ref name=Nuckols /&gt;

In 2014, a study of [[school discipline]] figures was conducted. It was found that suspensions and expulsions as a result of zero tolerance policies have not reduced school disruptions. The study's author stated that "zero tolerance approaches to school discipline are not the best way to create a safe climate for learning".&lt;ref name=skiba2014&gt;Skiba, R. J. (2014). [https://reclaimingjournal.com/sites/default/files/journal-article-pdfs/22_4_Skiba.pdf The Failure of Zero Tolerance.

Roberge |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this seems like a simple action-reaction type of situation, it often leaves out the mitigating circumstances that are often the important details in student incidents. Even civilian judges consider mitigating circumstances before passing judgement or sentencing. If zero tolerance policies were applied in adult courtroom scenarios, they would be fundamentally unjust and unconstitutional due to neglecting the laws involving due process, along with cruel and unusual punishments.

==History==
The label of zero tolerance began with the [[Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994]], when Congress authorized public-school funding subject to the adoption of zero-tolerance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Pace Law Review |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=1999 |title=The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994: Zero Tolerance Takes Aim at Procedural Due Process |author=Kathleen M. Cerrone |url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=plr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar policies of intolerance coupled with expulsions for less serious behaviors than bringing a weapon to school had long been a part of private, and particularly religious, schools. The use of zero-tolerance policies in secular, public schools increased dramatically after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], with principals declaring that safety concerns made them want zero tolerance for weapons. These have led to a large number of disproportionate responses to minor, or technical transgressions, many of which have attracted the attention of the international media. These cases include students being suspended or expelled for such offenses as possession of [[ibuprofen]] or [[Midol]] (both legal, non-prescription drugs commonly used to treat [[Dysmenorrhea|menstrual cramps]] and [[headache]]s) with permission of the students' parents, keeping [[pocket knife|pocketknives]] (small utility knife) in cars, and carrying sharp tools outside of a woodshop classroom (where they are often required materials). In Seal v. Morgan, a student was expelled for having a knife in his car on school property, despite his protestations that he was unaware of the knife's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henault|first1=Cherry|title=Zero Tolerance in Schools|journal=Journal of Law &amp; Education|date=2001|volume=30|issue=3|pages=547‚Äì53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, zero-tolerance policies have come into conflict with freedom of religion rules already in place allowing students to carry, for example, [[kirpan]]s.

In the [[kids for cash scandal|"kids for cash" scandal]], judge [[Mark Ciavarella]], who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a [[Principal (academia)|principal]] on [[Myspace]], scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting [[DVD]]s from [[Wal-Mart]]. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offenses are normalized. The documentary ''Kids for Cash'' interviews experts on adolescent behavior, who argue that the zero tolerance model has become a dominant approach to policing juvenile offenses after the Columbine shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jjie.org/a-plot-with-a-scandal-a-close-look-at-the-kids-for-cash-documentary/ |title=A Plot with a Scandal: A Closer Look at ‚ÄòKids for Cash‚Äô Documentary |first=Daryl|last=Khan |date=10 February 2014 |work=Juvenile Justice Information Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaparadiso.co.uk/blog/film-reviews/kids-for-cash-review/ |title=Kids for Cash Review |first=Mark|last=McPherson |date=20 March 2015 |work=Cinema Paradiso Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
Proponents of punishment- and exclusion-based philosophy of school discipline policies claim that such policies are required to create an appropriate environment for learning.&lt;ref name=skiba2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Noguera1995&gt;Noguera, Pedro A. [http://youthjusticenc.org/download/education-justice/prevention-intervention-alternatives/Preventing%20and%20Producing%20Violence:%20A%20Critical%20Analysis%20of%20Responses%20to%20School%20Violence.pdf Preventing and Producing Violence: A Critical Analysis of Responses to School Violence] ''Harvard Educational Review'', Summer 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;189‚Äì212.&lt;/ref&gt; This rests on the assumption that strong
enforcement can act as a [[Deterrence (psychology)|psychological deterrent]] to other potentially disruptive students.&lt;ref name=skiba2014/&gt;

The policy assumption is that inflexibility is a deterrent because, no matter how or why the rule was broken, the fact that the rule was broken is the basis for the imposition of the penalty. This is intended as a [[behavior modification]] strategy:  since those at risk know that it may operate unfairly, they may be induced to take even unreasonable steps to avoid breaking the rule. This is a standard policy in rule- and law-based systems around the world on "offenses" as minor as traffic violations to major health and safety legislation for the protection of employees and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi, Patti. "Zero tolerance for zero tolerance" ''Atlanta Constitution'', March 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplinarian parents view zero-tolerance policies as a tool to fight corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Takyi-Boadu, Charles. "On Zero-Tolerance Corruption not Province of Politicians." ''The Ghanaian Chronicle'', March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this argument, if subjective judgment is not allowed, most attempts by the authority person to encourage bribes or other favors in exchange for leniency are clearly visible.

==Criticism==
Critics of zero-tolerance policies in schools say they are part of a [[United States school-to-prison link|school-to-prison pipeline]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2014/june_2014/the_emergence_of_the_school-to-prison_pipeline.html|title=The Emergence of the School-to-Prison Pipeline - Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that over-polices children with behavioural problems, treating their problems as criminal justice issues rather than educational and behavioural problems. Students that may previously have been given short school suspensions before the implementation of policies are now sent to juvenile courts.&lt;ref name="ScottSteinberg2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth S Scott |author2=Laurence D Steinberg |title=Rethinking Juvenile Justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEkbMyBLJXIC |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04336-7 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of zero-tolerance policies frequently refer to cases where minor offenses have resulted in severe punishments. Typical examples include the honor-roll student being expelled from school under a "no weapons" policy while in possession of [[nail clipper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/juvjus/zerotolreport.html Final Report, Bi Partisan Working Group on Youth Violence] 106th Congress, February 1996 Zero Tolerance Policy Report, American Bar Association&lt;/ref&gt; or for possessing "drugs" like [[cough drop]]s and dental [[mouthwash]] or "weapons" like [[rubber band]]s.&lt;ref name=Cauchon/&gt;

A related criticism is that zero-tolerance policies make schools feel like a [[jail]] or a [[prison]].
Furthermore zero-tolerance policies have been struck down by U.S. courts&lt;ref&gt;"Pensacola honor students win zero tolerance drug ruling" article of the AP/Bradenton Herald, Sept. 8, 2002 at [http://www.overlawyered.com/archives/02/sept3.html#0930b Overlawyered.com archives Sept. 2002 pt. III]&lt;/ref&gt; and by departments of education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/youth/28109prs20070119.html Rhode Island Officials Rule School Can't Censor Teen's Yearbook Photo] (1/19/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the zero-tolerance policies have actually caused schools to [[turn a blind eye]] to bullying, resulting in them refusing to solve individual cases in an attempt to make their image look better. The zero-tolerance policy also punishes both the attacker and the defender in a fight, even when the attacker was the one who started the fight unprovoked.

A particularly dismaying hypothesis about zero tolerance policies is that they may actually discourage some people from reporting criminal and illegal behavior, for fear of losing relationships, and for many other reasons. That is, ironically, zero tolerance policies may be ineffective in the very purpose for which they were originally designed.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary and Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society, Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (editors), Cornell University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As schools develop responses to [[online bullying]], schools that have overly harsh approaches to zero tolerance policies may increasingly police speech of students in their own time, that would normally be protected by [[free speech]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/litigation/committees/childrights/content/articles/fall2012-0912-zero-tolerance-online-bullying-free-speech.html|title=Zero Tolerance for Online Bullying Can Hamper Free Speech - Children's Rights Litigation - ABA Section of Litigation|website=apps.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Bar Association]] opposes "zero tolerance policies that mandate either expulsion or referral of students to juvenile or criminal court, without regard to the circumstances or nature of the offense or the students{{sic}} history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/child_law/tools_to_use/attorneys/school_disciplinezerotolerancepolicies.html|title=School Discipline "Zero Tolerance" Policies - Center on Children and the Law|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of zero tolerance policies also argue that the large numbers of students who are suspended and expelled from school experience negative effects which can prohibit them from finishing high school. Students who experience suspension, expulsion and arrests pay higher psychological and social costs: such as depression, suicidal thoughts, academic failure, and run the risk of being incarcerated as adults. In a study by Forrest et. al., (2000), psychologists identified that a third of youths in juvenile detention centers were diagnosed with depression shortly after being incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scogin|first=Forrest|last2=Welsh|first2=Douglas|last3=Hanson|first3=Ashley|last4=Stump|first4=Jamie|last5=Coates|first5=Adriana|date=2005-09-01|title=Evidence-Based Psychotherapies for Depression in Older Adults|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi033/abstract|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=222‚Äì237|doi=10.1093/clipsy.bpi033|issn=1468-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being diagnosed with depression many youths found themselves having suicidal thoughts (Gnau et. al. 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mace D, Rohde P, Gnau V |date=1997|title=Psychological patterns of depression and suicidal behavior of adolescents in a juvenile detention facility.|url=|journal=Journal for Juvenile Justice and Detention Services.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research found that Black, Latino, and White adults with low educational attainment risked a higher propensity of being incarcerated in their lifetime (Pettit &amp; Western 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Western|first=Bruce|last2=Pettit|first2=Becky|title=Incarceration &amp; social inequality|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/DAED_a_00019|journal=Daedalus|volume=139|issue=3|pages=8‚Äì19|doi=10.1162/daed_a_00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study they found that the incarceration rate in 2008 rose to 37% since the 1980‚Äôs. This showed that incarceration rates of people with low levels of education were continuing to rise and that students were not completing their high school requirements.

According to kidsdata.org for the year 2012, 21,638 students were suspended and 592 students were expelled from San Diego County schools. A total of 10.1% of students did not complete their high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kidsdata.org|title=Kidsdata: Data and Resources about the Health of Children|website=Kidsdata.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a decrease in juvenile arrest, suspensions, expulsions, and drop out rates, many still argue that these disciplinary policies have helped contribute to students not completing their high school curriculum. Schools are struggling to keep students within the walls of the educational system rather than the walls of a juvenile detention center.

==Escondido school knives case==
The '''Escondido school knives case''' is a collection of school suspensions, possible expulsions, and protests surrounding knives that were found in the cars of two students at [[San Pasqual High School (Escondido, California)|San Pasqual High School]] in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[California]].

===Discovery and arrests=== 
Brandon Cappaletti, an 18-year-old student at the school, had been on a fishing trip in early January, 2016. He says he had used the knives to cut line and would have used them to prepare fish. After the fishing trip, he left the knives in his truck. Another 16-year-old student had a [[pocket knife]] in his [[glove compartment]].&lt;ref name=reason_zero&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/12/zero-tolerance-2-teens-face-expulsion-ja|title=Zero Tolerance: 2 Teens Face Expulsion, Jail for Fishing Knives, Advil in Their Cars|author=Soave, Robby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, police dogs were sniffing vehicles in the school's parking lot. Each student had [[Advil]] in the truck. In each case, the dogs alerted on the Advil. Cappaletti was called out of class to unlock the truck. The police found the Advil and the knives. In the case of the 16-year-old, the alert also which led to the police finding the pocket knife.&lt;ref name=reason_zero/&gt;

Both boys were [[arrested]]. Cappaletti was later released to his mother. The 16-year-old's case was referred to the California's [[diversion program|juvenile diversion program]]. Both boys have been charged with a [[misdemeanor]] for having a knife on school property with a blade longer than two-and-a-half [[inch]]es. Both were also immediately suspended from classes.&lt;ref name=reason_zero/&gt; A hearing on Feb. 25 will decide whether or not they will be expelled.

===Impact and protests===
Cappaletti has already joined the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines Corps]]. If convicted of the misdemeanor, he might not be able to remain. His mother Amy Cappelletti said that ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the most patriotic student. He never gets into trouble. These weren‚Äôt Crocodile Dundee knives.‚Äù&lt;ref name=uniontribune_zero_tolerance&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/feb/09/zero-tolerance-escondido-knife-expulsion/#sthash.GsHMyUcO.dpuf|title=Forgotten knives meet zero tolerance|author=Miao, Pat|work=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a School Board meeting on February 9, 2016, hundreds of people asked the Board not to expel the two students. Tony Coreley, the high school's [[Coach (American football)|football coach]] said that ‚ÄúThere are rules and laws that the district has to follow, but this (situation) is unfortunate.‚Äù&lt;ref name=uniontribune_zero_tolerance/&gt;

School District spokeswoman Karyl O‚ÄôBrien said that the situation was unfortunate, but under California's zero-tolerance policy, there were rules the school had to follow.

===Resolution===
On February 11, 2016, the [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] of the [[Escondido Union School District]] stated that the students would not be expelled, and that they were expected to be allowed to return to school the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Escondido-San-Pasqual-High-School-Student-Knives-Sam-Serrato-Brandon-Cappelletti-368639191.html|title=San Pasqual High School Students Found With Knives Will Not be Expelled|author=Garske, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 13, the misdemeanor charges remain unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/31208965/too-harsh-students-face-expulsion-and-misdemeanors|title=No expulsion, students still face misdemeanors|work=[[NBC San Diego]]|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
