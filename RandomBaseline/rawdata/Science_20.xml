'''Adductomics''' is the study of [[DNA adducts]] in the context of an entire [[genome]].  DNA adducts are [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that bind to [[DNA]], causing damage and [[mutations]].  These mutations can result in [[cancer]] and [[birth defects]] in [[multicellular organisms]].  The science of adductomics seeks to identify all DNA adducts and the target sequence of each adduct.

The term "adductome" first appeared in a journal article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;MATSUDA TOMONARI, ROBERT A. KANALY, HANAOKA TOMOYUKI, SUGIMURA HARUHIKO, TODA HIROKAZU, MATSUI SABURO.  2005.  "DNA adductome strategy for detection of multiple DNA adducts." Nippon Kankyo Hen'igen Gakkai Taikai Puroguramu, Yoshishu.  34:77&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally the term related to adducts of DNA, the adductomic approach has now been adopted by [[protein]] chemists in their attempts to identify [[protein adducts]].

'''''An Urchin in the Storm''''' is a 1987 essay collection from [[paleontology|paleontologist]] and science writer [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

==Overview==
All but one of the essays had originally appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Grouped by theme, the sections of the book deal respectively with the irreducibility of history (and the pleasures and challenges of contingency) in its two principal domains of life and the earth, nature's complexity, the theory and consequences of [[biological determinism]], and rationalism in explanation.  Thus it is philosophically the most important of Gould's works - as befits a book dedicated to Peter Medawar and especially Isaiah Berlin, since the latter shares with Gould a commitment against determinism, even though Gould had a Marxist background while Berlin is quintessentially anti-Marxist.

It was reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Michiko Kakutani]], who noted that although the pieces were technically book reviews, Gould "tends to use the subject at hand as a jumping-off point for more general discussions". Gould argued against [[Creationism]] and biological determinism, criticizing [[sociobiology]] and [[Arthur Jensen]]'s theories about race and intelligence. Other subjects discussed included the nature of geological time and change, the 19th century Devonian controversy, which involved the identification of a major period of earth history, and the work of biologists [[Barbara McClintock]], [[E. E. Just]], G. E. Hutchinson, and [[Lewis Thomas]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/home/gould-urchin.html | title=New York Times Review | accessdate=July 9, 2012 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aperiodic frequency''' is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of incidence or occurrence of non-[[Periodic function|cyclic]] phenomena, including random processes such as [[radioactive decay]]. It is expressed in [[units of measurement]] of [[reciprocal seconds]] (s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=3UGQsi6VamwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mechatronic Systems, Sensors, and Actuators: Fundamentals and Modeling|last=Lombardi|first=Michael A.|date=2017-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9781420009002|editor-last=Bishop|editor-first=Robert H.|location=Austin|pages=18-1|language=en|chapter=Fundamentals of Time and Frequency}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of radioactivity, [[becquerels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Units with special names and symbols; units that incorporate special names and symbols|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-2.html|journal=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI)|edition=8th|volume=Section 2.2.2|pages=|via=|Section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is defined as a [[ratio]], ''f'' = ''N''/''T'', involving the number of times an [[Event (philosophy)|event]] happened (''N'') during a given time [[Time|duration]] (''T''); it is a [[physical quantity]] of type [[temporal rate]].

The '''Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences''', abbreviated '''BITSS''', is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing [[transparency]] and openness in [[social science]] research. It was established in 2012 by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Center for Effective Global Action]]. It is led by an interdisciplinary group of academics from ten different universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bitss.org/about/ |title=About |date=2015-10-08 |website=Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked with the [[Center for Open Science]] to define and promote a set of best practices for social scientists to maximize transparency in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miguel |first=E. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. |last3=Casey |first3=K. |last4=Cohen |first4=J. |last5=Esterling |first5=K.

The '''crackpot index''' is a number that rates scientific claims or the individuals that make them, in conjunction with a method for computing that number. While the indices have been created for their humorous value, their general concepts can be applied in other fields like risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXPCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=%22crackpot+index%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crackpot%20index%22&amp;f=false|title=The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It|last=Hubbard|first=Douglas W.|date=2009-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470387955|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2006/01/every_field_of_/|title=Every field of study deserves its own Crackpot Index|last=Staff|first=Wired|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baez's crackpot index ==
The method, proposed semi-seriously by mathematical physicist [[John C. Baez]] in 1992, computes an index by responses to a list of 36 questions, each positive response contributing a point value ranging from 1 to 50.  The computation is initialized with a value of &amp;minus;5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html|title=Crackpot index|website=math.ucr.edu|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version only had 17 questions with point values for each ranging from 1 to 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961110050053/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html|title=Crackpot index|date=1996-11-10|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably any positive value of the index indicates crankiness.

Though the index was not proposed as a serious method, it nevertheless has become popular in Internet discussions of whether a claim or an individual is [[crank (person)|crank]]y, particularly in [[physics]] (e.g., at the [[Usenet newsgroup]] sci.physics), or in mathematics.

Chris Caldwell's [[Prime Pages]] has a version adapted to [[prime number]] research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/crackpot.html |title= ''The PrimeNumbers' Crackpot index'' |accessdate= October 23, 2007 |author=Chris Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a field with many famous unsolved problems that are easy to understand for amateur mathematicians.

== Gruenberger's measure for crackpots ==
An earlier crackpot index is Fred J. Gruenberger's "A Measure for Crackpots"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2006/P2678.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Measure for Crackpots|author=Fred J. Gruenberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in December 1962 by the [[RAND Corporation]].

'''Destratification''' is a process in which the air&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airius.co.uk/destratification/ Air Destratification]&lt;/ref&gt; or water is mixed in order to eliminate [[Lake stratification|stratified layers]] of temperature, plant, or animal life. The first example of destratification was in 1919, in a small reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp Effects of Destratification] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906100952/http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp |date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pond]]'s condition deteriorates when the [[Benthic zone|bottom environment]] cannot support animal life. The bottom is the area that runs out of oxygen first, it is where the most oxygen is used, and it is the farthest from the surface where it is replenished. Without oxygen a lake or pond's self-purification capability is not only reduced, it is reversed. The small animals, snails, worms, bacteria, etc., which help keep a pond clean cannot live, and the pond's nutrients are then recycled from the [[sediment]]. This forms a layer of [[Muck (soil)|muck]] at the bottom which serves as a fertilizer for weed and excessive [[algae]] growth. It can also cause large [[fish kill]]s.

'''Dowsing''' is a type of [[divination]] employed in attempts to locate [[ground water]], buried metals or [[ore]]s, gemstones, [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Grave (burial)|gravesites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittaker|first1=William E|title=Grave Dowsing Reconsidered|url=https://archaeology.uiowa.edu/file/726/download?token=DqQdlDVi|accessdate=21 June 2017|agency=Office of the State Archaeologist|publisher=The University of Iowa|date=23 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other objects and materials without the use of scientific apparatus.  Dowsing is considered a [[pseudoscience]], and there is no [[scientific evidence]] that it is any more effective than [[random chance]].&lt;ref name="Vogt1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogt|first=Evon Z.|author2=Ray Hyman|title=Water Witching U.S.A.|publisher=Chicago University Press|location=Chicago|year=1979|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-226-86297-2}} via {{cite book|last=Hines|first=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|year=2003|edition=Second|page=420|isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Regal|Regal, Brian]].

Dowsing is also known as '''divining''' (especially in reference to interpretation of results),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8vBAX1_UPGsC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Discovering Dowsing and Divining'', p. 5], Peter Naylor&lt;/ref&gt; '''doodlebugging'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readersandrootworkers.org/wiki/Category:Dowsing,_Doodlebugging,_and_Water_Witching|title=Dowsing, Doodlebugging, and Water Witching|work=Association of Independent Readers and Rootworkers Wiki|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=xrLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=doodlebugging+dowsing#v=onepage&amp;q=doodlebugging%20dowsing&amp;f=false | title = Keystone Folklore Quarterly | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or (when searching specifically for water) '''water finding''', '''water witching''' (in the United States) or '''water dowsing'''.

A Y-shaped twig or rod, or two L-shaped ones — individually called a '''dowsing rod''', '''divining rod''' (Latin: '''virgula divina''' or '''baculus divinatorius'''), "vining rod", or '''witching rod''' — are sometimes used during dowsing, although some dowsers use other equipment or no equipment at all.
Dowsing appears to have arisen in the context of [[Renaissance magic]] {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} in [[German Renaissance|Germany]], and it remains popular among believers in [[Forteana]] {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} or [[radiesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;As translated from one preface of the Kassel experiments, "roughly 10,000 active dowsers in Germany ''alone'' can generate a conservatively-estimated annual revenue of more than 100 million DM (US$50 million)". [http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ GWUP-Psi-Tests 2004: Keine Million Dollar für PSI-Fähigkeiten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410205142/http://www.gwup.org/psitest/ |date=April 10, 2005 }} (in German) and [http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm English version] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814114138/http://www.phact.org/e/z/kassel.htm |date=August 14, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The motion of dowsing rods is now generally attributed to the [[Ideomotor phenomenon|ideomotor response]].&lt;ref name= "Zusne 1989"&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989).

No researcher has been able to prove under controlled conditions that dowsing has any genuine divining power... A more likely explanation for the movement of a dowser's focus is the ideomotor effect, which entails involuntary and unconscious motor behavior."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, T. J; Crane, L. L.

==History==
[[File:Georgius Agricola Erzsucher.jpg|thumb|right|Dowsing for metal ore, from 1556 "[[De re metallica]] libri XII" book]]
[[File:Divining Rod.jpg|thumb|Use of a divining Rod observed in Britain in the late 18th century]]
[[File:Curious Myths p 81 rod.jpg|thumb|right]]
Dowsing as practiced today may have originated in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] during the 16th century, when it was used in attempts to find [[metal]]s.

As early as 1518 [[Martin Luther]] listed dowsing for metals as an act that broke the [[I am the Lord your God|first commandment]] (''i.e.'', as [[occultism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Decem praecepta Wittenbergensi populo praedicta'', Martin Luther&lt;/ref&gt; The 1550 edition of [[Sebastian Münster]]'s ''[[Cosmographia (Sebastian Münster)|Cosmographia]]'' contains a woodcut of a dowser with forked rod in hand walking over a cutaway image of a mining operation. The rod is labelled "Virgula Divina – Glück rüt" (Latin: divine rod; German "Wünschelrute": fortune rod or stick), but there is no text accompanying the woodcut. By 1556 [[Georgius Agricola]]'s treatment of mining and smelting of ore, ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', included a detailed description of dowsing for metal ore.&lt;ref&gt;William Barrett and [[Theodore Besterman]]. ''The Divining Rod: An Experimental and Psychological Investigation.'' (1926) Kessinger Publishing, 2004: p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...There are many great contentions between miners concerning the forked twig, for some say that it is of the greatest use in discovering veins, and others deny it. ... All alike grasp the forks of the twig with their hands, clenching their fists, it being necessary that the clenched fingers should be held toward the sky in order that the twig should be raised at that end where the two branches meet. Then they wander hither and thither at random through mountainous regions. It is said that the moment they place their feet on a vein the twig immediately turns and twists, and so by its action discloses the vein ; when they move their feet again and go away from that spot the twig becomes once more immobile. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agricola|first1=Georgius|title=De Re Metallica|date=1556|location=Basel|page=38ff|edition=tr.

In the sixteenth century, German deep mining technology was in enormous demand all over Europe. [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon#Early modern period|German miners]] were licensed to live and work in [[Elizabethan England]];&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1215&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[Stannaries]] of [[Devon]] &amp; [[Cornwall]] and in [[Cumbria]]. In other parts of England, the technique was used in Elizabeth's royal mines  for [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]]. By 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales.&lt;ref name = JWG&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gough|first1=John Weidhofft|title=The Mines of Mendip|date=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|oclc=163035417|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-mining area of the [[Mendip Hills]] in Somerset in the 17th century the natural philosopher [[Robert Boyle]], inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a  practitioner try to find "latent veins of metals". Boyle saw the hazel divining rod ("virgula divinatoria") stoop in the hands of the diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man's genuine belief  but himself remained unconvinced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyle|first1=Robert|year=1661|title=Works|volume=One|publisher=[[Thomas Birch]]|pages=342–3|edition=1743|chapter=On Unsucceeding Experiments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dowsing in search of water is considered an ancient practice by some, old texts about searching for water do not mention using the divining rod, and the first account of this practice was in 1568.&lt;ref name="spooky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Sharon A. |author-link=Sharon A.

[[William F. Barrett|Sir William F. Barrett]] wrote in his 1911 book ''Psychical Research'' that: 
{{quote|...in a recent admirable Life of St. Teresa of Spain, the following incident is narrated: Teresa in 1568 was offered the site for a convent to which there was only one objection, there was no water supply; happily, a Friar Antonio came up with a twig in his hand, stopped at a certain spot and appeared to be making the sign of the cross; but Teresa says, "Really I cannot be sure if it were the sign he made, at any rate he made some movement with the twig and then he said, ' Dig just here ' ; they dug, and lo ! a plentiful fount of water gushed forth, excellent for 'drinking, copious for washing, and it never ran dry.' " As the writer of this Life remarks : " Teresa, not having heard of dowsing, has no explanation for this event," and regarded it as a miracle. This, I believe, is the first historical reference to dowsing for water.&lt;ref name="Barrett_Psychical Research_p171"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=William|title=Psychical Research|date=1911|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.

In 1662, dowsing was declared to be "superstitious, or rather [[satan]]ic" by a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[Gaspar Schott]], though he later noted that he wasn't sure that the devil was always responsible for the movement of the rod.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Eugène Chevreul]], ''De La Baguette Divinatoire du pendule dit explorateur at des table tournants au point de vue de l'histoire, de la critique, and de la méthode expérimentale'', Paris, 1854. "''Le père Gaspard Schott (jés.) considère l'usage de la baguette comme superstitieux ou plutôt diabolique, mais des renseignements qui lui furent donnés plus tard par des hommes qu'il considérait comme religieux et probe, lui firent dire dans une notation à ce passage, qu'il ne voudrait pas assurer que le demon fait toujours ''tourner'' la baguette.''" (''Physica Curiosa'', 1662, lib. XII, cap. IV, pag. 1527). See [https://books.google.com/books?id=kzsAAAAAQAAJ facsimile] on [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the South of France in the 17th century it was used in tracking criminals and [[heresy|heretics]]. Its abuse led to a decree of the inquisition in 1701, forbidding its employment for purposes of justice.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Divining-rod |volume=8 |pages=333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[epigram]] by Samuel Sheppard, from ''Epigrams theological, philosophical, and romantick'' (1651) runs thus:

:''Virgula divina''.
:"Some Sorcerers do boast they have a Rod,
:Gather'd with Vowes and Sacrifice,
:And (borne about) will strangely nod
:To hidden Treasure where it lies;
:Mankind is (sure) that Rod divine,
:For to the Wealthiest (ever) they incline."

Early attempts at an explanation of dowsing were based on the notion that the divining rod was physically affected by emanations from substances of interest. The following explanation is from [[William Pryce]]'s 1778 ''Mineralogia Cornubiensis'':

{{quote|The corpuscles... that rise from the Minerals, entering the rod, determine it to bow down, in order to render it parallel to the vertical lines which the effluvia describe in their rise. In effect the Mineral particles seem to be emitted from the earth; now the Virgula [rod], being of a light porous wood, gives an easy passage to these particles, which are also very fine and subtle; the effluvia then driven forwards by those that follow them, and pressed at the same time by the atmosphere incumbent on them, are forced to enter the little interstices between the fibres of the wood, and by that effort they oblige it to incline, or dip down perpendicularly, to become parallel with the little columns which those vapours form in their rise.}}

A study towards the end of the nineteenth century concluded that the phenomenon was attributed to cryptesthesia, whereby the practitioner made unconscious observations of the terrain  and involuntarily influenced the movement of the rod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pass|first1=A.C.|last2=Tawney|first2=Edward. B.|title=The divining rod|journal=Proceedings|date=1876|volume=I|pages=60 et seq|publisher=[[Bristol Naturalists' Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowsing was conducted in South Dakota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to help homesteaders, farmers, and ranchers locate water wells on their property.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Fairchild and Walker D. Wyman, Frontier Woman: The Life of a Woman Homesteader on the Dakota Frontier (River Falls: University of Wisconsin-River Falls Press, 1972), 50; Robert Amerson, From the Hidewood: Memories of a Dakota Neighborhood (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1996), 290–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s during the [[Vietnam War]], some [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] used dowsing to attempt to locate weapons and tunnels.&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;FIX ME (could not access entire article) {{cite web |

Traditionally, the most common dowsing rod is a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer branches from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. [[Hazel]] twigs in Europe and [[witch-hazel]] in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from [[willow]] or [[Peach|peach trees]]. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. Often the branches are grasped palms down. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where he suspects the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod is expected to dip, incline or twitch when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as "willow witching".

===L-Rods===
[[File:Allemanswiro.jpg|thumb|left|Two L-shaped metal wire rods]]
Many dowsers today use a pair of simple L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm pointing forward. When something is "found", the rods cross over one another. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods may be fashioned from wire coat hangers or wire flags used for locating utilities. Glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century [[New England]].

[[James Randi]] offered a US$10,000 prize to any successful dowser. The three-day test of some 30 dowsers involved plastic pipes through which water flow could be controlled and directed. The pipes were buried {{convert|50|cm|in|1|sp=us|lk=on}} under a level field, the position of each marked on the surface with a colored strip. The dowsers had to tell whether water was running through each pipe. All the dowsers signed a statement agreeing this was a fair test of their abilities and that they expected a 100 percent success rate. However, the results were no better than chance, thus no one was awarded the prize.

===Betz 1990 study===
In a 1987–88 study in Munich by [[Hans-Dieter Betz]] and other scientists, 500 dowsers were initially tested for their skill, and the experimenters selected the best 43 among them for further tests. Water was pumped through a pipe on the ground floor of a two-storey barn. Before each test, the pipe was moved in a direction perpendicular to the water flow. On the upper floor, each dowser was asked to determine the position of the pipe. Over two years, the dowsers performed 843 such tests and, of the 43 pre-selected and extensively tested candidates, at least 37 showed no dowsing ability. The results from the remaining 6 were said to be better than chance, resulting in the experimenters' conclusion that some dowsers "in particular tasks, showed an extraordinarily high rate of success, which can scarcely if at all be explained as due to chance&amp;nbsp;... a real core of dowser-phenomena can be regarded as empirically proven."&lt;ref name=munich_study_quote&gt;Wagner, H., H.-D.

Five years after the Munich study was published, [[Jim T.

Psychologist [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] in a 1986 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' included dowsing in a list of "effects which until recently were claimed to be paranormal but which can now be explained from within orthodox science."&lt;ref name="marks1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marks|first=David F.|authorlink= David Marks (psychologist)|date=March 13, 1986|title=Investigating the paranormal|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|volume=320|pages=119–124|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/320119a0|pmid=3951553|issue=6058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, dowsing could be explained in terms of [[sensory cue]]s, [[Observer-expectancy effect|expectancy effects]] and [[probability]].&lt;ref name="marks1986" /&gt;

Science writer [[Peter Daempfle]] has noted that when dowsing is subjected to scientific testing, it fails. Daempfle has written that although some dowsers claim success, this can be attributed to the underground [[water table]] being distributed relatively uniformly in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Daempfle|Daempfle, Peter]].

In regard to dowsing and its use in archaeology, [[Kenneth Feder]] has written that "the vast majority of archaeologists don't use dowsing, because they don't believe it works."&lt;ref name="Feder 2010"/&gt;

Psychologist [[Chris French]] has noted that "dowsing does not work when it is tested under properly controlled conditions that rule out the use of other cues to indicate target location."&lt;ref name="French 2013"/&gt;

A report in [[The Guardian]] on the subject of British water company employees using dowsing, including from Anglian and Severn Trent, noted that "The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. [[Ofwat]] said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty." Anglian Water also attested to "the effectiveness of dowsing rods".&lt;ref name="guardian2017"/&gt;
A similar report from the [[BBC]] noted "All the companies emphasised they do not encourage the use of divining rods nor issue them to engineers, and said modern methods such as drones and listening devices were preferred."&lt;ref name="bbc2017"/&gt;

'''Extraterrestrial life''',&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Where "extraterrestrial" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''extra'' ("beyond", "not of") and ''[[wikt:terrestris|terrestris]]'' ("of [[Earth]]", "belonging to Earth").&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''alien life''' (or, if it is a [[Sentience|sentient]] or relatively complex [[Individual#Biology|individual]], an "extraterrestrial" or "alien"), is [[life]] that occurs outside of Earth and that probably did not originate from [[Earth]].

The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as [[exobiology]].

Since the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence|search for extraterrestrial intelligent life]].

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of [[science fiction]]. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Some encourage aggressive methods to try for contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others—citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less advanced societies—argue that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |title=Scientists in US are urged to seek contact with aliens |work=BBC News |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity?

Alien life, such as [[microorganism]]s, has been hypothesized to exist in the [[Solar System]] and throughout the universe.

===Evolution===
A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes "Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-10-31-aliens-may-be-more-us-we-think |title=Aliens may be more like us than we think |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [[Planetary habitability|niches a planet]] contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary exobiology: Towards the qualitative assessment of biological potential on exoplanets |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |first1=David S. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Sean |last2=Large |date=25 October 2017 |doi=10.1017/S1473550417000349 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemical basis==
{{Main article|Biochemistry|Hypothetical types of biochemistry|Water#Effects on life}}
Life on Earth requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on [[terrestrial planet]]s with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=Jade C. |last2=O'Brien |first2=David P. |last3=Lauretta |first3=Dante S. |title=The Compositional Diversity of Extrasolar Terrestrial Planets.

It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid [[hydrocarbon]], such as [[methane]], [[ethane]] or [[propane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/read/11919/chapter/8#74 |chapter=6.2.2: Nonpolar Solvents |title=The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems |publisher=The National Academies Press |author=National Research Council |page=74 |date=2007 |doi=10.17226/11919 |isbn=978-0-309-10484-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Utopia and Back: The Search for Life in the Solar System |publisher=W.

According to NASA's 2015 Astrobiology Strategy, "Life on other worlds is most likely to include microbes, and any complex living system elsewhere is likely to have arisen from and be founded upon microbial life. Important insights on the limits of microbial life can be gleaned from studies of microbes on modern Earth, as well as their ubiquity and ancestral characteristics."&lt;ref name="NASA strategy 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nai.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2015/10/NASA_Astrobiology_Strategy_2015_151008.pdf |title=NASA Astrobiology Strategy 2015 |publisher=NASA |editor1-first=Lindsay |editor1-last=Hays |page=65 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the [[Solar System]], it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere ([[Exogenesis (astrobiology)|exogenesis]]). The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse |first=Margaret R. |last=O'Leary |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Analysis of the Alais meteorite and implications about life in other worlds |journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] |first=Jöns Jacob |last=Berzelius |author-link=Jöns Jacob Berzelius |volume=10 |pages=134–135 |date=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] (1871),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The British Association Meeting at Edinburgh |journal=Nature |first=William |last=Thomson |author-link=William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin |volume=4 |issue=92 |pages=261–278 |date=August 1871 |doi=10.1038/004261a0 |bibcode=1871Natur...4..261. |quote=We must regard it as probably to the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoritic stones moving through space. |pmc=2070380}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1879)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darwin's Contribution to the Development of the Panspermia Theory |journal=Astrobiology |first=René |last=Demets |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=946–950 |date=October 2012 |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0790 |pmid=23078643 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..946D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, somewhat later, by [[Svante Arrhenius]] (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakingev00arrhrich |title=Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |first=Svante |last=Arrhenius |others=trans.

[[Sir Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001) and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for [[macroevolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hoyle.org.uk/resources/virusesfromspacecompressed.pdf |title=Viruses from Space and Related Matters |publisher=University College Cardiff Press |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |first2=Chandra |last2=Wickramasinghe |first3=John |last3=Watson |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-906449-93-6 |bibcode=1986vfsr.book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.
The Nobel prize winner [[Francis Crick]], along with [[Leslie Orgel]] proposed that seeds of life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,&lt;ref name="Crick_Orgel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Crick |first=F.

===Venus===
{{Main article|Life on Venus}}
In the early 20th century, Venus was often thought to be similar to Earth in terms of habitability, but observations since the beginning of the [[Space Age]] have revealed that Venus's surface is inhospitable to Earth-like life. However, between an altitude of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it has been speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html |title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life |work=New Scientist |first=Stuart |last=Clark |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.&lt;ref name="Tritt2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch2001"/&gt; [[Hydrothermal vent]]s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="EuropaPlanetary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |title=Projects: Europa Mission Campaign |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Louis |last=Friedman |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002508/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europa Capable of Supporting Life, Scientist Says |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |year=2009 |publisher=Universe Today |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/08/europa-capable-of-supporting-life-scientist-says/ |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/huge-lakes-of-water-may-exist-under-europas-ice/ |title=Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice |series=Bad Astronomy Blog |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/scientists-find-evidence-for-great-lake-on-europa/ |title=Scientists Find Evidence for "Great Lake" on Europa and Potential New Habitat for Life |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn system===
Titan and Enceladus have been speculated to have possible habitats supportive of life.

[[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the largest [[Moons of Saturn|moon of Saturn]], is the only known moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere.

===Other bodies===
Models of heat retention and heating via [[radioactive decay]] in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km thick.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2006.06.005| last1 = Hussmann| first1 = Hauke| last2 = Sohl| first2 = Frank| last3 = Spohn| first3 = Tilman| date = November 2006| title = Subsurface oceans and deep interiors of medium-sized outer planet satellites and large trans-neptunian objects| journal = [[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]| volume = 185| issue = 1| pages = 258–273| url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tilman_Spohn/publication/225019299_Subsurface_Oceans_and_Deep_Interiors_of_Medium-Sized_Outer_Planet_Satellites_and_Large_Trans-Neptunian_Objects/links/55018a3a0cf24cee39f7b952.pdf| bibcode = 2006Icar..185..258H| ref = {{sfnRef|Hussmann Sohl et al.|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water. This is in contrast with the oceans that may be inside larger icy satellites like Ganymede, Callisto, or Titan, where layers of high-pressure [[Ice V|phases of ice]] are thought to underlie the liquid water layer.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006" /&gt;

==Scientific search==
The scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. {{As of|2017|09}}, 3,667 [[exoplanet]]s in 2,747 [[Planetary system|systems]] have been [[Exoplanet|identified]], and other planets and moons in our own solar system hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as [[microorganism]]s.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute – Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]].&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system.

J. |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=243–250 |date=2006 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=597376&amp;fileId=S1473550406003107 |doi=10.1017/S1473550406003107 |bibcode=2006IJAsB...5..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Drake equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''N'' = the number of Milky Way galaxy [[civilization]]s already capable of communicating across [[interplanetary space]]

and
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:''L'' = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

&lt;math&gt;10{,}000 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 \cdot 10{,}000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aguirre |first=L. |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Drake Equation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/drake.html |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: What does a Martian look like? |title=[[Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life]] |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |first1=Jack |last1=Cohen |author1-link=Jack Cohen (scientist) |first2=Ian |last2=Stewart |author2-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |date=2002 |isbn=0-09-187927-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led critics to label the equation a [[guesstimate]], or even meaningless.

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main article|Cosmic pluralism}}
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html |title=Who discovered that the Sun was a Star? |publisher=Stanford Solar Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4TZPlihVUoC |title=The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900 |first=Michael J. |last=Crowe |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1999 |isbn=0-486-40675-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin D. |last=Wiker |date=4 November 2002 |title=Alien Ideas: Christianity and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |work=Crisis Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210140752/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |archivedate=10 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion |first=Robert |last=Irwin |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-86064-983-1 |page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim writers like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] and [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Copernican revolution]]s, and later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in his 1686 work ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds |publisher=University of California Press |first=Bernard le Bovier |last=de Fontenelle |others=trans. H. A. Hargreaves |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-520-91058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and astronomers such as [[William Herschel]]. The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html |title=Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that "if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in "Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds" (1647).
In "The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: "We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested "our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===
[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canals]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experiments as to the actuality of the "Canals" observed on Mars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first1=J. E. |last1=Evans |first2=E. W. |last2=Maunder |author2-link=Edward Walter Maunder |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=488–499 |date=June 1903 |doi=10.1093/mnras/63.8.488 |bibcode=1903MNRAS..63..488E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization.&lt;ref name="Wallace1907"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm |title=Is Mars Habitable? A Critical Examination of Professor Lowell's Book "Mars and Its Canals," With an Alternative Explanation |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |first=Alfred Russel |last=Wallace |date=1907 |oclc=8257449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of life on Mars led British writer [[H. G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |year=1999 |doi= |isbn=0-7137-2747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the "Martian invasion" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably "[[Sector Four|Area 51]]" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet |url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says |url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/ |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[exoplanet]] [[Kepler-62f]] was discovered, along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]]. A related [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132.toc special issue] of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.&lt;ref name="SCI-20130503"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special Issue: Exoplanets |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/exoplanets/ |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2014, the discovery of the Earth-size exoplanet [[Kepler-186f]], 500 light-years from [[Earth]], was publicly announced;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140417"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Scientists Find an 'Earth Twin', or Maybe a Cousin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/science/space/scientists-find-an-earth-twin-or-maybe-a-cousin.html |date=17 April 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the first Earth-size planet to be discovered in the [[habitable zone]] and it has been hypothesized that there may be liquid water on its surface.

On 20 July 2015, British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], along with the [[SETI Institute]], announced a well-funded effort, called the [[Breakthrough Initiatives]], to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.

'''''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science''''' (1957)—originally published in 1952 as '''''In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present'''''&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;—was [[Martin Gardner]]'s second book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dover - the publisher of the book's second edition - had published a collection of mathematical puzzles the year before, and Gardner had already written many articles throughout the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of what it described as [[pseudoscience]]s and cult beliefs, it became a founding document in the nascent [[scientific skepticism]] movement. [[Michael Shermer]] said of it: "Modern skepticism has developed into a science-based movement, beginning with Martin Gardner's 1952 classic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|date=2002|publisher=Henry Holt|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7089-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book [[Debunker|debunks]] what it characterises as [[pseudoscience|pseudo-science]] and the pseudo-scientists who propagate it.

==Contents==

===Synopsis===
''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'' starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of "cranks" and "pseudo-scientists", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: "If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting ''questionable'' theses to be published".  Gardner acknowledges that "among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view", but adds that "a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable" because otherwise "science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along."

Gardner says that cranks have ''two'' common characteristics. The first "and most important" is that they work in almost total isolation from the [[scientific community]]. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published — such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; But the crank "stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent."

The second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are ''five'' ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested.

#The pseudo-scientist considers himself a genius.
#He regards other researchers as stupid, dishonest or both.
#He believes there is a campaign against his ideas, a campaign comparable to the persecution of [[Galileo]] or [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]]. He may attribute his "persecution" to a conspiracy by a scientific "masonry" who are unwilling to admit anyone to their inner sanctum without appropriate initiation.
#Instead of side-stepping the mainstream, the pseudo-scientist attacks it head-on: The most revered scientist is [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] so Gardner writes that Einstein is the most likely establishment figure to be attacked.
#He has a tendency to use complex jargon, often making up words and phrases. Gardner compares this to the way that schizophrenics talk in what psychiatrists call "neologisms", "words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like [[Jabberwocky]] to everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular "fads" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. ''Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science'').

==History==
The 1957 [[Dover Publications|Dover]] publication is a revised and expanded version of ''In the Name of Science'', which was published by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in 1952.  The subtitle boldly states the book's theme: "The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them. A study in human gullibility". As of 2005, it had been reprinted at least 30 times.

The book was expanded from an article first published in the ''[[Antioch Review]]'' in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the preface to the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article as the starting point of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Not all material in the article is carried over to the book. For example, in the article, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And comments in a footnote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is not within the scope of this paper, however, to discuss technical criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, but at the same time is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific "orthodoxy" may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of "pseudo-science." Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams touch only in the rarest of instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1950}} p. 456, n.4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While in the book, Gardner writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a detailed refutation.  “A fairly complete textbook of physics would be only part of the answer to Velikovsky,” writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his excellent article on “Cranks and Scientists” (''Scientific Monthly'', Nov., 1951), “and it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find the undertaking worth while.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the wrap-up of the chapter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as an experienced doctor is able to diagnose certain ailments the instant a new patient walks into his office, or a police officer learns to recognize criminal types from subtle behavior clues which escape the untrained eye, so we, perhaps, may learn to recognize the future scientific crank when we first encounter him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
A contemporary review in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' particularly welcomed Gardner's critical remarks about [[Hoxsey Therapy]] and about [[Krebiozen]], both of which were being advanced as anti-cancer measures at that time. The review concluded that the book "should help to counteract some amusing and some positively harmful cults, the existence of which is all too often promoted by irresponsible journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Study of the Strange Growth of Pseudo-Science |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t3xIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3392,2509292&amp;dq=in-the-name-of-science+gardner&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=November 16, 1957 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has often been mentioned in subsequent books and articles. [[Louis Lasagna]], in his book ''The Doctors' Dilemmas'', considered it to be a "superb account of scientific cults, fads, and frauds" and wrote that "This talented writer combines solid fact with a pleasing style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The doctors' dilemmas |last=Lasagna |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Lasagna |year=1970 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=292 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiLMdjrSFeEC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist of religion [[Anson D. Shupe]] took in general a positive attitude, and praises Gardner for his humor. But he says&lt;blockquote&gt;
If there is a single criticism to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like "quack", "crank" and "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always on the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.&lt;ref name=shupe&gt;{{cite book |title=Six perspectives on new religions: a case study approach |last= Shupe |first=Anson D.|authorlink= Anson D. Shupe |year=1981 |isbn= 0-88946-333-6 |publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press  |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhDcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DvlYTaiSJYOUtwef9LyADQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1980s a fierce interchange took place between Gardner and [[Colin Wilson]].  In ''The Quest for Wilhelm Reich'' Wilson wrote of this book&lt;blockquote&gt;(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain ''he'' is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so ''sure'' that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] once remarked wryly "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling.&lt;ref name=reichquest&gt;{{cite book| title=The Quest for Wilhelm Reich| first=Colin| last=Wilson| authorlink=Colin Wilson| year=1981| publisher=Granada Publishing|pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence.&lt;ref name=NYRJune&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/jun/15/ghosts-poltergeists/ letter, New York Review of Books, June 15, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' describing Wilson as "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene".&lt;ref name=NYRFeb&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1989/feb/16/paranormal-companionship/ letter, New York Review of Books, February 16, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of [[CSICOP]]—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...".&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt; Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..."&lt;ref name=NYRJune/&gt;

In a review of a subsequent Gardner work, Paul Stuewe of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called ''Fads and Fallacies'' a "hugely enjoyable demolition of pseudo-scientific nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics and biography make strange bedfellows |author=Paul Stuewe |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471222021.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+17,+1990&amp;author=Paul+Stuewe&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Politics+and+biography+make+strange+bedfellows&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=March 17, 1990 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', considered the book to be "the classic put-down of pseudoscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There's One Born Every Minute |author=Ed Regis  |authorlink=Ed Regis (author)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/04/reviews/000604.04regist.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow skeptic [[Michael Shermer]] called the book "''the'' skeptic classic of the past half-century." He noted that the mark of popularity for the book came when [[John W. Campbell]] denounced the chapter on dianetics over the radio.&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book |title=The borderlands of science: where sense meets nonsense |last=Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Shermer|coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location= |isbn= |page=50 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCanmmIb8QUC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HPNYTcOpEMK4tgf5hdWWDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Erickson, author of ''Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century'', noted that Gardner's book provided "a flavour of the immense optimism surrounding science in the 1950s" and that his choice of topics were "interesting", but also that his attacks on "osteopathy, chiropractice, and the Bates method for correcting eyesight would raise eyebrows amongst medical practitioners today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century |last=Erickson |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Polity |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=150–151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NgajQBd_6AC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=%22Fads+and+Fallacies+in+the+Name+of+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BPtYTc27BIW4tweY54XVDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fads%20and%20Fallacies%20in%20the%20Name%20of%20Science%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner’s own response to criticism is given in his preface:
:The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gardner|1957}} preface&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2Bio Field Trip Waiake.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Biology students on a field trip to Waiake Beach in [[Torbay, New Zealand]]]]
A '''field trip''' or '''[[excursion]]''' is a journey by a group of people to a place away from their normal environment. When done for students, it is also known as '''school trip''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[New Zealand]], '''school tour''' in the [[Philippines]], '''''Ensoku''''' {{Nihongo|遠足|Ensoku}} ('Excursion') in [[Japan]] and '''Klassenfahrt''' in [[Germany]].

The purpose of the trip is usually ''[[observation]]'' for [[education]], non-experimental [[research]] or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this [[research]] is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide a common ground with more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to have some of the same cultural experiences in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene, Kisida, Bowen|first1=Jay P., Brian, Daniel H.|title=The Educational Value of Field Trips|url=http://educationnext.org/the-educational-value-of-field-trips/|website=Education Next|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field trips are most often done in 3 steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the student and the teacher. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities that happen on the field trips often include: [[Lecture|lectures]], [[tours]], [[Worksheet|worksheets]], videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions that occur in the classroom once the field trip is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bitgood|first1=Stephen|title=School Field Trips: An Overview|date=Summer 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]] people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a [[geological]] or [[geographical]] feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the [[natural sciences]] was of this form. [[Charles Darwin]] is an important example of someone who has contributed to [[science]] through the use of field trips.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Popular field trip sites include [[Zoo|zoos]], [[nature centers]], [[community agencies]] such as fire stations and [[Hospital|hospitals]], [[Government agency|government agencies]], [[Businesses|local businesses]], [[amusement parks]], [[Science museum|science museums]], and [[factories]]. Not only do field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children, they can also benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also provide students the opportunity to take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive displays that allow children to touch plants or animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kulas|first1=Michelle|title=What are the Benefits of Field Trips for Children?|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/127612-benefits-field-trips-children/|website=LIVESTRONG.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the country report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]] at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the [[American Association of School Administrators]] found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Educational Value of Field Trips|url=http://educationnext.org/the-educational-value-of-field-trips/|website=Education Next|publisher=EdNext|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site school ==
A variation on the field trip is the "site-based program" or "site-school" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site.  The approach was first developed at the [[Calgary Zoo]] in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and "Zoo School" was inaugurated in 1994.  The [[Calgary Board of Education]] then approached the [[Glenbow Museum and Archives]] to create a "Museum School" in 1995 followed by the [[Calgary Science Centre]] (1996), the [[University of Calgary]] (1996), [[Canada Olympic Park]] (1997), the [[Inglewood Bird Sanctuary]] (1998), [[Calgary City Hall]] (2000), [[Cross Conservation Area]] (2000), the [[Calgary Stampede]] (2002), the [[Calgary Aero-Space Museum]] (2005), and the [[Fire Training Academy]] (2008).  The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and to the United States.  Global coordination of the model is through the "Beyond the Classroom Network".&lt;ref&gt;http://btcn.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

A somewhat similar model in France called ''classe de mer'' (sea class), ''classe de neige'' (snow class), or ''classe verte'' (green class) involving [[outdoor education]] trips that last several days, however these may not involve support from museum or zoo staff as in the Canadian model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues. GPoT Center published its first two books on Cyprus issue in the summer 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.cc/index.php/lang/en/cat/2/news/50924 BRT: Rauf Denktash and Michael Moran write a book]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then published other books on developments in Cyprus, Israeli-Turkish relations, as well as [[democratization]] of the [[Middle East]].

== Partners and Networks ==

The Center cooperates with institutions from [[Sweden]] - SIIA, [[Lebanon]] - CAUS, [[Qatar]] - ADF, [[United Kingdom]] - LSE, [[Czech Republic]] - EUROPEUM, [[Slovak Republic]] - SFPA, [[Armenia]] - EPF, YPC and Internews, [[Egypt]] - Ibn-Khaldun Center, and [[France]] - ENS. GPoT Center is also part of larger research and academic networks such as the United Nations's [[Alliance of Civilizations]], International Research and Security Network, [[United Nations]]' Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures.

'''''Interpretation of Schizophrenia''''' (first edition, 1955) is a book by Italy-born American [[psychiatrist]] [[Silvano Arieti]] in which the author sets forth [[demonstrative evidence]] of a [[psychological]] [[etiology]] for [[schizophrenia]].

Arieti expanded the book vastly in 1974 ({{ISBN|0-465-03429-2}}) and that edition won the U.S. [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#The Sciences|Science category]].&lt;ref name=nba1975&gt;
[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html "National Book Awards – 1975"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909065656/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1975.html |date=2011-09-09 }}. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' is a 756-page book divided in 45 chapters. Arieti begins his book stating that it is difficult to define schizophrenia.  He asks if schizophrenia is an [[Mental illness|illness]] and answers in the negative, since the disorder is not understood in classic [[Rudolf Virchow|Virchowian]] criterion of cellular [[pathology]].  Though those searching for a [[biological psychiatry|biological basis]] of schizophrenia far outnumber those undertaking [[Psychology|psychological]] approaches, Arieti supports the [[Trauma model|minority view]].  He believes schizophrenia is an unrealistic way to represent both the self and the world and praises psychiatrist [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] for stressing the importance of psychological factors in the etiology of schizophrenia.  Arieti also mentions that [[Freud]] felt that in schizophrenia the patient's relationship with people is handicapped (an observation that resembles what presently is called ''[[autism]]'').

==Family as a cause==

Arieti then describes the psychogenic factors that lead to the disorder.  The family environment and psychodynamics in the etiology of [[psychosis]] comes under scrutiny.  Arieti describes the building of [[neurosis|neurotic]] and psychotic defense mechanisms; the emerging schizoid personality, and fully developed schizophrenia understood as an injury to the [[Self (psychology)|inner self]].  Arieti believes that a state of extreme [[anxiety]] originating in early [[childhood]] produces vulnerability for the whole life of the individual.

A characteristic of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is a prolonged childhood with a consequently extended dependency on adults.  This, according to Arieti, "is the basis of the psychodynamics of schizophrenia", a claim that also appears in later writers on [[child abuse]] such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and Colin Ross.  Arieti reviews the paper by [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]] about the  [[Theodore Lidz#.E2.80.9CSchizophrenogenic.E2.80.9D parents|"schizophrenogenic" mother]] and reaches the tentative conclusion that only 25 percent of the mothers of people with schizophrenia in his clinical experience fit that image.  However, he adds that only in a minority of schizophrenia cases "the child is able to retain the good maternal image".  Arieti also mentions the work of [[Theodore Lidz]], another [[trauma model]] author of schizophrenia.  Like Lidz, Arieti emphasizes the weakness of the father of the patient with schizophrenia in the paternal role.  In Arieti's own words:

:''In the first edition of this book I have described one family constellation [...] when a domineering, nagging and hostile mother, who gives the child no chance to assert himself, is married to a dependent, weak man, who is too weak to help the child [...].  In these families the weak parent [...] becomes antagonistic and [[Hostility|hostile]] toward the children because [...] he displaces his anger from the spouse to the children, as the spouse is too strong to be a suitable target.''

The roles can be reversed when the domineering spouse is the father.  Arieti is convinced that each schizophrenia case is representative of those human situations in which something went extremely wrong.  "If we ignore it, we become deaf to a profound message that the patient may try to convey".  For example, Arieti states about one of his patients that "his adolescence was a crescendo of frustration, anxiety and injury to self-esteem".  Arieti also mentions a catatonic patient who, after [[Introjection|introjecting]] the mother's engulfing behavior, believed that by moving he could produce havoc.  The patient's feelings, according to Arieti, became reminiscent of cosmic powers that may cause the destruction of the universe, so the patient chose immobility.  For Arieti, the selectivity of certain motor actions is proof that [[catatonia]] is not a biological disease or illness, but rather a disorder of the will.

==Inner world of the schizophrenic==

In Part three of ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti describes how in spite of its efforts to stay in reality, the patient's defenses finally succumb.  When the patient "cannot change the unbearable situation of himself any longer, he has to change reality".  Arieti examines the inner world of the person with schizophrenia.

When a patient states he is [[Jesus]] he is compensating a feeling of extreme [[humiliation]] at home.  The [[Paranoia|paranoid]] schizophrenic, Arieti explains, resorts to "teleologic causality" or [[animism]] to understand the world.  He writes that whatever occurs to the patient is interpreted as willed by the parental [[Dissociative identity disorder|alters]] of the patient.  In deterministic or teleologic causality, if [[Nature]]'s happenings were not willed they simply would not occur.  In paranoid [[projection (psychology)|projection]] the schizophrenic takes out from him/herself a disagreeable part of the self onto the world.  In ''Interpretation of schizophrenia'' Arieti illustrates all of the above theoretical constructions with concrete cases of his clinical experience as a psychiatrist.

Arieti maintains that in every case of schizophrenia that he studied serious [[dysfunctional family|family disturbance]] was found.  When the patient idealizes the parent the idealized image of the parent is maintained in the patient's mind at the expense of an unbearable [[self-image]].  He speculates that psychosis starts only when the malevolent image of the parent is transformed "into a distressing other".  The parent or parents alters enter the mind accusing the patient of "bad child" or other equivalent accusations in voices that the [[Hearing Voices Movement|adult patient hears]].

Since the 1980s, and into the beginnings of 21st century, [[Biological psychiatry|biological psychiatric]] models of schizophrenia almost completely took over the [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] profession.  Current research into the disorder focuses on [[neurobiology]].  Psychological approaches to schizophrenia like Arieti's are a rarity in the profession, although this structurally created circumstance neglects the obvious connection between psychological phenomena and [[neurotransmitter]] levels, which can be changed through certain practices, like [[Yoga]], [[meditation]], [[hyperventilation]], [[sensory deprivation]], [[sleep deprivation]], among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17259">'''Living educational theory''' ('''LET''') is a research method in educational research.

==Overview==
The idea of [[action research]] as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. Carson and Sumara transformed the concept of traditional action research with the idea that, ..." participation in action research practices are particular ways of living and understanding that require more of the researcher than the "application" of research methods. Rather, action research is a lived practice that requires that the researcher not only investigate the subject at hand but, as well, provide some account of the way in which the investigation both shapes and is shaped by the investigator {{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xii}}. This requires what [[Martin Buber]] called an "[[I and Thou|I-Thou]]" approach toward other and this approach applied to action research as well. To make Buber's language more modern and accessible, LET translated Buber's "I-Thou" approach toward another human being to an "I/you/we" approach to action research. This differs greatly from an approach to living theory action research imagined by Jack Whitehead (2002){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} where he imagines living theory action research as forming an "I-theory" of knowledge. Director of the [[Philosophy for Children]] Project at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] William Barry proposes LET focuses on the connections between the researcher and the other person or subject where the lives of action researchers are inextricable linked in a profound manner with the individuals and communities involved in the subject of study. LET from a Barryian perspective is a [[critical theory]] and [[emancipation|emancipatory]] action research approach which seeks the dialectic, not debate and battles of [discourse].

A major difference of William Barry's version of living educational theory, which was the focus of his successful completion of a Ph.D. thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]], UK, is the essential question behind the living educational theory approach to action research ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012b}}|2012b]]). The question is not "How can I generate a living legacy for myself through an I-It theory approach toward knowledge and other forms of life?" Rather the essential question is, "How does one conduct a life that includes the practice of educational action research?"{{harv|Carson|Sumara|1997| p=xvii}} The theory/practice problem disappears when honesty about one's biases regarding spiritual, existential, and emotional intelligence are made clear in the action research process.

The phraseology "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009 because of her willingness to be transparent about her values and intentions. Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research. In 2013, Whitehead and McNiff separated as collaborators as McNiff saw spiritual, emotional intelligence as key to action research while Whitehead disagreed and believed that media accounts (primarily video tapping people) of action research could provide clues to virtues which held the future of humanity though energy flowing examples of collaboration. McNiff stated in a May 2013 conference she San Francisco, California (ARNA Conference){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} that she would never appear or work with Whitehead again. She repeated this message again months later at a UK conference in York. American  William Barry believed the concept of LET was too important and found a dialectic between McNiff and Whitehead and he created a new understanding of LET which was presented at a three-day international conference in 2013 at [[Liverpool Hope University]] titled, "Researching Our Own Practice" {{harv|Barry|2013}}.

== Definition ==

Living educational theory was first clearly defined and developed by California Professor of Philosophy [[William Barry (educator)|William Barry]] (2012b) in [[Liz Atkins]] and [[Susan Wallace (educator)|Susan Wallace]]'s book {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012}}, ''Qualitative Research in Education'', co-published by [[Sage Publications|Sage]] and the [[British Educational Research Association]] (BERA). This book was one of four in a series sponsored by the BERA regarding best practice progressive research methods in educational research. The originality and uniqueness of Barry's development of living educational theory (LET) action research is the importance of gaining ''ontological weight'' through the action research process. Ontological weight empowers the researcher's ability, and the ability of other people involved in the action research project, to have the research experience and focus of the research be transformational and add, or at least reinforce, a sense of meaning in learning and life. Barry was influenced to use the concept "ontological weight" by the existentialist Catholic philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]] (1963).{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The idea of action research as a living practice entered the mainstream of action research from the book, "Action Research as a Living Practice" by Terrance Carson and Dennis Sumara in 1997. The term "educational theory" originated with the work of [[Jack Whitehead]], a former lecturer at the [[University of Bath]], and it was further developed and greatly improved methodologically by [[Jean McNiff]] in 2009.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} Whitehead's main emphasis for conducting research is to promote the individual under the guise of collaboration and research outcomes must be captured on video for authentic validation. Whitehead's view of action research promotes that living educational theory (he uses living theory and living educational theory interchangeably so it is difficult for a reader to know what he is writing about) should be aimed at the bringing of energy-flowing values as explanatory principles and standards of judgments into the Academy for the legitimation of living educational theories (Whitehead 2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In the eyes of Whitehead, [[radical constructivism]] is at the core of living educational theory research.

Barry was asked by the BERA sponsored authors to reflect on the nature of living educational theory (LET) because there existed no clear definition of LET in the literature. Barry was asked because he had successfully used LET in an innovative fashion, and was the first to clearly define LET as based in [[critical theory]] {{harv|Wink|2011}} which embraced [[transpersonal psychology]] through his earned 2012 PhD thesis at [[Nottingham Trent University]] Nottingham, UK. He proposed LET as a way of challenging the oppressive use of power using critical theory {{harv|Gorlewski|Gorlewski|Portfilio|2012}} in a need fulfilling way (Glasser 1998){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Barry proposed the following definition and approach to action research he calls living educational theory and his approach has been used as an action research method in undergraduate and graduate courses and research at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in Silicon Valley, California as well as by other researchers around the world.

Barry explained that living educational theory "[is] a critical and transformational approach to action research. It confronts the researcher to challenge the status quo of their educational practice and to answer the question, 'How can I improve that I'm doing?' Researchers who use this approach must be willing to recognize and assume responsibility for being a 'living contradiction' in their professional practice – thinking one way and acting in another. The mission of the LET action researcher is to overcome workplace norms and self – behavior which contradict the researcher's values and beliefs. The vision of the LET researcher is to make an original contribution to knowledge through generating an educational theory proven to improve the learning of people within a social learning space. The standard of judgment for theory validity is evidence of workplace reform, transformational growth of the researcher, and improved learning by the people researcher claimed to have influenced..." {{harv|Atkins|Wallace|2012| p=131}}.

Barry's LET approach to action research was heavily influenced by action researchers focused on emancipatory social change, collaboration, and liberation theology ([[#{{harvid|Barry|2012a}}|2012a]]). Prominent developers of LET, without whose work LET would most likely never had been developed by Barry, are notable action researchers, educators, and philosophers such as [[Martin Buber]]'s ([[#{{harvid|Buber|1970}}|1970]]) conception of 'I and Thou' and [[Krishnamurti]]'s (1953){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} liberation pedagogy emphasizing education as significant to leading a quality filled life; [[Paulo Freire]] (1998{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[#{{harvid|Freire|1970}}|1970]]) and his concept of participatory action research and the need to be politically aware; the work of Carr and Kremmis (1986){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Habermas]] (1992) and their concept and building critical educational knowledge; Professor Manheimer of UNC (1999){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and his challenge to his readers to enfold the past into the living present in order to become historical to oneself and then strive to linking life times with each other; Apple (1982){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Michel Foucault]] (1990){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the role of power and politics in education and Joe Kincheloe (2008){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, [[Henry Giroux]] (1997){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}, and [[Peter McLaren]] (1989){{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and their promotion of critical pedagogy.

Prof. Barry was the first Ph.D. researcher to successfully use living educational theory in conjunction with [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP), [[spiral dynamics]] and [[autoethnography]] (based on a [[multiple intelligences]] model which includes [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[emotional intelligence]] and embraces [[transpersonal]] knowing)  as valid methods of research working under the methodological umbrella of phenomenology and hermeneutics. His LET approach to Ph.D.level action research led to the unique use of fictional storytelling as a vehicle by which to replace the traditional literature review chapter in Ph.D. research but in a more rigorous and creative fashion. The process of [[storytelling]] allows the researcher to exercise their emotional intelligence in a superior manner than the traditional research literature review allows.

==Six cycles==

Living educational theory as defined and created by Barry is part of the curriculum of multiple courses at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] located in Silicon Valley, California in their credentialing program for teacher education. Barry's Living Educational Theory Action Research Method is based on a six step process&lt;ref&gt;(https://web.archive.org/web/20140310094005/http://www.ntu.edu/faculty-staff)&lt;/ref&gt; based on research questions that normally start from the format, " How can I influence the transformation of....?" or "How can I contribute to the improvement of...?" The research is dialectical in nature:

# I experience a crises in my sense of meaning when my values and beliefs as an educator/educational leader and/or learner are oppressed by my passive acceptance of the status quo and the use of oppressive power to change my identity. In essence, I experience narrative wreckage in my educational life (Thesis).
# I describe my contribution in promoting the [[status quo]] and my role in using oppressive power against others from both a [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] perspective to illuminate my living contradictions (Anti-thesis)
# I develop a solution to transform and improve myself, influence the transformation and improvement of the fellow human beings with whom I interact and the social and work places I share with people.
# I enact [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in the direction of the solution I developed from a [[critical theory]] perspective.
# I evaluate the pragmatic outcomes of the solution based on the Hallmarks of Learning {{harv|Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur|2005}} and the implications from a holistic psychological perspective including [[transpersonal psychology]].
# I modify my use of power, pedagogy, valid and reliable [[Educational assessment|assessment]], and leadership to maximize social justice, ethical processes and results, and improve performance and knowledge as a result of my emerging living educational theory (LET) (Synthesis). As an iterative process, I start the cycle again within reasonable time constraints.

A '''Meker–Fisher burner''', or '''Meker burner''', is a [[laboratory equipment|laboratory]] [[Gas burner|burner]] that produces multiple open gas [[flame]]s, used for heating, sterilization, and combustion. It is used when laboratory work requires a hotter flame than attainable using a [[Bunsen burner]], or used when a larger-diameter flame is desired, such as with an [[inoculation loop]] or in some glassblowing operations. The burner was introduced by French chemist Georges Méker in an article published in 1905.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;G. Meker. Nouveaux bruleurs de laboratoire et leur application au chauffage a temperature elevee. J. Phys. Theor. Appl., 1905, 4 (1), pp. 348–354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meker–Fisher burner heat output can be in excess of {{convert|12000|BTU|abbr=on|lk=on}} per hour (about 3.5 k[[Watt|W]]) using [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durhamgeo.com/testing/laboratory/ovens-bunsen.htm Durham Geo].&lt;/ref&gt; Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F|-2}} are achievable. Compared with a Bunsen burner, the lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider, and its top is covered with a plate [[mesh]], which separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, ensures uniform heating, and also preventing [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximal rate of air intake in a Bunsen burner. The flame burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or [[Teclu burner]]s.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Thinker close.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Philosophical quietists want to release man from deep perplexity that philosophical contemplation often causes.]]

'''Quietism''' in [[philosophy]] is an approach to the subject that sees the role of philosophy as broadly [[therapeutic approach|therapeutic]] or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virvidakis|first=Stelios|last2=Kindi|first2=Vasso|title=Quietism|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396577-0184|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396577-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; By re-formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to humanity's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Quietist philosophers==

By its very nature, quietism is not a [[List of schools of philosophy|philosophical school]] as understood in the traditional sense of a body of doctrines, but still it can be identified both by its [[methodology]], which focuses on [[language]] and the use of [[word]]s, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only [[pseudo-problem]]s.

[[Pyrrhonism]] represents perhaps the earliest example of an identifiably quietist position in the West. [[Sextus Empiricus]] regarded Pyrrhonism not as a nihilistic attack but rather as a form of philosophical therapy:

{{Quote|text=The causal principle of scepticism we say is the hope of becoming tranquil. Men of talent, troubled by the anomaly in things and puzzled as to which of them they should rather assent to, came to investigate what in things is true and what false, thinking that by deciding these issues they would become tranquil. The chief constitutive principle of scepticism is the claim that to every account an equal account is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold no beliefs.|sign=[[Sextus Empiricus]]|source=''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism|Outlines of Scepticism]]'', 12}}

Contemporary discussion of quietism can be traced back to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whose work greatly influenced the [[Ordinary language philosophy|Ordinary Language philosophers]]. One of the early 'ordinary language' works, [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'', attempted to demonstrate that [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behaviour. [[J. L. Austin]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'' took a similar approach to the problems of [[skepticism]] and the reliability of [[Perception|sense perception]], arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with [[empirical evidence]]. [[Norman Malcolm]], a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the [[philosophy of mind]]. More recently, the philosophers [[John McDowell]] and [[Richard Rorty]] have taken explicitly quietist positions.

'''''The Language of the Genes''''' ([[HarperCollins]], {{ISBN|0-00-255020-2}}) is a [[popular science]] [[book]] by [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] about [[genetics]] and [[evolution]].  It followed a 1991 series of [[Reith Lectures]] by Jones with the same title.&lt;ref name=Reith&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith/historic_audio/reith_historic.shtml BBC website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222084446/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith/historic_audio/reith_historic.shtml |date=2008-12-22 }} Historic Reith Lectures&lt;/ref&gt; The book introduces all different aspects of genetics and [[molecular biology]], and the new editions contain information about the frontiers of the field, such as the [[Human Genome Project]].  The first edition was published in 1993 and won the [[Rhône-Poulenc Prize]] (now known as the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/bookspage.asp?id=6372 Prizes for Science Books previous winners and shortlists], [[The Royal Society]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book is partly the result of Jones' regular use of a [[metaphor]] of [[nucleotide]]s as [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], [[codon]]s as [[word]]s and [[gene]]s as [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also reflecting Jones' short explanation of [[language]]'s role in [[human]] evolution.

A second revised and expanded edition ({{ISBN|0-006-55243-9}}) was published by [[Flamingo (imprint)|Flamingo]] on 18 September 2000.

The '''UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies (STS)''' is an academic department in [[University College London]], [[London]], England. It is part of UCL's Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences. The department offers academic training at both undergraduate and graduate (MSc and MPhil/PhD) levels.

The department received its current name in 1994. It had been the "Department of History and Philosophy of Science" from 1938 to 1994, and the "Department of History and Method of Science" from 1921 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Smeaton, William A. "History of science at University College London: 1919–47", ''[[The British Journal for the History of Science]]'', 30: 25–28, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

University College London was the first UK university to offer single honours undergraduate degrees in this interdisciplinary subject, launching its BSc in history and philosophy of science in 1993. Two related BSc degrees followed shortly thereafter. At UCL, science and technology studies (abbreviated "STS") includes three specialist research clusters: "history of science," "philosophy of science," and "science, culture, and democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/research|title=STS Research|website=www.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department offices are located in [[Gordon Square]], [[Bloomsbury]], London.

{{Women in society sidebar|science}}

Women have made significant contributions to [[science]] from the earliest times. Historians with an interest in [[gender]] and science have illuminated the scientific endeavors and accomplishments of women, the barriers they have faced, and the strategies implemented to have their work [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] and accepted in major scientific journals and other publications. The historical, critical and [[sociology|sociological]] study of these issues has become an academic discipline in its own right.

The involvement of [[Women in medicine|women in the field of medicine]] occurred in several early civilizations, and the study of [[natural philosophy]] in [[ancient Greece]] was open to women. Women contributed to the [[proto-science]] of [[alchemy]] in the first or second centuries AD. During the Middle Ages, [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. While the eleventh century saw the emergence of the [[medieval university|first universities]], women were, for the most part, excluded from university education.&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann. ''Women's History as Scientists''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, INC. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude to educating women in medical fields in Italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The first known woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies, was eighteenth-century Italian scientist, [[Laura Bassi]].

Although gender roles were largely defined in the eighteenth century, women experienced great advances in science. During the nineteenth century, women were excluded from most formal scientific education, but they began to be admitted into learned societies during this period. In the later nineteenth century, the rise of the [[women's college]] provided jobs for women scientists and opportunities for education. [[Marie Curie]], the first woman to receive a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel Prize recipient in 1911 (chemistry), both for her work on [[radioactive decay|radiation]]. Forty women have been awarded the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2010. 17 women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine.&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Awarded Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Cross-cultural perspectives===
In the 1970s and 1980s although many books and articles about women scientists were appearing, virtually all of the published sources ignored women of color and women outside of Europe and North America.  One of the few exceptions was Derek Richter's 1982 book about women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Richter, ''Women Scientists:The Road to Liberation'', Macmillan, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the [[Kovalevskaia Fund]] in 1985 and the [[Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World]] in 1993 gave more visibility to previously marginalized women scientists, but even today there is a dearth of information about current and historical women in science in developing countries.  According to [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Gender and science where science is on the margins," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 25, no 2 (2005), pp. 107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|
Most work on women scientists has focused on the personalities and scientific subcultures of Western Europe and North America, and historians of women in science have implicitly or explicitly assumed that the observations made for those
regions will hold true for the rest of the world.
}}
Koblitz has said that these generalizations about women in science often do not hold up cross-culturally.  For example,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Global perspectives," ''World Science Report 1996'', UNESCO, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{Quote|
A scientific or technical field that might be considered 'unwomanly' in one country in a given period may enjoy the participation of many women in a different historical period or in another country.  An example is engineering, which in many countries is considered the exclusive domain of men, especially in usually prestigious subfields such as electrical or mechanical engineering.  There are exceptions to this, however.  In the former Soviet Union all subspecialties of engineering had high percentages of women, and at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería of Nicaragua, women made up 70% of engineering students in 1990.

===Ancient history===
The involvement of [[Women in medicine|women in the field of medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Merit-Ptah]] ({{circa|2700 BC}}), described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest known female scientist named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]] (c. 1194–1184 BC). [[Agnodike]] was the first female physician to practice legally in fourth century BC [[Athens]].

The study of [[natural philosophy]] in [[ancient Greece]] was open to women.  Recorded examples include [[Aglaonike]], who predicted [[eclipse]]s; and [[Theano (mathematician)|Theano]], [[mathematician]] and physician, who was a pupil (possibly also wife) of [[Pythagoras]], and one of a school in [[Crotone]] founded by Pythagoras, which included many other women.&lt;ref name="four_thousand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/4000WS/timelist.shtml|title=Time ordered list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage in Pollux speaks about those who invented the process of coining money mentioning Pheidon and [[Hermodike II (Demodike II, Hermodice II, Damodice II)|Demodike from Cyme]], wife of the Phrygian king, Midas, and daughter of King Agamemnon of Cyme.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology'', 1983, University of California Press, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition recounts that a daughter of a certain Agamemnon, king of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Aeolian Cyme]], married a Phrygian king called Midas.&lt;ref name="Clay et al"&gt;Jenny Strauss Clay, Irad Malkin, Yannis Z. Tzifopoulos eds., ''Panhellenes at Methone: Graphê in Late Geometric and Protoarchaic Methone'', Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2017, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; This link may have facilitated the Greeks "borrowing" their alphabet from the Phrygians because the Phrygian letter shapes are closest to the inscriptions from Aeolis.&lt;ref name="Clay et al" /&gt;

During the period of the Babylonian civilization, around 1200 B.C., two perfumeresses named [[Tapputi|Tapputi-Belatekallim]] and -ninu (first half of her name lost) were able to obtain the essences from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. If we are to argue chemistry as the use of chemical equipment and processes, then we can identify these two women as the first chemists. Even during the time of the Egyptian dynasty, women were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good number of women have been recorded to have made major contributions to [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt; Many of which lived in [[Alexandria]] around the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, where the [[gnostic]] tradition led to female contributions being valued. The most famous of the women alchemist, [[Mary the Jewess]], is credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the [[double boiler]] (''bain-marie''); the improvement or creation of distillation equipment of that time.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reframing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu37we/uu37we08.htm|title=Reframing the question|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such distillation equipment were called ''kerotakis'' (simple still) and the ''tribikos'' (a complex distillation device).&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt;

[[Hypatia of Alexandria]] (c. 350–415 AD), daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria]], was a well-known teacher at the Neoplatonic School in Alexandria teaching astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia#ref1178406|title=Hypatia {{!}} mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 3-4"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is recognized to be the first known woman mathematician in history through her major contributions to mathematics.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 3-4" /&gt; Hypatia is credited with writing three major treatises on [[geometry]], [[algebra]] and [[astronomy]]; as well as the invention of a [[hydrometer]], an [[astrolabe]], and an instrument for [[distillation|distilling]] [[water (molecule)|water]].&lt;ref name="four_thousand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deakin|first=Michael A.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|thumb|Hildegard of Bingen]]
The early parts of the European [[Middle Ages]], also known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], were marked by the decline [[decline of the Roman Empire|of the Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin West]] was left with great difficulties that affected the continent's intellectual production dramatically. Although nature was still seen as a system that could be comprehended in the light of reason, there was little innovative scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="SocietalCollapse"&gt;The End of the Classical World, (Lecture 12), in Lawrence M. Principe (2002) History of Science: Antiquity to 1700. Teaching Company, Course No. 1200&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic world deserves credit for preserving scientific advancements. Arabic scholars produced original scholarly work and generated copies of manuscripts from [[Classical antiquity|Classical periods]].&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C.|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Christianity underwent a period of resurgence, and Western civilization was bolstered as a result. This phenomenon was, in part, due to monasteries and nunneries that nurtured the skills of reading and writing, and the monks and nuns who collected and copied important writings produced by scholars of the past.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.[[File:Medieval female physician.jpg|thumb|Female physician caring for a patient]]

As it mentioned before, [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women during this period, for the monasteries and nunneries encourage the skills of reading and writing, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt; An example is the German [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179 A.D), a famous philosopher and botanists, known for her prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including medicine, [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151–58).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html Hildegard von Bingen (Sabina Flanagan)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous German abbess was [[Hrotsvitha|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] (935–1000 A.D.)&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt; that also helped encourage women to be intellectual. However, with the growth in number and power of nunneries, the all-male clerical hierarchy was not welcomed toward it, and thus it stirred up conflict by having backlash against women's advancement. That impacted many religious orders closed on women and disbanded their nunneries, and overall excluding women from the ability to learn to read and write. With that, the world of science became closed off to women, limiting women's influence in science.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt;

Entering the 11th century, the [[medieval university|first universities]] emerged. Women were, for the most part, excluded from university education.&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt; However, there were some exceptions. The Italian [[University of Bologna]], for example, allowed women to attend lectures from its inception, in 1088.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. S.|last=Edwards|title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_XI,_2002/edwards_j.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude to educating women in medical fields in Italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The physician, [[Trotula of Salerno|Trotula di Ruggiero]], is supposed to have held a chair at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Medical School of Salerno]] in the 11th century, where she taught many noble Italian women, a group sometimes referred to as the "ladies of Salerno".&lt;ref name="reframing" /&gt; Several influential texts on women's medicine, dealing with [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], among other topics, are also often attributed to Trotula.

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Howard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22&amp;sig=8woi3s53ZMsEXfRjee9uswZdUHI The Hidden Giants], p. 35, (Lulu.com; 2006) (Retrieved 22 August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackler"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/dorotea_bucca.php Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A.

Despite the success of some women, cultural biases affecting their education and participation in science were prominent in the Middle Ages. For example, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], a Christian scholar, wrote, referring to women, "She is mentally incapable of holding a position of authority."&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt;

===Scientific Revolution (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries)===
[[File:Margbig.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Margaret Cavendish]]]]

[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle upon Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]], a seventeenth-century aristocrat, took part in some of the most important scientific debates of that time. She was however, not inducted into the English [[Royal Society]], although she was once allowed to attend a meeting. She wrote a number of works on scientific matters, including ''Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (1666)'' and ''Grounds of Natural Philosophy''. In these works she was especially critical of the growing belief that humans, through science, were the masters of nature. The 1666 work attempted to heighten female interest in science. The observations provided a critique of the experimental science of Bacon and criticized microscopes as imperfect machines.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann. ''Women's History as Scientists''. (California: 2003), pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the tradition of female participation in craft production enabled some women to become involved in observational science, especially [[astronomy]]. Between 1650 and 1710, women were 14% of German astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, Jackson J. Western Civilization, Volume B: 1300–1815. [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-495-50289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous female astronomer in Germany was [[Maria Winkelmann]]. She was educated by her father and uncle and received training in astronomy from a nearby self-taught astronomer. Her chance to be a practising astronomer came when she married [[Gottfried Kirch]], Prussia's foremost astronomer. She became his assistant at the [[astronomical observatory]] operated in Berlin by the [[Academy of Science]]. She made original contributions, including the discovery of a comet. When her husband died, Winkelmann applied for a position as assistant astronomer at the Berlin Academy – for which she had experience. As a woman – with no university degree – she was denied the post. Members of the Berlin Academy feared that they would establish a bad example by hiring a woman. "Mouths would gape", they said.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa (1992). "Maria Winkelmann at the Berlin Academy", in Gendered domains: rethinking public and private in women's history : essays from the Seventh [[Berkshire Conference on the History of Women]]. (Ithaca: 1992). 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winkelmann's problems with the Berlin Academy reflect the obstacles women faced in being accepted in scientific work, which was considered to be chiefly for men. No woman was invited to either the [[Royal Society]] of London nor the [[French Academy of Sciences]] until the twentieth century. Most people in the seventeenth century viewed a life devoted to any kind of scholarship as being at odds with the domestic duties women were expected to perform.

A founder of modern botany and zoology, the German [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] (1647–1717), spent her life investigating nature. When she was thirteen, Sibylla began growing caterpillars and studying their metamorphosis into butterflies. She kept a "Study Book" which recorded her investigations into natural philosophy. In her first publication, ''The New Book of Flowers'', she used imagery to catalog the lives of plants and insects. After her husband died, and her brief stint of living in [[Siewert]], she and her daughter journeyed to [[Paramaribo]] for two years to observe insects, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/apr/09/the-flowering-genius-of-maria-sibylla-merian/|title=The Flowering Genius of Maria Sibylla Merian|author=Ingrid D.

Overall, the [[Scientific Revolution]] did little to change people's ideas about the nature of women - more specifically - their capacity to contribute to science just as men do. According to Jackson Spielvogel, 'Male scientists used the new science to spread the view that women were by nature inferior and subordinate to men and suited to play a domestic role as nurturing mothers. The widespread distribution of books ensured the continuation of these ideas'.&lt;ref name=Jackson2014&gt;"book" in Spielvogel, Jackson (2014) Western Civilisation.

===Eighteenth century===
[[File:Laura_Bassi.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Laura Bassi]], the first woman to earn a professorship in physics at a university in Europe]]
Although women excelled in many scientific areas during the eighteenth century, they were discouraged from learning about plant reproduction. [[Carl Linnaeus]]' system of plant classification based on sexual characteristics drew attention to botanical licentiousness, and people feared that women would learn immoral lessons from nature's example. Women were often depicted as both innately emotional and incapable of objective reasoning, or as natural mothers reproducing a natural, moral society.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Ruth, Women in Science: A Social and Cultural History. (London and New York: 2007), pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth century was characterized by three divergent views towards woman: that women were mentally and socially inferior to men, that they were equal but different, and that women were potentially equal in both mental ability and contribution to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tNlvK-_t9IC|title=Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While individuals such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] believed women's roles were confined to motherhood and service to their male partners, the Enlightenment was a period in which women experienced expanded roles in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann. ''Women's History as Scientists''. (California: 2003), 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of salon culture in Europe brought philosophers and their conversation to an intimate setting where men and women met to discuss contemporary political, social, and scientific topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/acton/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1043408&amp;jid=MIH&amp;volumeId=4&amp;issuID=02&amp;=104304|title=Redirect support|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Jean-Jacques Rousseau attacked women-dominated salons as producing ‘effeminate men’ that stifled serious discourse, salons were characterized in this era by the mixing of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Ruth, Women in Science: A Social and Cultural History.

In 1741-42 [[Charlotta Frölich]] became the first woman to be published by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] with three books in agricultural science. In 1748 [[Eva Ekeblad]] became the first woman inducted into that academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Flower Hunters|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yDC7gu-sCMsC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=1748+Eva+Ekeblad#v=onepage&amp;q=1748%20Eva%20Ekeblad&amp;f=false/|isbn=9780192807182|author1=Gribbin|first1=Mary|last2=Gribbin|first2=John|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1746 Ekeblad had written to the academy about her discoveries of how to make flour and alcohol out of [[potatoes]].&lt;ref name="riksarkivet.se" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ljus från Sverige" /&gt; Potatoes had been introduced into Sweden in 1658, but had been cultivated only in the greenhouses of the aristocracy.

[[Émilie du Châtelet]], a close friend of [[Voltaire]], was the first scientist to appreciate the significance of [[kinetic energy]], as opposed to [[momentum]]. She repeated and described the importance of an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] showing the impact of falling objects is proportional not to their velocity, but to the velocity squared. This understanding is considered to have made a profound contribution to [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinsser Judith P. ''Emilie Du Chatelet: Daring Genius of the Enlightenment.'' Penguin paperback, November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 she completed the French translation of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (the ''Principia''), including her derivation of the notion of [[conservation of energy]] from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, her translation and commentary of the ''Principia'' contributed to the completion of the [[scientific revolution]] in France and to its acceptance in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Calculus Early Transcendental Functions|last=Larson, Hostetler, Edwards|publisher=Richard Stratton|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-87918-2|location=U.S.A|pages=344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]] and her husband [[Antoine Lavoisier]] rebuilt the field of [[chemistry]], which had its roots in [[alchemy]] and at the time was a convoluted science dominated by [[George Stahl]]’s theory of [[phlogiston]]. Paulze accompanied Lavoisier in his lab, making entries into lab notebooks and sketching diagrams of his experimental designs. The training she had received allowed her to accurately and precisely draw experimental apparatuses, which ultimately helped many of Lavoisier's contemporaries to understand his methods and results. Paulze translated various works about phlogiston into French. One of her most important translation was that of [[Richard Kirwan]]'s ''Essay on Phlogiston and the Constitution of Acids'', which she both translated and critiqued, adding footnotes as she went along and pointing out errors in the chemistry made throughout the paper.&lt;ref name=Haines&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Catharine M.C.|title=International Women in Science a Biographical Dictionary to 1950.|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781576075593|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulze was instrumental in the 1789 publication of Lavoisier's ''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry'', which presented a unified view of chemistry as a field. This work proved pivotal in the progression of chemistry, as it presented the idea of conservation of mass as well as a list of elements and a new system for chemical nomenclature. She also kept strict records of the procedures followed, lending validity to the findings Lavoisier published.

The astronomer [[Caroline Herschel]] was born in Hanover but moved to England where she acted as an assistant to her brother, [[William Herschel]]. Throughout her writings, she repeatedly made it clear that she desired to earn an independent wage and be able to support herself. When the crown began paying her for her assistance to her brother in 1787, she became the first woman to do so at a time when even men rarely received wages for scientific enterprises—to receive a salary for services to science.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Brock, Claire.

===Early nineteenth century===
Science remained a largely amateur profession during the early part of the nineteenth century. Women's contributions were limited by their exclusion from most formal scientific education, but began to be recognized by admittance into learned societies during this period.

Scottish scientist [[Mary Fairfax Somerville]] carried out experiments in [[magnetism]], presenting a paper entitled 'The Magnetic Properties of the Violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum' to the [[Royal Society]] in 1826, the second woman to do so. She also wrote several mathematical, astronomical, physical and geographical texts, and was a strong advocate for women's education. In 1835, she and [[Caroline Herschel]] were the first two women elected as Honorary Members of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreyer|first1=ed. by J. L.

Ausg.] London, Wheldon &amp; Wesley, 1923.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English mathematician [[Ada Lovelace|Ada, Lady Lovelace]], a pupil of Somerville, corresponded with [[Charles Babbage]] about applications for his [[analytical engine]]. In her notes (1842–3) appended to her translation of [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s article on the engine, she foresaw wide applications for it as a general-purpose computer, including composing music. She has been credited as writing the first computer program, though this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0092j0x|title=Ada Lovelace, In Our Time – BBC Radio 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, institutes for "higher" education of women (''Höhere Töchterschule'', in some regions called ''Lyzeum'') were founded at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Claus-Hinrich Offen; ''Schule in einer hanseatischen Bürgergesellschaft: zur Sozialgeschichte des niederen Schulwesens in Lübeck (1800–1866)'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Deaconess Institute]] at [[Kaiserswerth]] was established in 1836 to instruct women in [[nursing]]. [[Elizabeth Fry]] visited the institute in 1840 and was inspired to found the [[London Institute of Nursing]], and [[Florence Nightingale]] studied there in 1851.&lt;ref name="CUP"&gt;''The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine'', R. Porter (editor), Cambridge University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Maria Mitchell]] made her name by discovering a comet in 1847, but also contributed calculations to the Nautical Almanac produced by the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. She became the first woman member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1848 and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1850.

Other notable female scientists during this period include:&lt;ref name="four_thousand" /&gt;
* in Britain, [[Mary Anning]] (paleontologist), [[Anna Atkins]] (botanist), [[Janet Taylor]] (astronomer)
* in France, [[Sophie Germain|Marie-Sophie Germain]] (mathematician), [[Jeanne Villepreux-Power]] (marine biologist)

===Late 19th century in western Europe===
The latter part of the 19th century saw a rise in educational opportunities for women. Schools aiming to provide education for girls similar to that afforded to boys were founded in the UK, including the [[North London Collegiate School]] (1850), [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] (1853) and the [[Girls' Day School Trust|Girls' Public Day School Trust]] schools (from 1872). The first UK women's university college, [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]], was founded in 1869, and others soon followed: [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] (1871) and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] (1879).

The [[Crimean War]] (1854–6) contributed to establishing [[nursing]] as a profession, making [[Florence Nightingale]] a household name. A public subscription allowed Nightingale to establish a school of nursing in London in 1860, and schools following her principles were established throughout the UK.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt; Nightingale was also a pioneer in [[public health]] as well as a statistician.

[[James Barry (surgeon)|James Barry]] became the first British woman to gain a medical qualification in 1812, passing as a man. [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] was the first openly female Briton to qualify medically, in 1865. With [[Sophia Jex-Blake]], American [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]] and others, Garret Anderson founded the first UK medical school to train women, the [[London School of Medicine for Women]], in 1874.

[[File: Annie Scott Dill Maunder.jpg|thumb|Annie Scott Dill Maunder]]
[[Annie Scott Dill Maunder]] was a pioneer in astronomical photography, especially of [[sunspot]]s. A mathematics graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was first hired (in 1890) to be an assistant to [[Edward Walter Maunder]], discoverer of the [[Maunder Minimum]], the head of the solar department at [[Greenwich Observatory]]. They worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography. They married in 1895. Annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyse the years of sunspot data that Maunder had been collecting at Greenwich. She also designed a small, portable wide-angle camera with a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} lens. In 1898, the Maunders traveled to India, where Annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse. By analysing the Cambridge records for both sunspots and [[geomagnetic storm]], they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space, as [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] had declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Clark|title=The Sun Kings – The Unexpected Tragedy of Richard Carrington and the Tale of How Modern Astronomy Began|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|pages=140–146, 154–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Prussia]] women could go to university from 1894 and were allowed to receive a PhD. In 1908 all remaining restrictions for women were terminated.

[[Alphonse Rebière]] published a book in 1897, in France, entitled ''Les Femmes dans la science'' (Women in Science) which listed the contributions and publications of women in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes dans la science; notes recueillies par A. Rebière|url=https://archive.org/details/lesfemmesdanslas00rebiuoft|website=archive.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late nineteenth century Russians===
In the second half of the 19th century a large proportion of the most successful women in the STEM fields were Russians.  Although many women received advanced training in medicine in the 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, "Women medical students in Russia, 1872–1882," ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 12, No. 3 (1979), pp. 394-415.&lt;/ref&gt; in other fields women were barred and had to go to western Europe—mainly Switzerland—in order to pursue scientific studies.  In her book about these "women of the [eighteen] sixties" (шестидесятницы), as they were called, [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] writes:&lt;ref name="ruswomen"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}
{{Quote|
To a large extent, women's higher education in continental Europe was pioneered by this first generation of Russian women.  They were the first students in Zürich, Heidelberg, Leipzig, and elsewhere.  Theirs were the first doctorates in medicine, chemistry, mathematics, and biology.
}}
Among the successful scientists were [[Nadezhda Suslova]] (1843–1918), the first woman in the world to obtain a medical doctorate fully equivalent to men's degrees; [[Maria Bokova-Sechenova]] (1839–1929), a pioneer of women's medical education who received two doctoral degrees, one in medicine in Zürich and one in physiology in Vienna; [[Iulia Lermontova]] (1846–1919), the first woman in the world to receive a doctoral degree in chemistry; the marine biologist [[Sofia Pereiaslavtseva]] (1849–1903), director of the Sevastopol Biological Station and winner of the Kessler Prize of the Russian Society of Natural Scientists;  and the mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaia]] (1850–1891), the first woman in 19th century Europe to receive a doctorate in mathematics and the first to become a university professor in any field.&lt;ref name="ruswomen"/&gt;

===Late nineteenth century in the United States===
{{See also|Timeline of women in science in the United States}}
In the later nineteenth century the rise of the [[women's college]] provided jobs for women scientists, and opportunities for education. Women's colleges produced a disproportionate number of women who went on for PhDs in science. Many [[coeducation]]al colleges and universities also opened or started to admit women during this period; such institutions included just over 3000 women in 1875, by 1900 numbered almost 20,000.&lt;ref name="CWP" /&gt;

An example is [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], who became the first certified female doctor in the US when she graduated from [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Geneva Medical College]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_35.html|title=Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her sister, [[Emily Blackwell]], and [[Marie Zakrzewska]], Blackwell founded the [[New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] in 1857 and the first women's medical college in 1868, providing both training and clinical experience for women doctors. She also published several books on medical education for women.

In 1876, Elizabeth Bragg became the first woman to graduate with a [[civil engineering]] degree in the United States, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|title=WEP Milestones|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/bpi/jmep/milestones.html|work=Berkeley Engineering|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], the first woman to win a [[Nobel prize]] in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel prize winner in 1911 (chemistry), both for her work on [[radioactive decay|radiation]]. She was the first person to win two Nobel prizes, a feat accomplished by only three others since then.

Alice Perry is understood to be the first woman to graduate with a degree in civil engineering in the then [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], in 1906 at [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Perry|url=http://www.realizedvision.com/ap.php|publisher=[[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lise Meitner]] played a major role in the discovery of nuclear fission. As head of the physics section at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin she collaborated closely with the head of chemistry [[Otto Hahn]] on atomic physics until forced to flee Berlin in 1938. In 1939, in collaboration with her nephew [[Otto Frisch]], Meitner derived the theoretical explanation for an experiment performed by Hahn and [[Fritz Strassman]] in Berlin, thereby demonstrating the occurrence of [[nuclear fission]]. The possibility that Fermi's bombardment of uranium with neutrons in 1934 had instead produced fission by breaking up the nucleus into lighter elements, had actually first been raised in print in 1934, by chemist [[Ida Noddack]] (co-discover of the element [[rhenium]]), but this suggestion had been ignored at the time, as no group made a concerted effort to find any of these light radioactive fission products.

[[Maria Montessori]] was the first woman in Southern Europe to qualify as a physician.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} She developed an interest in the diseases of children and believed in the necessity of educating those recognized to be ineducable. In the case of the latter she argued for the development of training for teachers along [[Froebelian]] lines and developed the principle that was also to inform [[Montessori education|her general educational program]], which is the first the education of the senses, then the education of the intellect. Montessori introduced a teaching program that allowed defective children to read and write. She sought to teach skills not by having children repeatedly try it, but by developing exercises that prepare them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Phyllis Povell|title=Montessori Comes to America: The Leadership of Maria Montessori and Nancy McCormick Rambusch|location=California, US|publisher=UPA|page=170|date=2009|isbn=978-0-7618-4928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Noether]] revolutionized abstract algebra, filled in gaps in relativity, and was responsible for a critical theorem about conserved quantities in physics. One notes that the [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] under a group of transformations. On 16 July 1918, before a scientific organization in [[Göttingen]], [[Felix Klein]] read a paper written by [[Emmy Noether]], because she was not allowed to present the paper herself. In particular, in what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], this paper identified the conditions under which the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmy Noether (1918c) "Invariante Variationsprobleme" ''Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften der Göttingen'', 235–257. Presented by Felix Klein 16 July 1918. Final printed version submitted September 1918. Paper denoted 1918c, in a Bibliography of Noether's work, pp. 173–182 of ''Emmy Noether in Bryn Mawr: Proceedings of a symposium sponsored by the Association for women in mathematics, in honor of Emmy Noether's 100th birthday'' (1983, Bhama Srinivasan and Judith Sally, eds.) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|0-387-90838-2}}. Biographical information on Noether's life can be found on pp. 133–137 "Emmy Noether in Erlangen and Göttingen", and on pp. 139–146 "Emmy Noether in Bryn Mawr".&lt;/ref&gt; Noether's papers made the requirements for the conservation laws precise. Among mathematicians, Noether is best known for her fundamental contributions to abstract algebra, where the adjective [[noetherian (disambiguation)|noetherian]] is nowadays commonly used on many sorts of objects.

[[Mary Cartwright]] was a British mathematician who was the first to analyze a dynamical system with chaos.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Inge Lehmann]], a Danish [[seismologist]], first suggested in 1936 that inside the Earth's molten core there may be a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/resource-collections/earth-inside-and-out/inge-lehmann-discoverer-of-the-earth-s-inner-core|title=Inge Lehmann: Discoverer of the Earth's Inner Core|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as [[Margaret Fountaine]] continued to contribute detailed observations and illustrations in botany, entomology, and related observational fields. [[Joan Beauchamp Procter]], an outstanding herpetologist, was the first woman Curator of Reptiles for the [[Zoological Society of London]] at [[London Zoo]].

[[Florence R. Sabin|Florence Sabin]] was an [[United States|American]] medical scientist.

====United States before World War II====
{{See also|Timeline of women in science in the United States}}

Women moved into science in significant numbers by 1900, helped by the women's colleges and by opportunities at some of the new universities. Margaret Rossiter's books ''Women Scientists in America: Struggles and Strategies to 1940'' and ''Women Scientists in America: Before Affirmative Action 1940–1972'' provide an overview of this period, stressing the opportunities women found in separate women's work in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossiter|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossiter|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]]]]
In 1892, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] called for the "christening of a new science" – "[[oekology]]" (ecology) in a Boston lecture. This new science included the study of "consumer nutrition" and environmental education. This interdisciplinary branch of science was later specialized into what is currently known as ecology, while the consumer nutrition focus split off and was eventually relabeled as [[home economics]].,&lt;ref&gt;Kass-Simon, G. and Farnes, Patricia. ''Women of Science: Righting the Record''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Robert. ''Ellen Swallow: The Woman Who Founded Ecology''. Chicago: Follett. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; which provided another avenue for women to study science. Richards helped to form the [[American Home Economics Association]], which published a journal, the ''[[Journal of Home Economics]]'', and hosted conferences. Home economics departments were formed at many colleges, especially at land grant institutions. In her work at MIT, Ellen Richards also introduced the first biology course in its history as well as the focus area of sanitary engineering.

Women also found opportunities in [[botany]] and [[embryology]]. In [[psychology]], women earned doctorates but were encouraged to specialize in educational and [[child psychology]] and to take jobs in clinical settings, such as hospitals and social welfare agencies.

In 1901, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] first noticed that it was a star's temperature that was the principal distinguishing feature among different spectra.{{Dubious|reason=her bio suggests that she decided to categorize by Balmer lines and that it was only later was it realized that this corresponded to temperature.|date=March 2016}} This led to re-ordering of the ABC types by temperature instead of hydrogen absorption-line strength. Due to Cannon's work, most of the then-existing classes of stars were thrown out as redundant. Afterward, astronomy was left with the seven [[Stellar classification|primary classes]] recognized today, in order: O, B, A, F, G, K, M;&lt;ref name="Pogge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to Stars, Galaxies, &amp; the Universe |first=Richard|last=Pogge|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit1/sptypes.html |date=8 January 2006 |publisher=Ohio State University Department of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has since been extended.

[[File:Leavitt henrietta b1.jpg|thumb|160px|alt=Woman sitting at desk writing, with short hair, long-sleeved white blouse and vest|Henrietta Swan Leavitt made fundamental contributions to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamblin |first=Jacob Darwin |title=Science in the early twentieth century: an encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mpiZRAiE0JwC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=Leavitt+california+benjamin+leavitt#PPA181,M1 |pages=181–184 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-85109-665-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] first published her study of variable stars in 1908. This discovery became known as the "period-luminosity relationship" of [[Cepheid variable]]s.&lt;ref name="Malatesta"&gt;{{cite web |title=Delta Cephei |first=Kerri|last=Malatesta|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep |date=16 July 2010 |publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our picture of the universe was changed forever, largely because of Leavitt's discovery.

The accomplishments of [[Edwin Hubble]], renowned American astronomer, were made possible by Leavitt's groundbreaking research and Leavitt's Law. "If Henrietta Leavitt had provided the key to determine the size of the cosmos, then it was Edwin Powell Hubble who inserted it in the lock and provided the observations that allowed it to be turned", wrote David H. and Matthew D.H. Clark in their book ''Measuring the Cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Measuring the Cosmos: How Scientists Discovered the Dimensions of the Universe |author1=David H. Clark |author2=Matthew D.H.

Hubble often said that Leavitt deserved the Nobel for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneminuteastronomer.com/2009/11/19/mile-markers-galaxies |author=&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/Cool-Astronomy/Blogs/One-Minute-Astronomer Ventrudo, Brian]&lt;/span&gt; |title=Mile Markers to the Galaxies |date=19 November 2009 |work=One-Minute Astronomer |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] of the Swedish Academy of Sciences had begun paperwork on her nomination in 1924, only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe |last=Singh|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Singh |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4iAsRemPRJkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+bang+the+origin+of+the+universe+simon+singh#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-00-716221-9 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Nobel prize cannot be awarded posthumously).

In 1925, Harvard graduate student [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] demonstrated for the first time from existing evidence on the spectra of stars that stars were made up almost exclusively of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], one of the most fundamental theories in stellar [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref name="Pogge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malatesta" /&gt;

Canadian born [[Maud Menten]] worked in the US and Germany.  Her most famous work was on enzyme kinetics together with [[Leonor Michaelis]], based on earlier findings of [[Victor Henri]].  This resulted in the [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten]] equations. Menten also invented the azo-dye coupling reaction for [[alkaline phosphatase]], which is still used in histochemistry. She characterised bacterial toxins from ''B. paratyphosus'', ''Streptococcus scarlatina'' and ''[[Salmonella]] ssp.'', and conducted the first [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation of proteins in 1944. She worked on the properties of [[hemoglobin]], regulation of [[blood sugar]] level, and kidney function.

World War II brought some new opportunities. The [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], under [[Vannevar Bush]], began in 1941 to keep a registry of men and women trained in the sciences. Because there was a shortage of workers, some women were able to work in jobs they might not otherwise have accessed. Many women worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] or on scientific projects for the United States military services. Women who worked on the Manhattan Project included [[Leona Woods]] Marshall, [[Katharine Way]], and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]].

Women in other disciplines looked for ways to apply their expertise to the war effort. Three nutritionists, [[Lydia Roberts|Lydia J. Roberts]], [[Hazel Stiebeling|Hazel K. Stiebeling]], and [[Helen S. Mitchell]], developed the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] in 1941 to help military and civilian groups make plans for group feeding situations. The RDAs proved necessary, especially, once foods began to be [[Rationing|rationed]]. [[Rachel Carson]] worked for the United States [[Bureau of Fisheries]], writing brochures to encourage Americans to consume a wider variety of fish and seafood. She also contributed to research to assist the Navy in developing techniques and equipment for submarine detection.

Women in psychology formed the [[National Council of Women Psychologists]], which organized projects related to the war effort. The NCWP elected [[Florence Laura Goodenough]] president. In the social sciences, several women contributed to the [[Japanese Evacuation and Resettlement Study]], based at the [[University of California]]. This study was led by sociologist [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]], who directed the project and synthesized information from her informants, mostly graduate students in anthropology. These included [[Tamie Tsuchiyama]], the only [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]] woman to contribute to the study, and [[Rosalie Hankey Wax]].

In the [[United States Navy]], female scientists conducted a wide range of research. [[Mary Sears (oceanographer)|Mary Sears]], a [[Planktology|planktonologist]], researched military oceanographic techniques as head of the Hydgrographic Office's Oceanographic Unit. [[Florence van Straten]], a chemist, worked as an aerological engineer. She studied the effects of weather on military combat. [[Grace Hopper]], a mathematician, became one of the first [[computer programmers]] for the [[Harvard Mark I|Mark I]] computer. [[Mina Spiegel Rees]], also a mathematician, was the chief technical aide for the Applied Mathematics Panel of the [[National Defense Research Committee]].

[[Gerty Cori]] was a biochemist who discovered the mechanism by which glycogen, a derivative of glucose, is transformed in the muscles to form lactic acid, and is later reformed as a way to store energy. For this discovery she and her colleagues were awarded the Nobel prize in 1947, making her the third woman and the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. She was the first woman ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Cori is among several scientists whose works are commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Women Subjects on United States Postage Stamps |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/women-stamp-subjects.pdf |page=6 |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nina Byers]] notes that before 1976, fundamental contributions of women to physics were rarely acknowledged. Women worked unpaid or in positions lacking the status they deserved. That imbalance is gradually being redressed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In the early 1980s, Margaret Rossiter presented two concepts for understanding the statistics behind women in science as well as the disadvantages women continued to suffer. She coined the terms "hierarchical segregation" and "territorial segregation." The former term describes the phenomenon in which the further one goes up the chain of command in the field, the smaller the presence of women. The latter describes the phenomenon in which women "cluster in scientific disciplines."&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-00544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}}

A recent book titled ''Athena Unbound'' provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in science from early childhood interest, through university, graduate school and the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that "Women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Etzkowitz|Kemelgor|Uzzi|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] were set up in 1998, with prizes alternating each year between the materials science and life sciences. One award is given for each geographical region of Africa and the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America. By 2017, these awards had recognised almost 100 laureates from 30 countries.  Two of the laureates have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, [[Ada Yonath]] (2008) and [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] (2009). Fifteen promising young researchers also receive an International Rising Talent fellowship each year within this programme.

==Statistics==
{{globalize/US|section|date=April 2013}}

Statistics are used to indicate disadvantages faced by women in science, and also to track positive changes of employment opportunities and incomes for women in science.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|33}}

=== Situation in the 1990s ===
Women appear to do less well than men (in terms of degree, rank, and salary) in the fields that have been traditionally dominated by women, such as [[nursing]]. In 1991 women attributed 91% of the [[PhD]]s in nursing, and men held 4% of full professorships in nursing{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. In the field of [[psychology]], where women earn the majority of PhDs, women do not fill the majority of high rank positions in that field.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Women's lower salaries in the scientific community are also reflected in statistics. According to the data provided in 1993, the median salaries of female scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees were 20% less than men.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|35}}{{Update inline|date=March 2016}} This data can be explained{{who|date=April 2013}} as there was less participation of women in high rank scientific fields/positions and a female majority in low-paid fields/positions. However, even with men and women in the same scientific community field, women are typically paid 15–17% less than men{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. In addition to the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]], there were also salary differences between ethnicity: [[African-American]] women with more years of experiences earn 3.4% less than [[European-American]] women with similar skills, while Asian women engineers out-earn both Africans and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger [2001], p. 37, citing {{Cite journal|publisher=NSF|title=Women, Minorities|date=1996|pages=72–74}}, {{Cite journal|author=Edward Silverman|title=New NSF Report on Salaries of Ph.D.'s Reveals Gender Gaps in All Categories|work=Scientist |issue=5|date= 19 August 1991|volume=20}} and {{Cite journal|author=Edward Silverman|title=NSF's Ph.D. Salary Survey Finds Minorities Earn Less than Whites|work=Scientist|issue=5 |date= 16 September 1991|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=these figures are from the early 1990s|date=March 2016}}

Women are also under-represented in the sciences as compared to their numbers in the overall working population. Within 11% of African-American women in the workforce, 3% are employed as scientists and engineers.{{Clarify|3% of what? How is this relevant? I suspect this entire paragraph needs to be re-written or removed.|date=March 2016}} [[Hispanic]]s made up 8% of the total workers in the US, 3% of that number are scientists and engineers. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] participation cannot be statistically measured.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Women tend to earn less than men in almost all industries, including government and academia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Women are less likely to be hired in highest-paid positions{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed{{who|date=April 2013}} to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, nearly as much as their male peers.{{update inline|date=March 2016}} In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% as much as their male counterparts (in the 1970s they made 59% as much as their male counterparts).&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|33–37}}{{update inline|date=March 2016}}

Claudia Goldin, Harvard concludes in ''A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter'' – "The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1257/aer.104.4.1091|title=A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter†|journal=American Economic Review|volume=104|issue=4|pages=1091–1119|year=2014|last1=Goldin|first1=Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on women's participation in the "hard" sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]] speaks of the "leaky pipeline" model, in which the proportion of women "on track" to potentially becoming top scientists fall off at every step of the way, from getting interested in science and maths in elementary school, through doctorate, postdoctoral, and career steps.  The leaky pipeline also applies in other fields.  In [[biology]], for instance, women in the United States have been getting [[Master's degree|Masters]] degrees in the same numbers as men for two decades, yet fewer women get [[PhD]]s; and the numbers of women [[principal investigator]]s have not risen.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Luckenbill-Edds, "The 'Leaky Pipeline:' Has It Been Fixed?",''The American Society for Cell Biology'' 2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (1 November 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

What may be the cause of this "leaky pipeline" of women in the sciences?{{tone inline|date=March 2016}} It is important to look at factors outside of academia that are occurring in women's lives at the same time they are pursuing their continued education and career search.  The most outstanding factor that is occurring at this crucial time is family formation. As women are continuing their academic careers, they are also stepping into their new role as a wife and mother.  These traditionally require at large time commitment and presence outside work.  These new commitments do not fare well for the person looking to attain tenure. That is why women entering the family formation period of their life are 35% less likely to pursue tenure positions after receiving their PhD's than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staying Competitive|url = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/report/2009/11/10/6979/staying-competitive/|website = name|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, women occupied over half the places in science-related higher education courses (science, medicine, maths, computer science and engineering) in 2004/5.&lt;ref name="HESA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hesa.ac.uk/holisdocs/pubinfo/student/subject0405.htm |title=Table 2e – All HE students by level of study, subject of study(#5), domicile and gender 2004/05 |date=9 March 2007

In the US, women with science or engineering doctoral degrees were predominantly employed in the education sector in 2001, with substantially fewer employed in business or industry than men.&lt;ref name="hahm"&gt;[http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf Hahm, J-o.

The salary of a male engineer continues to experience growth as he gains experience whereas the female engineer sees her salary reach a plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-21358-5|pages=16–17|author=Margaret A.

Women, in the United States and many European countries, who succeed in science tend to be graduates of single-sex schools.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 3}}{{update inline|date=March 2016}}  Women earn 54% of all bachelor's degrees in the United States and 50% of those are in science.  9% of US physicists are women.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 2}}{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}

===Overview of situation in 2013===
[[File:The leaky pipeline, share of women in higher education and research, 2013.svg|thumb|The leaky pipeline, share of women in higher education and research worldwide, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 3.3, data from UNESCO Institute for Statistics.]]
In 2013, women accounted for 53% of the world's graduates at the bachelor's and master's level and 43% of successful PhD candidates but just 28% of researchers. Women graduates are consistently highly represented in the life sciences, often at over 50%. However, their representation in the other fields is inconsistent. In North America and much of Europe, few women graduate in physics, mathematics and computer science but, in other regions, the proportion of women may be close to parity in physics or mathematics. In engineering and computer sciences, women consistently trail men, a situation that is particularly acute in many high-income countries.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=84–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in decision-making ====
Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left. In 2015, the EU Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas called attention to this phenomenon, adding that the majority of entrepreneurs in science and engineering tended to be men. In Germany, the coalition agreement signed in 2013 introduces a 30% quota for women on company boards of directors.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Although data for most countries are limited, we know that women made up 14% of university chancellors and vice-chancellors at Brazilian public universities in 2010 and 17% of those in South Africa in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender, Science, Technology and Innovation: Brazil|last=Abreu|first=A.|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2011|isbn=|location=Brighton  (Canada)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participation of Girls and Women in the National STI System in South Africa|last=|first=|publisher=Academy of Sciences of South Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, women make up 16% of directors and vice-directors of national research centres and, in Mexico, 10% of directors of scientific research institutes at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender, Science, Technology and Innovation: Argentina|last=Bonder|first=Gloria|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brighton (Canada)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participation of Women and  Girls in National Education and the STI System in Mexico|last=Zubieta, J.|first=J.|last2=Herzig|first2=M.|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brighton (Canada).|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, numbers are slightly higher at 23%. In the EU, less than 16% of tertiary institutions were headed by a woman in 2010 and just 10% of universities. At the main tertiary institution for the English-speaking Caribbean, the University of the West Indies, women represented 51% of lecturers but only 32% of senior lecturers and 26% of full professors in 2011. Two reviews of national academies of science produce similarly low numbers, with women accounting for more than 25% of members in only a handful of countries, including Cuba, Panama and South Africa. The figure for Indonesia was 17%.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=She Figures 2012: Gender in Research and Innovation|last=|first=|publisher=Directorate-General for Research and Innovation of the European Union|year=2013|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender Equality in the Knowledge Society.

==== Women in life sciences ====
In life sciences, women researchers have achieved parity (45–55% of researchers) in many countries. In some, the balance even now tips in their favour. Six out of ten researchers are women in both medical and agricultural sciences in Belarus and New Zealand, for instance. More than two-thirds of researchers in medical sciences are women in El Salvador, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There has been a steady increase in female graduates in agricultural sciences since the turn of the century. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily, with eight countries reporting a share of women graduates of 40% or more: Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this surge are unclear, although one explanation may lie in the growing emphasis on national food security and the food industry. Another possible explanation is that women are highly represented in biotechnology. For example, in South Africa, women were underrepresented in engineering (16%) in 2004 and in ‘natural scientific professions’ (16%) in 2006 but made up 52% of employees working in biotechnology-related companies.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Women play an increasing role in environmental sciences and conservation biology. In fact women played a foremost role in the development of these disciplines. [[Silent Spring]] by Rachel Carson proved an important impetus to the conservation movement and the later banning of chemical pesticides. Women played an important role in conservation biology including the famous work of Dian Fossey, who published the famous [[Gorillas in the Mist]] and [[Jane Goodall]] who studied primates in East Africa. Today women make up an increasing proportion of roles in the active conservation sector. A recent survey of those working in the Wildlife Trusts in the U.K., the leading conservation organisation in England, found that there are nearly as many women as men in practical conservation roles.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. D. 2017. Gender equality in the wildlife trusts. ECOS. 38(6) https://www.academia.edu/35875487/Gender_equality_in_the_Wildlife_Trusts&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in engineering and related fields ====
Women are consistently underrepresented in engineering and related fields. In Israel, for instance, where 28% of senior academic staff are women, there are proportionately many fewer in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) but dominate education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%). In Japan and the Republic of Korea, women represent just 5% and 10% of engineers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In Europe and North America, the number of female graduates in engineering, physics, mathematics and computer science is generally low. Women make up just 19% of engineers in Canada, Germany and the US and 22% in Finland, for example. However,  50% of engineering graduates are women in Cyprus, 38% in Denmark and 36% in the Russian Federation, for instance.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In many cases, engineering has lost ground to other sciences, including agriculture. The case of New Zealand is fairly typical. Here, women jumped from representing 39% to 70% of agricultural graduates between 2000 and 2012, continued to dominate health (80–78%) but ceded ground in science (43–39%) and engineering (33–27%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In a number of developing countries, there is a sizable proportion of women engineers. At least three out of ten engineers are women, for instance, in Costa Rica, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates (31%), Algeria (32%), Mozambique (34%), Tunisia (41%) and Brunei Darussalam (42%). In Malaysia (50%)  and Oman (53%), women are on a par with men. Of the 13 sub-Saharan countries reporting data, seven have observed substantial increases (more than 5%) in women engineers since 2000, namely: Benin, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique and Namibia.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Of the seven Arab countries reporting data, four observe a steady percentage or an increase in female engineers (Morocco, Oman, Palestine and Saudi Arabia). In the United Arab Emirates, the government has made it a priority to develop a knowledge economy, having recognized the need for a strong human resource base in science, technology and engineering. With just 1% of the labour force being Emirati, it is also concerned about the low percentage of Emirati citizens employed in key industries. As a result, it has introduced policies promoting the training and employment of Emirati citizens, as well as a greater participation of Emirati women in the labour force. Emirati female engineering students have said that they are attracted to a career in engineering for reasons of financial independence, the high social status associated with this field, the opportunity to engage in creative and challenging projects and the wide range of career opportunities.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

An analysis of computer science shows a steady decrease in female graduates since 2000 that is particularly marked in high-income countries. Between 2000 and 2012, the share of women graduates in computer science slipped in Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and USA. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of women graduates in computer science dropped by between 2 and 13 percentage points over this period for all countries reporting data.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There are exceptions. In Denmark, the proportion of female graduates in computer science increased from 15% to 24% between 2000 and 2012 and Germany saw an increase from 10% to 17%. These are still very low levels. Figures are higher in many emerging economies. In Turkey, for instance, the proportion of women graduating in computer science rose from a relatively high 29% to 33% between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The Malaysian information technology (IT) sector is made up equally of women and men, with large numbers of women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to be supportive of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an [[Innovation in Malaysia|endogenous research culture]] should deepen this trend.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In India, the substantial increase in women undergraduates in engineering may be indicative of a change in the ‘masculine’ perception of engineering in the country. It is also a product of interest on the part of parents, since their daughters will be assured of employment as the field expands, as well as an advantageous marriage. Other factors include the ‘friendly’ image of engineering in India and the easy access to engineering education resulting from the increase in the number of women's engineering colleges over the last two decades.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

=== Regional trends as of 2013 ===
The global figures mask wide disparities from one region to another. In Southeast Europe, for instance, women researchers have obtained parity and, at 44%, are on the verge of doing so in Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the European Union, on the other hand, just one in three (33%) researchers is a woman, compared to 37% in the Arab world. Women are also better represented in sub-Saharan Africa (30%) than in South Asia (17%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There are also wide intraregional disparities. Women make up 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, for instance, and are close to parity in Malaysia and Vietnam, yet only one in three researchers is a woman in Indonesia and Singapore. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, two countries characterized by high researcher densities and technological sophistication, as few as 15% and 18% of researchers respectively are women. These are the lowest ratios among members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. The Republic of Korea also has the widest gap among OECD members in remuneration between men and women researchers (39%). There is also a yawning gap in Japan (29%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Latin America and the Caribbean ====
Latin America has some of the world's highest rates of women studying scientific fields; it also shares with the Caribbean one of the highest proportions of female researchers: 44%. Of the 12 countries reporting data for the years 2010–2013, seven have achieved gender parity, or even dominate research: Bolivia (63%), Venezuela (56%), Argentina (53%), Paraguay (52%), Uruguay (49%), Brazil (48%) and Guatemala (45%). Costa Rica is on the cusp (43%). Chile has the lowest score among countries for which there are recent data (31%). The Caribbean paints a similar picture, with Cuba having achieved gender parity (47%) and Trinidad and Tobago on 44%. Recent data on women's participation in industrial research are available for those countries with the most developed national innovation systems, with the exception of Brazil and Cuba: Uruguay (47%), Argentina (29%), Colombia and Chile (26%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

As in most other regions, the great majority of health graduates are women (60–85%). Women are also strongly represented in science. More than 40% of science graduates are women in each of Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama and Uruguay. The Caribbean paints a similar picture, with women graduates in science being on a par with men or dominating this field in Barbados, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In engineering, women make up over 30% of the graduate population in seven Latin American countries (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama and Uruguay) and one Caribbean country, the Dominican Republic. There has been a decrease in the number of women engineering graduates in Argentina, Chile and Honduras.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The participation of women in science has consistently dropped since the turn of the century. This trend has been observed in all sectors of the larger economies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Mexico is a notable exception, having recorded a slight increase. Some of the decrease may be attributed to women transferring to agricultural sciences in these countries. Another negative trend is the drop in female doctoral students and in the labour force. Of those countries reporting data, the majority signal a significant drop of 10–20 percentage points in the transition from master's to doctoral graduates.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe, West and Central Asia ====
Most countries in Eastern Europe, West and Central Asia have attained gender parity in research (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Ukraine) or are on the brink of doing so (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan). This trend is reflected in tertiary education, with some exceptions in engineering and computer science. Although Belarus and the Russian Federation have seen a drop over the past decade, women still represented 41% of researchers in 2013. In the former Soviet states, women are also very present in the business enterprise sector: Bosnia and Herzegovina (59%), Azerbaijan (57%), Kazakhstan (50%), Mongolia (48%), Latvia (48%), Serbia (46%), Croatia and Bulgaria (43%), Ukraine and Uzbekistan (40%), Romania and Montenegro (38%), Belarus (37%), Russian Federation (37%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

One in three researchers is a woman in Turkey (36%) and Tajikistan (34%). Participation rates are lower in Iran (26%) and Israel (21%), although Israeli women represent 28% of senior academic staff. At university, Israeli women dominate medical sciences (63%) but only a minority study engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer science (10%). There has been an interesting evolution in Iran. Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38–39% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Southeast Europe ====
With the exception of Greece, all the countries of Southeast Europe were once part of the Soviet bloc. Some 49% of researchers in these countries are women (compared to 37% in Greece in 2011). This high proportion is considered a legacy of the consistent investment in education by the Socialist governments in place until the early 1990s, including that of the former Yugoslavia. Moreover, the participation of female researchers is holding steady or increasing in much of the region, with representation broadly even across the four sectors of government, business, higher education and non-profit. In most countries, women tend to be on a par with men among tertiary graduates in science. Between 70% and 85% of graduates are women in health, less than 40% in agriculture and between 20% and 30% in engineering. Albania has seen a considerable increase in the share of its women graduates in engineering and agriculture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== European Union ====
Women make up 33% of researchers overall in the European Union (EU), slightly more than their representation in science (32%). Women constitute 40% of researchers in higher education, 40% in government and 19% in the private sector, with the number of female researchers increasing faster than that of male researchers. The proportion of female researchers has been increasing over the last decade, at a faster rate than men (5.1% annually over 2002–2009 compared with 3.3% for men), which is also true for their participation among scientists and engineers (up 5.4% annually between 2002 and 2010, compared with 3.1% for men).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Despite these gains, women's academic careers in Europe remain characterized by strong vertical and horizontal segregation. In 2010, although female students (55%) and graduates (59%) outnumbered male students, men outnumbered women at the PhD and graduate levels (albeit by a small margin). Further along in the research career, women represented 44% of grade C academic staff, 37% of grade B academic staff and 20% of grade A academic staff.11 These trends are intensified in science, with women making up 31% of the student population at the tertiary level to 38% of PhD students and 35% of PhD graduates. At the faculty level, they make up 32% of academic grade C personnel, 23% of grade B and 11% of grade A. The proportion of women among full professors is lowest in engineering and technology, at 7.9%. With respect to representation in science decision-making, in 2010 15.5% of higher education institutions were headed by women and 10% of universities had a female rector.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Membership on science boards remained predominantly male as well, with women making up 36% of board members. The EU has engaged in a major effort to integrate female researchers and gender research into its research and innovation strategy since the mid-2000s. Increases in women's representation in all of the scientific fields overall indicates that this effort has met with some success; however, the continued lack of representation of women at the top level of faculties, management and science decision making indicate that more work needs to be done. The EU is addressing this through a gender equality strategy and crosscutting mandate in [[Horizon 2020]], its research and innovation funding programme for 2014–2020.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Australia, New Zealand and USA ====
In 2013, women made up the majority of PhD graduates in fields related to health in Australia (63%), New Zealand (58%) and the United States of America (73%). The same can be said of agriculture, in New Zealand's case (73%). Women have also achieved parity in agriculture in Australia (50%) and the United States (44%). Just one in five women graduate in engineering in the latter two countries, a situation that has not changed over the past decade. In New Zealand, women jumped from constituting 39% to 70% of agricultural graduates (all levels) between 2000 and 2012 but ceded ground in science (43–39%), engineering (33–27%) and health (80–78%). As for Canada, it has not reported sex-disaggregated data for women graduates in science and engineering in recent years. Moreover, none of the four countries mentioned here have reported recent data on the share of female researchers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== South Asia ====
South Asia is the region where women make up the smallest proportion of researchers: 17%. This is 13 percentage points below sub-Saharan Africa. Of those countries in South Asia reporting data for 2009–2013, Nepal has the lowest representation of all (in head counts), at 8% (2010), a substantial drop from 15% in 2002. In 2013, only 14% of researchers (in full-time equivalents) were women in the region's most populous country, India, down slightly from 15% in 2009. The percentage of female researchers is highest in Sri Lanka (39%), followed by Pakistan: 24% in 2009, 31% in 2013. There are no recent data available for Afghanistan or Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Women are most present in the private non-profit sector – they make up 60% of employees in Sri Lanka – followed by the academic sector: 30% of Pakistani and 42% of Sri Lankan female researchers. Women tend to be less present in the government sector and least likely to be employed in the business sector, accounting for 23% of employees in Sri Lanka, 11% in India and just 5% in Nepal. Women have achieved parity in science in both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh but are less likely to undertake research in engineering. They represent 17% of the research pool in Bangladesh and 29% in Sri Lanka. Many Sri Lankan women have followed the global trend of opting for a career in agricultural sciences (54%) and they have also achieved parity in health and welfare. In Bangladesh, just over 30% choose agricultural sciences and health, which goes against the global trend. Although Bangladesh still has progress to make, the share of women in each scientific field has increased steadily over the past decade.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Southeast Asia ====
Southeast Asia presents a different picture entirely, with women basically on a par with men in some countries: they make up 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, for example. Other countries are close to parity, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, whereas Indonesia and Singapore are still around the 30% mark. Cambodia trails its neighbours at 20%. Female researchers in the region are spread fairly equally across the sectors of participation, with the exception of the private sector, where they make up 30% or less of researchers in most countries.

The proportion of women tertiary graduates reflects these trends, with high percentages of women in science in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines (around 60%) and a low of 10% in Cambodia. Women make up the majority of graduates in health sciences, from 60% in Laos to 81% in Myanmar – Vietnam being an exception at 42%. Women graduates are on a par with men in agriculture but less present in engineering: Vietnam (31%), the Philippines (30%) and Malaysia (39%); here, the exception is Myanmar, at 65%. In the Republic of Korea, women make up about 40% of graduates in science and agriculture and 71% of graduates in health sciences but only 18% of female researchers overall. This represents a loss in the investment made in educating girls and women up through tertiary education, a result of traditionalviews of women's role in society and in the home. Kim and Moon (2011) remark on the tendency of Korean women to withdraw from the labour force to take care of children and assume family responsibilities, calling it a ‘domestic brain drain’.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Women remain very much a minority in Japanese science (15% in 2013), although the situation has improved slightly (13% in 2008) since the government fixed a target in 2006 of raising the ratio of female researchers to 25%. Calculated on the basis of the current number of doctoral students, the government hopes to obtain a 20% share of women in science, 15% in engineering and 30% in agriculture and health by the end of the current ''Basic Plan for Science and Technology'' in 2016. In 2013, Japanese female researchers were most common in the public sector in health and agriculture, where they represented 29% of academics and 20% of government researchers. In the business sector, just 8% of researchers were women (in head counts), compared to 25% in the academic sector. In other public research institutions, women accounted for 16% of researchers. One of the main thrusts of [[Abenomics]], Japan's current growth strategy, is to enhance the socio-economic role of women. Consequently, the selection criteria for most large university grants now take into account the proportion of women among teaching staff and researchers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The low ratio of women researchers in Japan and the Republic of Korea, which both have some of the highest researcher densities in the world, brings down Southeast Asia's average to 22.5% for the share of women among researchers in the region.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Arab States ====
At 37%, the share of female researchers in the Arab States compares well with other regions. The countries with the highest proportion of female researchers are Bahrain and Sudan at around 40%. Jordan, Libya, Oman, Palestine and Qatar have percentage shares in the low twenties. The country with the lowest participation of female researchers is Saudi Arabia, even though they make up the majority of tertiary graduates, but the figure of 1.4% covers only the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. Female researchers in the region are primarily employed in government research institutes, with some countries also seeing a high participation of women in private nonprofit organizations and universities. With the exception of Sudan (40%) and Palestine (35%), fewer than one in four researchers in the business enterprise sector is a woman; for half of the countries reporting data, there are barely any women at all employed in this sector.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Despite these variable numbers, the percentage of female tertiary-level graduates in science and engineering is very high across the region, which indicates there is a substantial drop between graduation and employment and research. Women make up half or more than half of science graduates in all but Sudan and over 45% in agriculture in eight out of the 15 countries reporting data, namely Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. In engineering, women make up over 70% of graduates in Oman, with rates of 25–38% in the majority of the other countries, which is high in comparison to other regions.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The participation of women is somewhat lower in health than in other regions, possibly on account of cultural norms restricting interactions between males and females. Iraq and Oman have the lowest percentages (mid-30s), whereas Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine and Saudi Arabia are at gender parity in this field. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have the highest rates of all: 83% and 84%.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Once Arab women scientists and engineers graduate, they may come up against barriers to finding gainful employment. These include a misalignment between university programmes and labour market demand – a phenomenon which also affects men –, a lack of awareness about what a career in their chosen field entails, family bias against working in mixed-gender environments and a lack of female role models.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samulewicz|first=D.|last2=Vidican|first2=G. and N. G. Aswad|year=2012|title=Barriers to pursuing careers in science, technology and engineering for women in the United Arab Emirates .|url=|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=125–52|via=|doi=10.1177/097185241201600201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the countries with the smallest female labour force is developing technical and vocational education for girls as part of a wider scheme to reduce dependence on foreign labour. By 2017, the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation of Saudi Arabia is to have constructed 50 technical colleges, 50 girls’ higher technical institutes and 180 industrial secondary institutes. The plan is to create training placements for about 500 000 students, half of them girls. Boys and girls will be trained in vocational professions that include information technology, medical equipment handling, plumbing, electricity and mechanics.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
Just under one in three (30%) researchers in sub-Saharan Africa is a woman. Much of sub-Saharan Africa is seeing solid gains in the share of women among tertiary graduates in scientific fields. In two of the top four countries for women's representation in science, women graduates are part of very small cohorts, however: they make up 54% of Lesotho's 47 tertiary graduates in science and 60% of those in Namibia's graduating class of 149. South Africa and Zimbabwe, which have larger graduate populations in science, have achieved parity, with 49% and 47% respectively. The next grouping clusters seven countries poised at around 35–40% (Angola, Burundi, Eritrea, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique and Rwanda). The rest are grouped around 30% or below (Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Swaziland and Uganda). Burkina Faso ranks lowest, with women making up 18% of its science graduates.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Female representation in engineering is fairly high in sub-Saharan Africa in comparison with other regions. In Mozambique and South Africa, for instance, women make up more than 34% and 28% of engineering graduates, respectively. Numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily across the continent, with eight countries reporting the share of women graduates of 40% or more (Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). In health, this rate ranges from 26% and 27% in Benin and Eritrea to 94% in Namibia.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Of note is that women account for a relatively high proportion of researchers employed in the business enterprise sector in South Africa (35%), Kenya (34%), [[Science and technology in Botswana|Botswana]] and Namibia (33%) and Zambia (31%). Female participation in industrial research is lower in Uganda (21%), Ethiopia (15%) and Mali (12%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

== Lack of agency and representation of women in science ==

=== Social pressures that repress femininity ===
Beginning in the late twentieth century{{Original research inline|date=March 2016}} to present day, more and more women are becoming involved in science. However, women often find themselves at odds with expectations held towards them in relation to their scientific studies. For example, in 1968 James Watson questioned scientist Rosalind Franklin's place in the industry. He claimed that "the best place for a feminist was in another person's lab",&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}} most often a male's research lab.{{Synthesis inline|date=March 2016}} Women were and still are often critiqued of their overall presentation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In Franklin's situation, she was seen as lacking femininity for she failed to wear lipstick or revealing clothing.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}} Women believed that in order to gain recognition, they needed to hide their feminine qualities, to thus appear more masculine.  For example, women in the sixties often wore male clothing, which often did not fit for the pant's inseam was sized for a man and not a woman's leg. This conformity had little benefit besides men demoralizing them for lack of femininity.

Since most of their colleagues in science are men, women also find themselves left out of opportunities to discuss possible research opportunities outside of the laboratory. In Londa Scheibinger's book, ''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', she mentions that men would have discussed their research outside of the lab, but this conversation is preceded by talk of sports or other “masculine” topics that excluded women from the conversation.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger2001" /&gt;{{rp|81–91}} Consequently, this act of excluding women from the after-hours work discussions produced a more separate work environment between the men and the women in science; as women then would converse with other women in science about their current findings and theories. Ultimately, the women's work was devalued as a male scientist was not involved in the overall research and analysis.

According to Oxford University Press, the inequality toward women is “endorsed within cultures and entrenched within institutions [that] hold power to reproduce that inequality”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cech|first=Erin A.|last2=Blair-Loy|first2=Mary|date=2010-01-01|title=Perceiving Glass Ceilings? Meritocratic versus Structural Explanations of Gender Inequality among Women in Science and Technology|jstor=10.1525/sp.2010.57.3.371|journal=Social Problems|volume=57|issue=3|pages=371–397|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various gendered barriers in social networks that prevent women from working in male-dominated fields and top management jobs. Social networks are based on the cultural beliefs such as schemas and stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; According to social psychology studies, top management jobs are more likely to have incumbent schemas that favor “an achievement-oriented aggressiveness and emotional toughness that is distinctly male in character”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; Gender stereotypes of feminine style set by men assume women to be conforming and submissive to male culture creating a sense of unqualified women for top management jobs. However, when the women try to prove their competence and power, they often faced obstacles. They are likely to be seen as dislikable and untrustworthy even when they excel at “masculine” tasks.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397"/&gt; In addition, women's achievements are likely to be dismissed or discredited.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; These “untrustworthy, dislikable women” could have very well been denied achievement from the fear men held of a woman overtaking his management position. Social networks and gender stereotypes produce many injustices that women have to experience in their workplace, as well as, the various obstacles they encounter when trying to advance in male-dominated and top management jobs. Women in professions like science, technology, and other related industries are likely to encounter these gendered barriers in their careers.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; Based on the meritocratic explanations of gender inequality, “as long as the people accept the mechanisms that produce unequal outcomes,” all the outcomes will be legitimated in the society.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; When women try to deny the stereotypes and the discriminations by becoming “competent, integrated, well-liked”, the society is more likely to look at these impressions as selfishness or “being a whiner”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; However, there have been positive attempts to reduce gender discrimination in the public domain. For example, in the United States, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides opportunities for women to achieve to a wide range of education programs and activities by prohibiting sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="aauw.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org|title=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|website=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."&lt;ref name="aauw.org" /&gt; Although, even with laws prohibiting gender discrimination, society and social institutions continue to minimize women's competencies and accomplishments, especially, in the workforce by dismissing or discrediting their achievements as stated above.

===Underrepresentation of queer women in STEM fields===
Cisgender heterosexual women are underrepresented in STEM fields and there has been a push to encourage more women to join the sciences.&lt;ref name="bu.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/research/articles/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/|title=Is Science Too Straight?|last=Moran|first=Barbara|date=2015-06-17|website=Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of data and statistics of LGBTQ members involvement in the STEM field, it illustrates that lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women are even more repressed and underrepresented than their straight female peers.&lt;ref name="bu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/opinion/manil-suri-why-is-science-so-straight.html|title=Why Is Science So Straight?|last=Suri|first=Manil|date=2015-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bu.edu" /&gt; Reasons for underrepresentation of queer women in STEM fields include lack of role models in K–12,&lt;ref name="bu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unsay|first=Joseph D.|date=2017-03-27|title=Where are all the LGBT scientists?

Historically, women who have accepted STEM research positions for the government or the military remained in the closet due to lack of federal protections or the fact that LGBT expression was criminalized in their country.

In a nationwide study of LGBTQA employees in STEM fields in the United States, queer women in engineering, earth sciences, and mathematics reported that they were less likely to be out in the workplace.&lt;ref name="static1.squarespace.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Jeremy B.|last2=Mattheis|first2=Allison|date=2015-10-26|title=Queer in STEM: Workplace Experiences Reported in a National Survey of LGBTQA Individuals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Careers|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56b14b283c44d80f317c5948/t/56e1bf7f37013b87984bbbeb/1457635202124/Queer+in+STEM.pdf|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1080/00918369.2015.1078632|pmid=26241115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, LGBTQA people in this survey reported that, when more female-identified people worked in their labs, the more accepting and safe the work environment.&lt;ref name="static1.squarespace.com" /&gt; In another study of over 30,000 LGBT employees in STEM-related federal agencies in the United States, queer women in these agencies reported feeling isolated in the workplace and having to work harder than their cisgender male colleagues.

Organizations such as [[Lesbians Who Tech]], [[National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals]] (NOGLSTP), [[Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|Out in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics]] (OSTEM), [[Pride in STEM]], and [[House of STEM]] currently provide networking and mentoring opportunities for queer girls and women interested in or currently working in STEM fields. These organizations also advocate for the rights of queer women in STEM in education and the workplace.

==Reasons to why women are disadvantaged in science==
[[Margaret W. Rossiter|Margaret Rossiter]], an American historian of science, offered three concepts to explain the reasons behind the data in statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in the science industry. The first concept is hierarchical segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|title=Science And Women|encyclopedia=Women's Studies Encyclopedia|url=http://gem.greenwood.com/wse/wseDisplay.jsp?id=id586&amp;ss=aristotle|accessdate=9 November 2013|last=Tierney|first=Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a well-known phenomenon in society, that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige, the smaller the population of females participating. The hierarchical differences point out that there are fewer women participating at higher levels of both academia and industry. Based on data collected in 1982, women earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States, with 50 percent of these in science. The source also indicated that this number increased almost every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hahm, J-o. Data on Women in S&amp;E. From: Women, Minorities and Persons With Disabilities in Science and Engineering, NSF 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There are fewer women at the graduate level; they earn 40 percent of all doctorates, with 31 percent of these in science and engineering.

The second concept included in Rossiter's explanation of women in science is [[Gender segregation|territorial segregation]].&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|34–35}} The term refers to how female employment is often clustered in specific industries or categories in industries. Women stayed at home or took employment in feminine fields while men left the home to work. Although nearly half of the civilian work force is female, women still comprise the majority of low-paid jobs or jobs that society considered feminine. Statistics show that 60 percent of white professional women are nurses, daycare workers, or schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_049211.pdf|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorial disparities in science are often found between the 1920s and 1930s, when different fields in science were divided between men and women. Men dominated the chemistry, medical sciences, and engineering, while women dominated the fields of botany, zoology, and psychology. The fields in which the majority of women are concentrated are known as the "soft" sciences and tend to have relatively low salaries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Researchers collected the data on many differences between women and men in science. Rossiter found that in 1966, thirty-eight percent of female scientists held master's degrees compared to twenty-six percent of male scientists; but large proportions of female scientists were in environmental and nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name="Science Reader 2001"&gt;The Gender and Science Reader, edited by Muriel Lederman And Ingrid Bartsch, section one, Eisenhart and Elizabeth Finkel, 2001, first published by Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s and 1970s, equal-rights legislation made the number of female scientists rise dramatically. The statistics from [[National Science Board]] (NSB) present the change at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The number of science degrees awarded to woman rose from seven percent in 1970 to twenty-four percent in 1985. In 1975 only 385 women received bachelor's degrees in engineering compared to 11,000 women in 1985, indicating the importance of legislation to the representation of women in science.{{Synthesis inline|date=March 2016}} Elizabeth Finkel claims that even if the number of women participating in scientific fields increases, the opportunities are still limited.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Jabos, who worked for NSB, reported the pattern of women in receiving doctoral degrees in science: even though the numbers of female scientists with higher-level degrees increased, they still were consistently in a minority.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Another reporter, Harriet Zuckerman, claims that when woman and man have similar abilities for a job, the probability of the woman getting the job is lower.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Elizabeth Finkel agrees, saying, "In general, while woman and men seem to be completing doctorate with similar credentials and experience, the opposition and rewards they find are not comparable. Women tend to be treated with less salary and status, many policy makers notice this phenomenon and try to rectify the unfair situation for women participating in scientific fields."&lt;ref name="Science Reader 2001" /&gt;

==Contemporary advocacy and developments of women in science==

===Efforts to increase participation===
A number of organizations have been set up to combat the stereotyping that may encourage girls away from careers in these areas.  In the UK [[The WISE Campaign]] (Women into Science, Engineering and Construction) and the [[UKRC]] (The UK Resource Centre for Women in SET) are collaborating to ensure industry, academia and education are all aware of the importance of challenging the traditional approaches to careers advice and recruitment that mean some of the best brains in the country are lost to science.  The [[UKRC]] and other women's networks provide female role models, resources and support for activities that promote science to girls and women. The [[Women's Engineering Society]], a professional association in th UK, has been supporting women in engineering and science since 1919.  In computing, the [[British Computer Society]] group [[BCSWomen]] is active in encouraging girls to consider computing careers, and in supporting women in the computing workforce.

In the United States, the [[Association for Women in Science]] is one of the most prominent organization for professional women in science.  In 2011, the [[Scientista Foundation]] was created to empower pre-professional college and graduate women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), to stay in the career track.  There are also several organizations focused on increasing mentorship from a younger age. One of the best known groups is [[Science Club for Girls]], which pairs undergraduate mentors with high school and middle school mentees. The model of that pairs undergraduate college mentors with younger students is quite popular. In addition, many young women are creating programs to boost participation in STEM at a younger level, either through conferences or competitions.

In efforts to make women scientists more visible to the general public, the [[Grolier Club]] in [[New York City|New York]] hosted a "landmark exhibition" titled "Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement", showcasing the lives and works of 32 women scientists in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=65321|title=Landmark exhibition recognizes the achievements of women in science and medicine at The Grolier Club|date=2013-12-22|work=artdaily.org|accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) developed a video series highlighting the stories of female researchers at NIOSH.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/2013-wis/|title=CDC – Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic – Science Speaks: A Focus on NIOSH Women in Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the women featured in the videos share their journey into science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), and offers encouragement to aspiring scientists.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov" /&gt;  NIOSH also partners with external organizations in efforts to introduce individuals to scientific disciplines and funds several science-based training programs across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/oep/trainresearch.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Grants and Funding – Extramural Research and Training Programs – Research and Training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/training/default.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Training and Workforce Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women scientists in the media ====
In 2013, journalist [[Christie Aschwanden]] noted that a type of media coverage of women scientists that "treats its subject's sex as her most defining detail" was still prevalent. She proposed a checklist, the "[[Finkbeiner test]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doublexscience.org/the-finkbeiner-test/|title=The Finkbeiner Test: What matters in stories about women scientists?|last=Aschwanden|first=Christie|date=5 March 2013|newspaper=Double X Science|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help avoid this approach.&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all|title=‘The Finkbeiner Test’ Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists|last=Brainard|first=Curtis|date=22 March 2013|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cited in the coverage of a much-criticized 2013 ''New York Times'' obituary of rocket scientist [[Yvonne Brill]] that began with the words: "She made a mean beef stroganoff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/the-new-york-times-fails-miserably-in-its-obituary-for-464140204|title=The New York Times fails miserably in its obituary for rocket scientist Yvonne Brill|last=Gonzalez|first=Robert T.|date=31 March 2013|newspaper=[[io9]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable controversies and developments===
A study conducted at [[Lund University]] in 2010 and 2011 analysed the genders of invited contributors to ''News &amp; Views'' in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''Perspectives'' in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.  It found that 3.8% of the Earth and environmental science contributions to ''News &amp; Views'' were written by women even while the field was estimated to be 16–20% female in the United States.  ''Nature'' responded by suggesting that, worldwide, a significantly lower number of Earth scientists were women, but nevertheless committed to address any disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/gender-bias-leading-journals|title=Gender bias in leading journals|last=Nordahl|first=Marianne|date=2012-09-08|publisher=Science Nordic|accessdate=2015-10-27|quote=should we find that the News &amp; Views section is indeed under-representing women, we will certainly take steps to redress the balance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a journal article published in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS) reported a gender bias among science faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss-Racusin|first=Corinne A.|author2=John F. Dovidiob|author3=Victoria L. Brescollc|author4=Mark J. Grahama|author5=Jo Handelsman|date=August 2012|title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109|journal=PNAS|volume=109|issue=41|pages=16395–16396|bibcode=2012PNAS..10916474M|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmc=3478626|pmid=22988126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty were asked to review a resume from a hypothetical student and report how likely they would be to hire or mentor that student, as well as what they would offer as starting salary.  Two resumes were distributed randomly to the faculty, only differing in the names at the top of the resume (John or Jennifer).  The male student was rated as significantly more competent, more likely to be hired, and more likely to be mentored.  The median starting salary offered to the male student was greater than $3,000 over the starting salary offered to the female student.  Both male and female faculty exhibited this gender bias.  This study suggests bias may partly explain the persistent deficit in the number of women at the highest levels of scientific fields.  Another study reported that men are favored in some domains, such as biology tenure rates, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair; the authors interpreted this to suggest that the under-representation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=S.

In 2014, a [[Shirtstorm|controversy]] over the depiction of pinup women on [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] project scientist Matt Taylor's shirt during a press conference raised questions of sexism within the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/13/why-women-in-science-are-annoyed-at-rosetta-mission-scientists-clothing|title=Why women in science are annoyed at Rosetta mission scientist's clothing|last1=Bell|first1=Alice|date=13 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shirt, which featured cartoon women with firearms, led to an outpouring of criticism and an apology after which Taylor "broke down in tears."&lt;ref name="The Independent 2014-11-30" /&gt;

In 2015, stereotypes about women in science were directed at Fiona Ingleby, research fellow in evolution, behavior, and environment at the [[University of Sussex]], and Megan Head, postdoctoral researcher at the [[Australian National University]], when they submitted a paper analyzing the progression of PhD graduates to postdoctoral positions in the life sciences to the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elsei, Holly.  ″′Sexist′ peer review causes storm online.″  ''Times Higher Education'' 30 April 2015: Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors received an email on March 27 informing them that their paper had been rejected due to its poor quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The email included comments from an anonymous reviewer, which included the suggestion that male authors be added in order to improve the quality of the science and serve as a means of ensuring that incorrect interpretations of the data are not included.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Ingleby posted excerpts from the email on [[Twitter]] on April 29 bringing the incident to the attention of the public and media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The editor was dismissed from the journal and the reviewer was removed from the list of potential reviewers.  A spokesman from PLOS apologized to the authors and said they would be given the opportunity to have the paper reviewed again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On June 9, 2015, Nobel prize winning biochemist [[Tim Hunt]] spoke at the World Conference of Science Journalists in [[Seoul]].  Prior to applauding the work of women scientists, he described emotional tension, saying "you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry."&lt;ref name="Radcliffe"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-female-scientists-cause-trouble-for-men-in-labs|title=Nobel scientist Tim Hunt: female scientists cause trouble for men in labs|last=Radcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=10 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, his [[Sir Tim Hunt controversy at WCSJ|remarks]] were widely condemned and he was forced to resign from his position at [[University College London]].  However, multiple conference attendees gave accounts, including a partial transcript and a partial recording, maintaining that his comments were understood to be satirical before being taken out of context by the media.&lt;ref name="Times_Moody_18July"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/article4501733.ece|title=Recording ‘shows Sir Tim was joking’|last1=Moody|first1=Oliver|date=18 July 2015|work=The Times|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 an article published in ''[[JAMA Dermatology]]'' reported a significant and dramatic downward trend in the number of NIH-funded woman investigators in the field of dermatology and that the gender gap between male and female NIH-funded dermatology investigators was widening.  The article concluded that this disparity was likely due to a lack of institutional support for women investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Michelle A.|author2=Annie Sukhov|author3=Hawa Sultani|author4=Koungmi Kim|author5=Emanual Maverakis|date=May 2016|title=Trends in National Institutes of Health Funding of Principal Investigators in Dermatology Research by Academic Degree and Sex|url=http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2522760|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=152|issue=8|pages=883–8|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0271|pmid=27191545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Problematic public statements ====
In January 2005, [[Harvard University]] President [[Lawrence Summers]] sparked controversy at a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce. Dr. Summers offered his explanation for the shortage of women in senior posts in science and engineering. He made comments suggesting the lower numbers of women in high-level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women. Making references to the field and behavioral genetics, he noted the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) on tests of cognitive abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedges|first1=L. V.|last2=Nowell|first2=A.|year=1995|title=Sex differences in mental scores, variability, and numbers of high scoring individuals|url=http://atavisionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sex-differences-in-mental-test-scores-variability-and-numbers-of-high-scoring-individuals-1995-hedges-nowell.pdf|journal=Science|volume=269|issue=5220|pages=41–45|bibcode=1995Sci...269...41H|doi=10.1126/science.7604277|pmid=7604277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehrke, R. (1997). Sex linkage of intelligence: The X-Factor. NY: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubinski|first1=D.|last2=Benbow|first2=C. M.|year=2006|title=Study of mathematically precocious youth after 35 years|url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/DoingPsychScience20061.pdf|journal=[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]]|volume=1|issue=4|pages=316–345|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00019.x|pmid=26151798}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to proportionally more men than women at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions. In his discussion of this, Summers said that "even small differences in the standard deviation [between genders] will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [from the mean]".&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce]. 14 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers concluded his discussion by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination.&lt;ref name="harvard2005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite his protégée, Sheryl Sandberg, defending Summers’ actions and Summers offering his own apology repeatedly, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences passed a motion of “lack of confidence” in the leadership of Summers who had allowed tenure offers to women plummet after taking office in 2001.&lt;ref name="harvard2005" /&gt; The year before he became president, Harvard extended 13 of its 36 tenure offers to women and by 2004 those numbers had dropped to 4 of 32 with several departments lacking even a single tenured female professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/education/06iht-ffharvard.html|title=After Harvard Controversy, Conditions Change but Reputation Lingers|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2010-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy is speculated to have significantly contributed to Summers resignation from his position at Harvard the following year.
