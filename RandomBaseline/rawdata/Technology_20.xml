The '''access stratum''' (AS) is a functional layer in the [[UMTS]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless telecom [[protocol stack]]s between [[radio network]] and [[user equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;

While the definition of the access stratum is very different between UMTS and LTE, in both cases the access stratum is responsible for transporting data over the wireless connection and managing radio resources.   The radio network is also called access network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17000">'''Audience analysis''' is a task that is often performed by [[technical writer]]s in a project's early stages. It consists of assessing the audience to make sure the information provided to them is at the appropriate level.  The audience is often referred to as the [[end-user]], and all communications need to be targeted towards the defined audience.  Defining an audience requires the consideration of many factors, such as age, [[culture]] and knowledge of the subject.  After considering all the known factors, a profile of the intended audience can be created, allowing writers to write in a manner that is understood by the intended audience.

==Process==
Audience analysis involves gathering and interpreting information about the recipients of [[Speech communication|oral]], [[written]], or [[visual]] communication.

There are numerous methods that a technical communicator can use to conduct the analysis.  Because the task of completing an audience analysis can be overwhelming, using a multi-pronged approach to conduct the analysis is recommended by most professors, often yielding improved accuracy and efficiency.  Michael Albers suggests that an analysis use several independent guestofaguest that work together, such as reader knowledge of the topic and reader cognitive comprehension.

Writers can also use conversation, in-depth interviews or focus groups to help them to complete an audience analysis.  Conversation as well as other qualitative research techniques will allow the communicator to consider the multiple cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts of their target audience, producing a valuable audience analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bocchi, Joseph S.  "Forming Constructs of Audience Convention, Conflict, and Conversation."  ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication.''  5 (1991):  151-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

David L. Carson of the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] asserted that technical communicators most often perform their jobs with little or no knowledge about their audience.  Carson states that the analysis should include a reader's level of comprehension of the technical vocabulary and motivation, as well as reading level. Indicators of a reader's high level of motivation include high interest in the subject matter, relatively high knowledge of the content, and high personal stakes in mastering the information.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, David L.  "Audience in Technical Writing:  The Need for Greater Realism in Identifying the Fictive Reader."  ''The Technical Writing Teacher.''  7 (1979):  8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique used to conduct an audience analysis is the "bottom-up" approach.  Leon de Stadler and Sarah van der Land&lt;ref&gt;In their article "Knowing Your Audience and Audience Participation in the Field"&lt;/ref&gt; explore this type of approach in reference to a document produced by an organization that develops different kinds of interventions in the field of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] [[education]].  This particular document focused on the use of [[contraception]] and targeted the [[Black people|black]] [[youth]] of [[South Africa]].  The initial document was created by document designers in the [[United States]] who did not base their design on an extensive audience analysis. As a result, the document, which used the informal slang of black South African youth, did not effectively communicate with its target audience.  After the dissemination of the document, Van der Land used [[focus groups]] and [[interview]]s of a sample of the target audience to discover what improvements should be made.  Upon considering the audience's perspective, she found that the initial document's use of the hip-style language backfired.  The interviewees indicated that the use of the popular language was not effective because it was not used correctly or consistently throughout the document.  Additionally, to the target audience, the informal language did not fit the seriousness of the topic being discussed.  The suggested "bottom-up" approach should have incorporated the target audience during the design process instead of as an afterthought.

Marjorie Rush Hovde provides even more tactics that can be implemented in the process of an audience analysis in relation to one's organization.  She suggests talking with users during [[Customer support|phone support]] calls, interacting with users face-to-face, drawing on the writer's own experiences with the [[software]] and documentation, interacting with use-contact people within the organization, studying responses sent from users after the documentation is released, and conducting internal user-testing.  Like Michael Albers, Hovde asserts that the use of a combination of tactics proves to produce a more accurate audience analysis than using one tactic alone.&lt;ref&gt;Hovde, Marjorie Rush.  "Tactics for Building Images of Audience in Organizational Contexts:  An Ethnographic Study of Technical Communicators."  ''Journal of Business and Technical Communication.''  14 (2000):  395-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen D. Holl&lt;ref&gt;An editor for ''Restoration Ecology'', in her article "Writing for an International Audience,"&lt;/ref&gt; discusses what writers should consider when writing papers that address an international audience.  She focuses on those writers who attempt to publish studies in publications that are circulated abroad.  She suggests that these writers consider the following questions when framing their papers:  What conclusions from my study would be relevant and novel to land managers and scientists working in other ecosystems and socio-economic contexts?, What is the geographic scope of the literature I am citing?, To which ecological and socio-economic systems do my world view and results apply?, Is my study sufficiently well replicated to generalize my results?,  and Are my conclusions supported by my data and, conversely, are all my data necessary to support my conclusions?.  Although she focuses her suggestions on scientific studies, she acknowledges that "what is critical to effectively communicate the results of any study is to consider what conclusions will be of most interest to the target audience."  Holl concludes that knowing how to address an international audience is a vital skill that successful scientists, as well as technical communicators, must possess.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Karen D.  "Writing for an International Audience."  ''Restoration Ecology.''  18 (2010):  135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth of analysis==
There are often a large number of factors to consider, thus making it hard for the writer to completely assess the target audience within a reasonable amount of time.  Therefore, an attempt to reach the most accurate and effective audience analysis, in a [[time]]ly manner, is vital to the technical [[communication]] process. The depth of the audience analysis also depends of the size of the intended audience.

Because people constantly change in terms of technological exposure, the audience to be analyzed constantly changes.  As a result, the technical communicator must consider the possibility that their audience changes over time. An article in the [[European Journal of Communication]] examined the change audience research has experienced due to the growing range of information and communication technologies.  The article pointed out that there are three main challenges that drive the search for methodological rigor:  the difference between what people say they do and what they do in practice, the interpretation of the text by the reader,  and why the received meanings of television matter in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, Sonia.  "The Challenge of Changing Audiences, Or What is the Audience Researcher to do in the Age of the Internet?."  ''European Journal of Communication.''  19 (2004):  75-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  An absolutely perfect audience analysis is generally impossible to create, and it is similarly difficult to create an analysis that is relevant for a long period of time.  Revising and rewriting an audience analysis is often required in order to maintain the relevance of the analysis.

===Specific applications of audience analysis===

R. C. Goldworthy, C. B. Mayhorn and A. W. Meade, dealt with the hazard mitigation, including warning development, validation, and dissemination as an important aspect of [[product safety]] and workplace and [[consumer protection]] in their article "Warnings in Manufacturing:  Improving Hazard-Mitigation Messaging through Audience Analysis". In this study, they focused on the potential role of [[latent class analysis]] in regards to the audience analysis performed in hazard communication and [[warning message]]s. Their qualitative study involved 700 adult and adolescent participants who answered a structured questionnaire about prescription medication history, [[prescription medication]] loaning/borrowing history, and likelihood of sharing/borrowing medication. With this information, four latent classes were identified: Abstainers, Pragmatic frequent sharers, At-risk sharers, and Emergency sharers. The identification of latent classes based on behaviors of interest facilitated tailoring hazard-mitigation efforts to specific groups. Although their study is limited, in that all participants were between the ages of twelve and forty-four and were from heavily populated urban area (so the generalizability of the data to rural settings has not been generated), this study establishes that latent class analysis can play a vital role. They conclude that latent analysis is a worthwhile addition to the analytical toolbox because it allows, in this case, risk reduction and hazard-mitigation efforts to tailor interventions to a diverse target audience. For the technical writer, analyzing latent classes would enable them to better identify homogenous groups within the broader population of readers and across many variables to tailor messages to these better-specified groups.&lt;ref&gt;Goldworthy, Richard C., Christopher B. Mayhorn, and Adam W. Meade. "Warnings in Manufacturing:  Improving Hazard-Mitigation Messaging through Audience Analysis". ''Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing and Service Industries''. 20 (2010):  484-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of older adults is growing, and Gail Lippincott asserts that technical communicators have not accounted for the needs of these audiences, nor drawn from the wide range of research on aging. In her article "Gray Matters: Where are the Technical Communicator in Research and Design for Aging Audiences?", Lippincott suggests four challenges that practitioners, educators, and researchers must undertake to accommodate older adults' physical, cognitive, and emotional needs: They must refine the demographic variable of age, operationalize age to enrich current methods of audience analysis, investigate multidisciplinary sources of aging research, and participate in research on aging by offering our expertise in document design and communication strategies. Lippincott acknowledges that there is so much more research that must be done in this area, for "the body of literature on older adults and computer use is relatively small."  Lippincott provides insight into an often overlooked audience that technical communicators must learn to address.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott, Gail.  "Gray Matters:  Where Are the Technical Communicators in Research and Design for Aging Audiences?" ''IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication.''  47 (2004):  157-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa Lipus&lt;ref&gt;Of Trus Joist, a Weyerhaeuser Business in Boise, Idaho&lt;/ref&gt; argues that devoting company resources to produce adequate instructions for international users is both practical and ethical.  She also provides a brief overview of the consumer protection measures that leading U.S. trade partners have implemented.  She also presents the following guidelines for developing adequate instructions for international audiences:  1) define the scope of the instructions, 2) identify the audience, 3) describe the product's functions and limitations, 4) identify the constraints, and 5) use durable materials.  She offers tips for getting and keeping the attention of the audience.  These tips are 1) organize the information, 2) structure the information, and 3) design the page layout.  For aiding the comprehension of the readers, Lipus suggests that technical communicators write readable texts and design effective graphics.  In an effort to motivate compliance, she says to make the instructions relevant and credible and to improve user recall of the information by organizing the information into small meaningful groups and providing concise summaries and on-product reminders.  When presenting safety information, Lipus says to not only include the necessary safety messages but to also design effective safety messages.  Before distributing instructions, they must be evaluated.  She recommends testing the product and the accuracy of the instructions, communicating using means that reach users, and continuing to test and to inform users even after marketing. She explains that because the potential for making subtle but offensive errors is so high in international dealings, a language-sensitive native speaker from the target culture should always review the instructions before they are distributed to consumers.  Although Lipus provides information in analyzing and writing for an international audience regarding consumer protection, the strategies offered can be applied to document preparation in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lipus, Teresa. "International Consumer Protection:  Writing Adequate Instructions for Global Audiences". ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication''. 36 (2006):  75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenni Swenson, Helen Constantinides, and Laura Gurak, in their case study, address the problem of defining medical web site credibility and identifying the gap in web design research that fails to recognize or address specific audience needs in web site design. The information they gathered assisted the researchers in identifying and fulfilling specific audience needs, describing a framework, and presenting a case study in audience-driven Web design.  The researchers used the qualitative method of conducting a survey to find the audience of the Algenix, Inc. Web site.  Algenix is a biomedical liver disease management company.  The study showed that an audience-driven design would do more to reassure the audience that personal information would not be collected without consent as well as provide clear policies of security, privacy, and data collection.  The survey informed the researchers that the audience would also like to experience a site with minimal graphics and short download times and one that is intuitive and easy to navigate.  This study illustrates how an audience analysis should not only address what the users are able to do but also what they, as the users, would prefer.&lt;ref&gt;Swenson, Jenni, Helen Constantinides, and Laura Gurak.  "Audience-driven Web Design: An Application to Medical Web Sites". ''Technical Communication''. 43 (2002): 340-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article "Real Readers, Implied Readers, and Professional Writers: Suggested Research", Charlotte Thralls, Nancy Ror, and Helen Rothschild Ewald of Iowa State University define "real readers" versus "implied readers". The real reader is a concrete reality and determines the writer's purpose and persona.  A writer who perceives an audience as real tends to conceive of readers as living persons with specific attitudes and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the writer's task is to accommodate the real reader by analyzing this reader's needs and deferring to them.  The implied reader, on the other hand, is a mental construct or role which the actual reader is invited to enter, even though the characteristics embodied in that role may not perfectly fit his or her attitudes or reactions. When the reader is implied, the writer invents and determines the audience within the text. The researchers assert that writers must appreciate the complex interplay that may take place between the real and implied representations of the reader in every document. The researchers discuss how their study was conducted for the sole purpose of developing a hypothesis for further study: Are professional writers aware of real and implied readers; does a writer's way of perceiving a reader affect contextual development; do shifts occur in writers' conceptions of readers; are writers' perceptions of readers linked to a sense of genre and explained by principles of cognitive processing?&lt;ref&gt;Thralls, Charlotte, Nancy Roundy Byler, and Helen Rothschild Ewald. "Real Readers, Implied Readers, and Professional Writers: Suggested Research". ''Journal of Business Communication''. 25 (1998): 47-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer addiction''' can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the [[computer]] which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another clear conceptualization is made by Block, who stated that "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Block|first=J. J.|title=Issues for DSM-V: Internet Addiction|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 March 2008|volume=165|issue=3|pages=306–7|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07101556|pmid=18316427}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was expected that this new type of [[addiction]] would find a place under the compulsive disorders in the [[DSM-5]], the current edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', it is still counted as an unofficial disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Răşcanu|first=Ruxandra|author2=Marineanu, Corina|author3=Marineanu, Vasile|author4=Sumedrea, Cristian Mihai|author5=Chitu, Alexandru|title=Teenagers and their Addiction to Computer|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=May 2013|volume=78|pages=225–229|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.04.284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely '''offline computer addiction''' and '''online computer addiction'''. The term offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemmens|first=Jeroen S.|author2=Valkenburg, Patti M. |author3=Peter, Jochen |title=Development and Validation of a Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents|journal=Media Psychology|date=26 February 2009|volume=12|issue=1|pages=77–95|doi=10.1080/15213260802669458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online computer addiction, also known as [[Internet addiction]], gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pies|first=R|title=Should DSM-V Designate "Internet Addiction" a Mental Disorder?|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=2|pages=31–37|pmid=19724746|pmc=2719452|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although addiction is usually used to describe dependence on substances, addiction can also be used to describe pathological Internet use. Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual being intensely working on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet with efficient time, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yellowlees|first=Peter|author2=Marks|title=Problematic Internet use or Internet addiction?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=May 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1447–1453|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563205000439|accessdate=13 February 2014|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2005.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, simply working long hours on the computer does not necessarily mean someone is addicted.&lt;ref name="ADDICTIONS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer Addiction|url=http://www.addictions.com/computer/|publisher=ADDICTIONS.COM|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
*Being drawn by the computer as soon as one wakes up and before one goes to bed. 
*Replacing old hobbies with excessive use of the computer and using the computer as one's primary source of entertainment and procrastination
*Lacking physical exercise and/or outdoor exposure because of constant use of the computer, which could contribute to many health problems such as [[obesity]]

==Effects==
Excessive computer use may result in, or occur with:

* Lack of face to face social interaction
* [[Computer vision syndrome]]

==Causes==
[[Kimberly Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25 |title=The Relationship Between Depression and Internet Addiction |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=1 |pages=25 |year=1998 |last1=Young |first1=Kimberly S. |last2=Rogers |first2=Robert C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that previous research links internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. She states that computer addiction has significant effects socially such as low self-esteem, psychologically and occupationally which led many subjects to academic failure.

According to a Korean study on internet/computer addiction, pathological use of the internet results in negative life impacts such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of which are diagnosed as game addicts which relates to internet/computer addiction. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young's questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction  suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/109493103321640338 |title=Internet Over-Users' Psychological Profiles: A Behavior Sampling Analysis on Internet Addiction |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=143 |year=2003 |last1=Whang |first1=Leo Sang-Min |last2=Lee |first2=Sujin |last3=Chang |first3=Geunyoung }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Computers nowadays rely almost entirely on the internet and thus relevant research articles relating to internet addiction may also be relevant to computer addiction.

* '''Gaming addiction:''' a hypothetical [[behavioral addiction]] characterized by excessive or compulsive use of [[PC game|computer game]]s or [[video game]]s, which interferes with a person's [[everyday life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parents.berkeley.edu/advice/teens/gameaddiction.html|title=Computer Game Addiction|work=Berkeley Parents Network|accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game addiction may present itself as [[compulsive]] gaming, [[social isolation]], [[mood swing]]s, diminished [[imagination]], and hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauge, Marney R. and James Robert 'Paynee'|url=http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/dgentile/SRCD%20Video%20Game%20Addiction.pdf|title=Video game addiction among adolescents: Associations with academic performance and aggression|quote=Paper presented at a Society for Research in Child Development Conference, Tampa Florida|date=April 2003|accessdate=25 June 2007|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407085048/http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/dgentile/SRCD%20Video%20Game%20Addiction.pdf|archive-date=7 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanner2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19354827/|title=Is video-game addiction a mental disorder?|last=Tanner|first=Lindsey|date=22 June 2007|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social media addiction:''' Data suggest that participants use social media to fulfill their social needs, but are typically dissatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z. |last2=Tchernev |first2=J.

== Diagnostic Test==
Many studies and surveys are being conducted to measure the extent of this type of addiction. Kimberly Young has created a questionnaire based on other disorders to assess the level of addiction. It is called the Internet Addict Diagnostic Questionnaire or IADQ. The questionnaire asks users about their online usage habits as well as their feelings about their internet usage. According to the IADQ sample, Internet Addiction resembles that of a Gambling disorder. Answering positively to five out of the eight questions on the IADQ may be indicative of an online addiction. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Kimberly |title=Internet Addiction Test (IAT) Sample |url=https://www.stoeltingco.com/media/wysiwyg/IAT_web_sample.pdf |publisher=Stoelting |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term and history==

Observations about the addictiveness of computers and more specifically computer games date back at least to the mid 1970s.  Addiction and addictive behavior was common among the users of the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system at the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Dear, Chapter 21 -- Coming of Age, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D5ZBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA382 The Friendly Orange Glow], Pantheon Books, New York, 2017; see pages 381-387 for a discussion of addiction on PLATO, page 382 quotes a 1975 article from [[The Daily Illini]] that discusses the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Electronic learning|e-learning]] academic [[Nicholas Rushby]] suggested in his 1979 book, ''An Introduction to Educational Computing'', that people can be addicted to computers and suffer [[withdrawal symptoms]]. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book ''Computer Addiction''. However, Shotton concludes that the 'addicts' are not truly addicted. Dependency on computers, she argues, is better understood as a challenging and exiting pastime that can also lead to a professional career in the field. Computers do not turn gregarious, extroverted people into recluses; instead they offer introverts a source of inspiration, excitement and intellectual stimulation. Shotton's work seriously questions the legitimacy of the claim that computers cause addiction.

The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the Internet, as well the availability of the [[personal computer]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratarelli|first=Marc E.|author2=Browne, Blaine L.|author3=Johnson, Kimberly|title=The bits and bytes of computer/internet addiction: A factor analytic approach|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|date=June 1999|volume=31|issue=2|pages=305–314|doi=10.3758/BF03207725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers and the Internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium which could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive growth of individuals making use of PCs and the Internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. It was hypothesized that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, that abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and for the society in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert H. Anderson, Center for Information Revolution Analyses|title=Universal access to e-mail : feasibility and societal implications|year=1995|publisher=Rand|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=9780833023315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet where already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label "a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems" as computer or Internet addiction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
&lt;!-- (The syntax of this paragraph makes absolutely no sense. Can someone clarify all of this?) Computer addiction was used as an effective defence by one of the defendants in the Eight Legged Groove Machine hacking trial in the 1993. The victims allegedly caused £120,00 worth of damage to JANET, BT, Financial Times, European Commission sites. Expert psychiatric evidence of obsessive addiction to hacking. Held - defendant was "addicted to hacking", and lacked criminal intent. Defendant acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269279414_TWELFTH_INTERNATIONAL_SYMPOSIUM_on_ECONOMIC_CRIME_Computer_Crime_in_the_1990s_-_A_Barrister's_View__Alistair_Kelman_Computer_Crime_in_the_1990s_A_Barrister's_View|work = TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM on ECONOMIC CRIME |title=Computer Crime in the 1990s - A Barrister's View |last = Kelman|first = Alistair|date = 1994|journal = |accessdate = 16 December 2014|doi = 10.13140/2.1.3497.1201|pmid = |authorlink = }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest [[computer games]]. Press reports have furthermore noted that some [[Finnish Defence Forces]] [[conscription|conscripts]] were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life, and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is overuse of computer games or the Internet. [[Forbes]] termed this overuse "Web fixations", and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000–2005.{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[Digital technology|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last=Lorenzano|first=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as [[Refrigerator|refrigerators]], [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Günther Anders]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last=Jeronimo|first=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0824072006|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the cases of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crises]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]] - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5577">'''Data literacy''' is the ability to read, understand, create and communicate data as information. Much like [[literacy]] as a general concept, data literacy focuses on the [[Skill|competencies]] involved in working with data. 
As [[data collection]] and [[data sharing]] become routine and [[data analysis]] and [[big data]] become common ideas in the news, business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hey, A. J.|editor2=Tony Hey|editor3=Tansley, S.|editor4=Tolle, K.|title=The fourth paradigm: data-intensive scientific discovery.|year=2009|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Data Philly|url=http://opendataphilly.org/|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Na, L. |author2= Yan, Z. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Promote Data-intensive Scientific Discovery, Enhance Scientific and Technological Innovation Capability: New Model, New Method, and New Challenges Comments on" The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery|journal=Bulletin of Chinese Academy of Sciences|year=2013|volume=1|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it becomes more and more important for students, citizens, and readers to have some data literacy. 

==Related terms==

Data literacy focuses on the ability to understand and build knowledge from data, and to communicate that meaning to others. It is related to other fields, including:
* [[Statistical literacy]]
* [[Media literacy]]
* [[Information literacy]]
* [[New literacies]]
* [[Numeracy]]
* [[Transliteracy]]
* [[21st-century skills]]

== Definitions ==
* When focused on understanding scientific data, data literacy emphasizes the numeric, statistical nature of data as information, including "... understanding what data mean, including how to read graphs and charts appropriately, draw correct conclusions from data, and recognize when data are being used in misleading or inappropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Carlson, J. R. |author2=Fosmire, M. |author3=Miller, C. |author4=Sapp Nelson, M. |title=Determining Data Information Literacy Needs: A Study of Students and Research Faculty|journal=Libraries Faculty and Staff Scholarship and Research|year=2011|volume=23|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/lib_fsdocs/23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When focused on educating a population, data literacy involves "...  the knowledge of what data are, how they are collected, analyzed, visualized and shared, and is the understanding of how data are applied for benefit or detriment, within the cultural context of security and privacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Crusoe, D. |title=Data Literacy defined pro populo: To read this article, please provide a little information.|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused on citizen-design, data literacy is "... the ability to ask and answer real-world questions from large and small data sets through an inquiry process, with consideration of ethical use of data. It is based on core practical and creative skills, with the ability to extend knowledge of specialist data handling skills according to goals. These include the abilities to select, clean, analyse, visualise, critique and interpret data, as well as to communicate stories from data and to use data as part of a design process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wolff, A. |author2=Gooch, D. |author3=Cavero, J. |author4=Rashid, U. |author5=Kortuem, G. |title=Creating an understanding of data literacy for a data-driven society|journal=The Journal of Community Informatics|date=November 2016|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* When focused narrowly on the skills employers hope to find in their workers, data literacy means "... competence in finding, manipulating, managing, and interpreting data, including not just numbers but also text and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Jeanne|title=Data Is Useless Without the Skills to Analyze It|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/09/data_is_useless_without_the_skills.html|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
* The Data Journalism Handbook trains journalists in data literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Become Data Literate in 3 Simple Steps|url=http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries and Data Literacy==
As guides for finding and using information, [[librarians]] lead workshops on data literacy for students and researchers, and also work on developing their own data literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Koltay, Tibor |title=Data literacy for researchers and data librarians |journal=
Journal of Librarianship and Information Science |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0961000615616450|date=2015|volume=49|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Resources created by librarians include [[MIT]]'s Data Management and Publishing tutorial, the EDINA Research Data Management Training (MANTRA), the University of Edinburgh’s Data Library and the University of Minnesota libraries’ Data Management Course for Structural Engineers.

A '''{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard'''&lt;!-- latin expression, please preserve italics --&gt; is a custom or [[Convention (norm)|convention]] that has achieved a dominant position by public acceptance or market forces (for example, by [[first-mover advantage|early entrance to the market]]). {{Lang|la|[[De facto]]}} is a Latin phrase [[wikt:de facto|that means]] ''in fact'' (literally by or from fact) in the sense of "in practice but not necessarily ordained by law" or "in practice or actuality, but not officially established", as opposed to {{Lang|la|[[de jure]]}}.

The term {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is used in contrast with obligatory standards (also known as "{{lang|la|de jure}} standards"); or to express the dominant voluntary standard, when there is more than one standard available for the same use.

In [[social sciences]], a voluntary standard that is also a {{lang|la|de facto}} standard is a typical solution to a [[coordination problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edna Ullmann-Margalit|title=The Emergence of Norms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FLCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=5 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-106458-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a ''de facto'' standard tends to be stable in situations in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. In contrast, an enforced "{{Lang|la|de jure}} standard" is a solution to the [[prisoner's dilemma|prisoner's problem]].&lt;ref name="Ulmann" /&gt;

== Examples ==
A selection of well-known and illustrative examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} and {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards are:

* with consolidation by [[tradition|tradition of use]]:
** The [[drive side|driver's seat side]] in a given country starts as a user/industry preference, turning to a local tradition, then a [[traffic code|traffic code local norm]].
** The [[QWERTY]] system was one of several options for the layout of letters on [[typewriter]] (and later [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]) keys.  It was developed to prevent adjacent keys from jamming on early and later mechanical typewriters, often attributed to the typist's speed.&lt;ref&gt;[[QWERTY]]&lt;/ref&gt; It became a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard because it was used on the most commercially successful early typewriters and is now used on devices which have no moving parts such as [[touchscreen]]s.
** The [[MP3]] audio format started as an alternative to [[WAV]] for Internet music distribution, then replaced it&amp;nbsp;— it is now supported by the vast majority of music players, [[Portable media player|audio transport]], [[Media server|audio storage]] and noncommercial media. WAV and MP3 are also "{{Lang|la|de jure}} ISO formats".
* with consolidation by uniqueness and efficiency:
** [[HTML]] (computer file format) started as "{{Lang|la|de facto}}" (1993-1995) and became the "{{Lang|la|de jure}}" standard (1995–present day).
** [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] (computer file format) was first created in 1993 by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]].  Adobe internal standards were part of its [[software quality]] systems, but they were neither published nor coordinated by a standards body.  With the [[Acrobat Reader]] program available for free, and continued support of the format, PDF eventually became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for printable documents. In 2005, [[PDF/A]] became a [[de jure standard|&lt;span lang="la"&gt;''de jure''&lt;/span&gt; standard]] as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 19005-1:2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38920|title=ISO 19005-1:2005 - Document management -- Electronic document file format for long-term  preservation -- Part 1: Use of PDF 1.4 (PDF/A-1)|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Adobe's PDF 1.7 became [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 32000-1:2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51502|title=ISO 32000-1:2008 - Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 1: PDF 1.7|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/pdf/release_pdf_faq.html|title=Adobe - Release PDF for Industry Standardization FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of long-time {{Lang|la|de facto}} but never {{Lang|la|de jure}} standards (for computer file formats):
* [[AutoCAD DXF]]: a {{Lang|la|de facto}} [[ASCII|ASCII format]] for import and export of [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings and fragments in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, [[XML]] based standards emerged as {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards.
* [[Microsoft]] Word [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] (over all other old [[Word processor#History|PC word processors]]): one of the best known {{Lang|la|de facto}} standards. Due to the market dominance of Word, it is supported by all office applications that intend to compete with it, typically by [[reverse engineering]] the undocumented file format. Microsoft has repeatedly internally changed the file specification between versions of Word to suit their own needs, while continuing to reuse the same file extension identifier for different versions.
* [[FITS]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] file formats, commonly used in science and engineering, with FITS traditionally used in [[astronomy]].
* [[TeX]] typesetting system, commonly used in creating scientific articles and reports for publication (in fact many journals require the publication to be fully written in TeX).

Other examples:
*Most American-made [[spark plugs]] require a {{frac|13|16}}-inch socket to remove or install. 
* The {{convert|1/2|in|mm|adj=on}} spacing of the rollers in a [[bicycle chain]].
* The [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC). By one year after its 1981 release, [[John Dvorak]] described the PC as rapidly becoming a "{{Lang|la|de facto}} standard microcomputer".&lt;ref name="zussman19820823"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Let's keep those systems open | work=InfoWorld | date=1982-08-23 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Zussman, John Unger | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s, it gained a large share of the personal computer market. Because of the great [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market]], competing products like the [[Rainbow 100]] were eventually withdrawn.
* Interpreted programming languages such as [[PHP]] that have multiple implementations tend to also have a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard. In PHP's case the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard is the binaries available from php.net, rather than the [[Phalanger (compiler)|Phalanger]] implementation for example.
* Use of programming languages [[R]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in data science and other science disciplines, other than computer science, where automated analysis of data is required, without system being too complicated for a persons not being professionals.

Various connectors and interconnect standards - despite being formalized and standardized, almost no product is required by law or other legal standard to use them. Examples:
* [[Phone connector (audio)|Phone connector]] (3.5mm jack), [[RCA connector|RCA]] and [[XLR connector|XLR]] connectors, used in audio industry, for connecting audio equipment, headphones, mixing consoles, microphones (often with [[phantom power]] with 48 volts in most applications), stage lightning, etc.
* [[MIDI]] connection (using so called [[DIN connector]]), electrical and protocol standard for connecting musical instruments, synthesizers, drum machines, sequencers and some audio equipment, as well [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ing them.
* [[DMX512]] (commonly just DMX) with [[XLR connector]] to control and sometimes power stage and venue lights, effects, smoke machines, laser projectors and sometimes pyrotechnics.
* [[PCI Express]] electrical and mechanical interface, and interconnect protocol used in PC computers, desktops, laptops, server, and industrial applications.
* [[GPIB]], also known as [[IEEE-488]], multi-device bus protocol, mechanical and electronic interface commonly found in electronic test equipment, i.e. digital [[multimeter]]s, [[oscilloscope|oscilloscopes]], initially created by Hewlett [[Hewlett-Packard]] as HP-IP. Commonly used with [[SCPI]] protocol.
* [[HDMI]], [[Display Port]], [[VGA]] for video, [[RS-232]] for low bandwidth serial communication.
* [[USB]] for high speed serial interface in computers and for powering or charging low power external devices (like mobile phones, headphones, portable hard drives) usually using micro USB plug and socket.
* [[Banana plugs]] in low frequency voltage and current measurements.
* [[BNC connector|BNC]] for medium frequency signal in electronic engineering testing (commonly used by signal generators, oscilloscopes, advanced multimeters and [[LCR meter|LCR meters]], [[Network analyzer (electrical)|vector network analysers]]) and sometimes in video signal (analog and digital) delivery between devices in studios and other professional settings. 
* [[AMP Incorporated|AMP]]'s AMP MATE-N-LOK / [[Molex connector|Molex]]'s Standard .093" Pin Power plug and socket, commonly used on hard drives, and other medium power devices both in PC, server, industrial applications, and others where standardized power connector for 5V and 12V is required, and off the shelf [[Power supply unit|PSU]] can be used. In embedded applications it is usually replaced with smaller square connector, that is easier to connect.
* 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pin spacing on many electronic components, including [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], [[Dual in-line- package#Single in-line|SIL]] packages, [[header connector]]s, and many more. The standard spacing enable use of these devices in prototyping boards and standardized sockets.
* [[4-20mA]] current loop standard used by sensors, transducers, amplifiers, transmission lines, control and measurement equipment.
* 3.5 inch and 2.5 inch (actual dimensions are different) hard drive standard sizes.
* [[19-inch rack]] standards for telecommunication, server, storage, audio, music, video and power equipment.
* [[ATX]] motherboard, back plane and power standards (but the intention of ATX design was to reduce number of standards, so it was not established by convention, but by biggest PC hardware and components manufacturers at the time).
* many more connectors and cables, like standardized ribbon cables medium speed and power connection between boards and devices; use of [[Registered jack|RJ45 jack]] in Ethernet switches for management purposes (instead of another de facto standard, [[RS-232]] connector); SD and microSD cards for removable storage in mobile applications like photo cameras, video recorders, phones; [[AA batteries]].

Materials and units of packaging:
* [[Solder|Soldering alloys]] in electronics, like Sn60Pb40.
* [[Aluminium alloy]]s, with most common being [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061]].
* Volumes, weights and quantities of common consumables usually follow round number of base legal units, i.e. in Europe milk is usually sold in 1 litter containers, and eggs are sold as quantity of 6.
* [[Intermodal container|Intermodal]] 48-foot container.

== Standards battles ==
There are many examples of {{Lang|la|de facto}} consolidation (of a standard) by market forces and [[Invisible hand|competition]], in a [[two-sided market]], after a [[format war|dispute]]. Examples:

* [[Alternating current]] over [[direct current]]: see [[War of the currents]].
* [[VHS]] over [[Betamax]] (see  [[videotape format war]]): when the VHS format for [[videotape]] recording was introduced, other recording formats were already available in the market. Regardless of whether Betamax was superior from a technical point of view or not, the VHS format won the [[format war]] due to superior marketing tactics by its proponents. The market could not support two competing formats; VHS became the {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard and Betamax was eventually withdrawn.
* [[Blu-ray]] over [[HD DVD]] (see [[high definition optical disc format war]]).

Examples of standards that are "in dispute" for turns {{Lang|la|de facto}}:
* [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]'s [[OpenDocument]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[Linux]] users ([[Apache OpenOffice]], [[LibreOffice]], [[Calligra]], [[KOffice]] et al. use it as default file format)) ''vs'' Microsoft's [[Office Open XML]] format (a {{Lang|la|de facto}} standard for [[MS-Windows]] and Mac users).
* [[Adobe Flash]] ''vs'' [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG), for [[vector graphics]] [[web page]] [[animation]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">'''Digital Fine Contrast''' is a [[contrast (vision)|contrast]]-enhancing display technology introduced in 2006 by [[LG Display]]. It is used in the company's "Flatron" line of [[TFT LCD|TFT]] monitors and implements a 'smart function' whereby it dynamically detects the characteristics of each frame to be displayed and automatically adjusts its contrast to obtain a sharper and more vivid image. The system comprises three units: ACR (Auto Contents Recognition), DCE (Digital Contrast Enhancer) and DCM (Digital Contrast Mapper).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gadgetell.com/2006/02/lg-increases-their-standard-contrast-ratio-to-16001/ "LG increases their standard contrast ratio to 1600:1"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial announcement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lge.com/about/press_release/detail/PRO%7CNEWS%5EPRE%7CMENU_20075_PRE%7CMENU.jhtml Press release: "LG Unveils the Cutting-edge 'Digital Fine Contrast (DFC)' Technology"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810155943/http://www.lge.com/about/press_release/detail/PRO%7CNEWS%5EPRE%7CMENU_20075_PRE%7CMENU.jhtml |date=2007-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed monitors with DFC could achieve a contrast ratio of 1600:1, while later products have been presented as capable of ratios even as high as 2,000,000:1, and there are SAMSUNG LCD TV sets that claim 500,000:1 with LCD monitors claiming 5,000,000:1.

A '''DIP reader''' (Document Insertion Processor) is an electronic device for reading an [[Magnetic stripe card|electronically encoded card]] that is inserted and then removed from the device.

A typical dip reader is used for reading credit cards where the [[data]] are either encoded on a magnetic stripe or an internal [[Integrated circuit|computer chip]]. The magnetic stripe on a card is typically read as the card is extracted.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} If the card is a [[smart card]], then the data transfer typically takes place when the card is fully inserted. In this case, the card is held while [[data transfer]] is taking place.

'''ID2020''' is a nonprofit [[Public-private-partnership|public-private partnership]] committed to improving lives through digital identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/admin/hcspeeches/59d1f3b77/opening-statement-68th-session-executive-committee-high-commissioners-programme.html|title=Opening statement at the 68th session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An estimated 1.1 billion people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/id4d-dataset|title=Identification for Development Global Dataset {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, including many millions of children, women and refugees, globally lack any form of officially recognized identification. Without an identity, individuals are often invisible – unable to vote, access healthcare, open a bank account, or receive an education – and bear higher risk for trafficking. Without accurate population data, public and private organizations struggle to broadly and accurately deliver the most basic human services.

In 2017, ID2020 established an alliance to bring together governments, public and private sector organizations, including [[Accenture]], [[Microsoft]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Hyperledger]], and [https://www.unicc.org/Pages/Home.aspx UNICC]. The alliance model enables a synchronized approach to digital identity initiatives by enabling diverse stakeholders to work collaboratively and by coordinating funding to support high-impact projects.

ID2020’s mission supports the [http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ UN Sustainable Development Goal] Target 16.9&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/|title=Peace, justice and strong institutions - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. which aims to provide legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. As proof of one’s identity is a prerequisite to social and economic inclusion in the modern world, an identity must be broadly recognized by both the public- and private-sector organizations with which an individual may interact.

ID2020 principles for identity focus on protecting the individual and giving the individual control over their own identity and associated data. These principles apply to any project ID2020 may undertake.
# Personal: Unique to you and you only
# Persistent: Lives with you from birth to death
# Private: Only you can give permission to use data
# Portable: Accessible anywhere you happen to be

== History ==
ID2020 was launched in 2014 by John Edge, a social entrepreneur specializing in financial technology and digital identity.

ID2020’s initial funding came from [[Rockefeller Foundation|The Rockefeller Foundation]], with further support provided by Accenture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13158">[[Sony]] regularly released [[firmware]] updates for its [[PlayStation Portable]] system, and encouraged PSP owners to upgrade the [[PlayStation Portable system software|PSP system software]]. To increase system software upgrades, Sony encoded their games so that some of them require newer versions of the system software. This is a list of PSP games having such requirements. All system software updates are backwards-compatible; that is, all games that work on system software version 1.5 will work on version 2.0, and so on.

== Other ==
Some [[Nikon Coolpix]] cameras which are not advertised as supporting a RAW image format can actually produce usable raw files if switched to a maintenance mode.&lt;ref&gt;http://e2500.narod.ru/raw_format_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Note that switching to this mode can invalidate a camera's guarantee. Nikon models with this capability:

E700, E800, E880, E900, E950, E990, E995, E2100, E2500, E3700, E4300, E4500.

Some [[Canon PowerShot]] cameras with DiGiC II and certain DiGiC III image processors which are not advertised as supporting a RAW format can actually produce usable raw files with an unofficial open-source firmware add-on by some users.&lt;ref&gt;See [[DIGIC#Custom firmware]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nokia N900]] mobile phone has an add on app "Fcam", which allows capture and saving of RAW files in Adobe's DNG format (along with other advanced features usually found in DSLRs).
In 2013, Nokia launched [[Nokia Lumia 1520]] and [[Nokia Lumia 1020]] [[smartphones]] with DNG RAW format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/22/nokia-bringing-raw-imaging-lumia-1520-and-1020/ |title=Nokia bringing RAW photography to the Lumia 1520 and 1020 |date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Note 7, Galaxy S6 Edge+, S7 and S7 Edge also support RAW image capture. Not to mention LG G4, LG G5, iPhone 6s (Plus), iPhone SE, iPhone 7 (Plus) iPad Pro and some other modern phones - OnePlus One, OnePlus Two, OnePlus 3(T), etc.

This is a '''list of [[handheld game console]]s''', portable [[video game console]]s with a built-in screen and game controls and separate games. It does not include [[PDA]]s, [[smartphone]]s, or [[tablet computer]]s; while those devices are often capable of playing games, they are not primarily video game consoles.

For handheld [[dedicated console]]s, which only play games built into the system, see [[list of dedicated consoles]].

For [[Home video game console|home video game consoles]], see [[List of home video game consoles]].

Though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler, the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.

Slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as aviation or finance typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations common to those fields.

At its simplest, each number to be multiplied is represented by a length on a sliding ruler. As the rulers each have a logarithmic scale, it is possible to align them to read the sum of the logarithms, and hence calculate the product, of the two numbers.

The Reverend [[William Oughtred]] and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on [[logarithms]] by [[John Napier]]. Before the advent of the [[electronic calculator]], it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and [[engineering]]. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as computers were being gradually introduced; but around 1974 the handheld electronic scientific calculator made them largely obsolete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Basic concepts ==
[[File:slide rule cursor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cursor on a slide rule]]
In its most basic form, the slide rule uses two [[logarithmic scale]]s to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate slide rules allow other calculations, such as [[square root]]s, [[exponential function|exponentials]], logarithms, and [[trigonometric function]]s.

Scales may be grouped in decades, which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 10&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus single decade scales C and D range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales A and B range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule.

In general, mathematical calculations are performed by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the [[product (mathematics)|product]], [[quotient]], or other calculated result.

The user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. [[Scientific notation]] is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.

Most slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length, aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.

Some slide rules ("duplex" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only ("simplex" rules). A sliding [[Wikt:cursor|cursor]] with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.

== Operation ==
[[File:pocket slide rule.jpg|frame|center|This slide rule is positioned to yield several values: From C scale to D scale (multiply by 2), from D scale to C scale (divide by 2), A and B scales (multiply and divide by 4), A and D scales (squares and square roots).]]

=== Multiplication ===
A logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules &lt;math&gt;\log(xy) = \log(x) + \log(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log(x/y) = \log(x) - \log(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Moving the top scale to the right by a distance of &lt;math&gt;\log(x)&lt;/math&gt;, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom, aligns each number &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, at position &lt;math&gt;\log(y)&lt;/math&gt; on the top scale, with the number at position &lt;math&gt;\log(x) + \log(y)&lt;/math&gt; on the bottom scale. Because &lt;math&gt;\log(x) + \log(y) = \log(xy)&lt;/math&gt;, this position on the bottom scale gives &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, the product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. For example, to calculate 3×2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the "1" are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values:

[[File:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|550px]]

Operations may go "off the scale;" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively dividing by 10 (by subtracting the full length of the C-scale) and then multiplying by 7, as in the illustration below:

[[File:slide rule example3.svg]]

Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated (2/10)×7=0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:
# Use the double-decade scales A and B.
# Use the folded scales. In this example, set the left 1 of C opposite the 2 of D. Move the cursor to 7 on CF, and read the result from DF.
# Use the CI inverted scale. Position the 7 on the CI scale above the 2 on the D scale, and then read the result off of the D scale below the 1 on the CI scale. Since 1 occurs in two places on the CI scale, one of them will always be on-scale.
# Use both the CI inverted scale and the C scale. Line up the 2 of CI with the 1 of D, and read the result from D, below the 7 on the C scale.
# Using a circular slide rule.

Method 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.

=== Division ===
The illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.

[[File:slide rule example4.svg]]

=== Other operations ===
In addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical [[function (mathematics)|function]]s encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular were [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]], usually [[sine]] and [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]], [[common logarithm]] (log{{small|10}}) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), [[natural logarithm]] (ln) and [[exponential function|exponential]] (''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'') scales. Some rules include a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating [[hyperbolic functions]]. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| A, B || two-decade logarithmic scales, used for finding square roots and squares of numbers
|-
| C, D || single-decade logarithmic scales
|-
| K || three-decade logarithmic scale, used for finding cube roots and cubes of numbers
|-
| CF, DF || "folded" versions of the C and D scales that start from [[Pi|π]] rather than from unity; these are convenient in two cases. First when the user guesses a product will be close to 10 but is not sure whether it will be slightly less or slightly more than 10, the folded scales avoid the possibility of going off the scale. Second, by making the start π rather than the square root of 10, multiplying or dividing by π (as is common in science and engineering formulas) is simplified.

The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/circular-man2.html|title=instruction manual |pages= 7–8|accessdate=March 14, 2007|work=sphere.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roots and powers ====
There are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.

For &lt;math&gt;x^y&lt;/math&gt; problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with ''x'' on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find ''y'' on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with ''x'' on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If ''y'' is "off the scale," locate &lt;math&gt;x^{y/2}&lt;/math&gt; and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.

To extract a cube root using a slide rule with only C/D and A/B scales, align 1 on the B cursor with the base number on the A scale (taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the A scale). Slide the cursor until the number on the D scale which is against 1 on the C cursor is the same as the number on the B cursor which is against the base number on the A scale. (Examples: A 8, B 2, C 1, D 2; A 27, B 3, C 1, D 3.)

==== Trigonometry ====
The S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.

For angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as &lt;math&gt;k\sin x&lt;/math&gt; can be read directly from ''x'' on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at&amp;nbsp;''k''. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/[[radian]]. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.

Many slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models, late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called ''decitrig'' models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.

==== Logarithms and exponentials ====
Base-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.

==== Addition and subtraction ====
Slide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquark.com/2005/01/slide-rule-tricks.html|title=AntiQuark: Slide Rule Tricks|work=antiquark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:

:&lt;math&gt;x + y = \left(\frac{x}{y} + 1\right) y.&lt;/math&gt;

For subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:

:&lt;math&gt;x - y = \left(\frac{x}{y} - 1\right) y.&lt;/math&gt;

This method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the [[logarithmic number system]] in specialized computer applications like the [[Gravity Pipe]] (GRAPE) supercomputer and [[hidden Markov models]].

The second method utilizes a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.

== Physical design ==

=== Standard linear rules ===
[[File:Teaching sliderule comparison.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} teaching slide rule compared to a normal sized model]]
The width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common "10-inch" models are actually 25&amp;nbsp;cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5&amp;nbsp;inches. Models a couple of metres wide were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.tbullock.com/sliderule.html

|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two [[significant figures]], and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.

Various other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called "Darmstadt" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often "split" to get higher accuracy.

=== Circular slide rules ===
Circular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors, and another with a free dish and one cursor. The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.

The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by [[pi|π]]). For example, a 10&amp;nbsp;cm circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a 31.4&amp;nbsp;cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate "off-scale" calculations, because the scales were designed to "wrap around"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.&lt;ref&gt;At least one circular rule, a 1931 Gilson model, sacrificed some of the scales usually found in slide rules in order to obtain additional resolution in multiplication and division. It functioned through the use of a spiral C scale, which was claimed to be 50 feet and readable to five significant figures. See http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/gilson/gilson-manual2.jpg.

Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than "split" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale. Around 1970, an inexpensive model from B. C. Boykin (Model 510) featured 20 scales, including 50-inch C-D (multiplication) and log scales. The RotaRule featured a friction brake for the cursor.

The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.

One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the [[E6B]]. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with [[dead reckoning]]. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called "prayer wheel" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.

Proportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to calculate [[aspect ratio]]s. Lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window. They are not as common since the advent of computerized layout, but {{cns|are still made and used.&lt;!-- please add {{as of}} or equivalent when sourcing --&gt;|date=March 2018}}

In 1952, Swiss watch company [[Breitling SA|Breitling]] introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a "navigation computer", featured [[airspeed]], [[rate of climb|rate]]/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer—[[nautical mile]] and gallon—liter fuel amount conversion functions.

=== Cylindrical slide rules ===
There are two main types of cylindrical slide rules: those with helical scales such as the Fuller, the [[Otis King]] and the [[Bygrave slide rule]], and those with bars, such as the Thacher and some Loga models. In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.

=== Materials ===
Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.

In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong, and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other [[resin]]. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful{{cn|date=April 2018}} slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} For painted slide rules, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== History ==
[[File:oughtred.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Oughtred]] (1575–1660), inventor of the slide rule]]
The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after [[John Napier]]'s publication of the concept of the [[logarithm]]. In 1620 [[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eq5kDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of Mathematics|last=Smith|first=David E.|date=1958|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486204307|location=|pages=205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In c. 1622, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k43Q9RHuGXgC&amp;lpg=PT831&amp;dq=William%20Oughtred%20circular%20rule&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT831#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Oughtred%20circular%20rule&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton|last=Applebaum|first=Wilbur|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135582555|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Slide Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over [[Scientific priority|priority]], with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.

In 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.

In 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a "polyphase" rule.

In 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.

In 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a "sliding rule" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.

In 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a nautical slide rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.&lt;ref&gt;"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule", ''The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine'', April 1845, p. 187 and Plate XX-B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern form ===
[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Engineer using a slide rule, with mechanical calculator in background, mid 20th century]]
A more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Amédée Mannheim]], "who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery." It was around this time that engineering became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe–but not in the United States.  There, Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by [[Keuffel and Esser Co.]] of New York.&lt;ref name="fn_3"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K&amp;EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |title=The Log-Log Duplex Decitrig Slide Rule No. 4081: A Manual |publisher=Keuffel &amp; Esser |first1=Lyman M. |last1=Kells |first2=Willis F. |last2=Kern |first3=James R. |last3=Bland |year=1943 |page=92 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214020502/http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K%26EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_4"&gt;''The Polyphase Duplex Slide Rule, A Self-Teaching Manual'', Breckenridge, 1922, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical work also required precise computations, and, in 19th-century Germany, a steel slide rule about two meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession in the same way the stethoscope is that of the medical profession.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]] bought two ''Nestler'' slide rules in the 1930s. Ten years later he brought them with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War II to work on the American space effort. Throughout his life he never used any other slide rule. He used his two Nestlers while heading the [[NASA]] program that landed a man on the moon in July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The first pocket calculator that could [[Calculator#Pocket calculators|replace the slide rule]] was the [[HP35]] introduced in 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium [[Pickett Incorporated|Pickett]]-brand slide rules were carried on [[Project Apollo]] space missions. The model N600-ES owned by [[Buzz Aldrin]] that flew with him to the moon on [[Apollo 11]] was sold at auction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://historical.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=669&amp;lotIdNo=41035 | title=Lot 25368 Buzz Aldrin's Apollo 11 Slide Rule - Flown to the Moon. ... 2007 September Grand Format Air &amp; Space Auction #669 | publisher=Heritage Auctions | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model N600-ES taken along on [[Apollo 13]] in 1970 is owned by the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19840160000 | title=Slide Rule, 5-inch, Pickett N600-ES, Apollo 13 | publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, a common sight on campuses even into the mid-1970s. Until the advent of the pocket digital calculator, students also might keep a ten- or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office&lt;ref&gt;Charles Overton Harris, ''Slide rule simplified'', American Technical Society, 1961, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.

In 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on ''[[prosthaphaeresis]]'', an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Specialized calculators ===
Slide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., but some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone &amp; Sons 1892 catalog lists a "Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge", a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.

There were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications; for example, the [[actinograph]] of [[Hurter and Driffield]] was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] from time of day, time of year, and latitude.

Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the [[Fisher Controls]] company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106031649/http://www.natgasedu.com/vm004.html |archivedate=6 January 2010 |title=Fisher sizing rules |accessdate=2009-10-06 |work=natgasedu.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot balloon slide rules were used by meteorologists in weather services to determine the upper wind velocities from an ascending hydrogen or helium filled pilot balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilotballoon.com/slide.htm|title=Pilot Balloon Slide Rules|work=www.pilotballoon.com|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule "chassis" with an aluminium body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.

The [[E6B|E6-B]] is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigators.

Circular slide rules to estimate ovulation dates and fertility are known as ''wheel calculators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767050412331312200 | pmid=15061314 | title=Circle of time: errors in the use of the pregnancy wheel | journal=Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine | date=2003 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=370–372 | first=M.

=== Decline ===
[[File:TI-30 LED.png|150px|thumb|The [[TI-30]] scientific calculator was introduced for under US$25 in 1976 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|25|1976|r=2}}|0}} adjusted for inflation), signaling the end of the slide rule era.]]
The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but rare resource in the 1950s, became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. (See [[History of computing hardware (1960s–present)]].)

Another step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific calculators. The first included the [[Wang Laboratories]] [[Wang LOCI-2|LOCI-2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/wangloci.html|title=The Wang LOCI-2|work=oldcalculatormuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang Ad 1966"&gt;{{cite journal

The HP used the [[CORDIC]] (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm,&lt;ref name="Volder_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jack E. |last=Volder |title=The Birth of CORDIC |journal=Journal of VLSI Signal Processing |issn=0922-5773 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=101–105 |date=June 2000 |url=http://late-dpedago.urv.cat/site_media/papers/fulltext_2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064804/http://late-dpedago.urv.cat/site_media/papers/fulltext_2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-04 |access-date=2016-01-02 |doi=10.1023/a:1008110704586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.

As with mainframe computing, the availability of these machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule until cheap hand held scientific electronic calculators became available in the mid-1970s, at which point, it rapidly declined. 
The pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard [[HP-35]] scientific calculator was the first handheld device of its type, but it cost [[United States dollar|US$]]395 in 1972. This was justifiable for some engineering professionals but too expensive for most students. 
By 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and, by 1976, the [[TI-30]] scientific calculator was sold for less than $25.

Most people find slide rules difficult to learn and use. Even during their heyday, they never caught on with the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled," ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "The difficulty of learning to use slide rules discouraged their use among the hoi polloi. Yes, the occasional grocery store manager figured discounts on a slipstick, and this author once caught his high school English teacher calculating stats for trifecta horse-race winners on a slide rule during study hall. But slide rules never made it into daily life because you could not do simple addition and subtraction with them, not to mention the difficulty of keeping track of the decimal point. Slide rules remained tools for techies."&lt;/ref&gt; Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, George H. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KIyAn_jTGUYC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;ots=QaPDD5V0BD&amp;dq=calculator%20%22slide%20rule%22%20training&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q=slide%20rule&amp;f=false "Problem-based learning and the three C's of technology,"] ''The Power of Problem-Based Learning'', Barbara Duch, Susan Groh, Deborah Allen, eds., Stylus Publishing, LLC, 2001. "Numerical computations in freshman physics and chemistry were excruciating; however, this did not seem to be the case for those students fortunate enough to already own a calculator. I vividly recall that at the end of 1974, the students who were still using slide rules were given an additional 15 minutes on the final examination to compensate for the computational advantage afforded by the calculator, hardly adequate compensation in the opinions of the remaining slide rule practitioners."&lt;/ref&gt; This led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions, these approximations could lead to inaccuracies and mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled," ''Scientific American,'' May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "With computation moving literally at a hand's pace and the lack of precision a given, mathematicians worked to simplify complex problems. Because linear equations were friendlier to slide rules than more complex functions were, scientists struggled to linearize mathematical relations, often sweeping high-order or less significant terms under the computational carpet. So a car designer might calculate gas consumption by looking mainly at an engine's power, while ignoring how air friction varies with speed. Engineers developed shortcuts and rules of thumb. At their best, these measures led to time savings, insight and understanding. On the downside, these approximations could hide mistakes and lead to gross errors."&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack.&lt;ref&gt;Stoll, Cliff. "When Slide Rules Ruled", ''Scientific American'', May 2006, [http://sliderulemuseum.com/Ephemera/ScientificAmericanMay2006_SR_byCliffStoll.pdf pp. 80–87]. "One effect was that users felt close to the numbers, aware of rounding-off errors and systematic inaccuracies, unlike users of today's computer-design programs. Chat with an engineer from the 1950s, and you will most likely hear a lament for the days when calculation went hand-in-hand with deeper comprehension. Instead of plugging numbers into a computer program, an engineer would understand the fine points of loads and stresses, voltages and currents, angles and distances. Numeric answers, crafted by hand, meant problem solving through knowledge and analysis rather than sheer number crunching."&lt;/ref&gt; A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed.

A slide rule requires the user to separately compute the [[order of magnitude]] of the answer in order to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5 × 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as 1,500,000 × 0.03 (which equals 45,000). This separate calculation is less likely to lead to extreme calculation errors, but forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short-term memory (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).

The typical [[arithmetic precision]] of a slide rule is about three [[significant digits]], compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of [[false precision]].

When performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.

Being entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on [[grid (electricity)|grid electricity]] or batteries. However, mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.

Many sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The [[E6B]] circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT is a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenwatch.com/en-us/watches/watch-detail/?model=JY0000-53E#filters=0000-53E|title=Citizen Watch Company – Citizen Eco-Drive / US, Canada, UK, IrelandCitizen Watch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=citizenwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular collectible model is the [[Keuffel &amp; Esser]] ''Deci-Lon'', a premium scientific and engineering slide rule available both in a ten-inch (25&amp;nbsp;cm) "regular" (''Deci-Lon 10'') and a five-inch "pocket" (''Deci-Lon 5'') variant. Another prized American model is the eight-inch (20&amp;nbsp;cm) Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, [[Faber-Castell]]'s high-end models are the most popular among collectors.

Although a great many slide rules are circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on [[:Category:online auction websites|online auction sites]] are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors' web sites. The Keuffel and Esser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic, because the end-pieces on the cursors, made of celluloid, tend to chemically break down over time.

There are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules. The Concise Company of Tokyo, which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in July 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Various slide rule simulator apps are available for Android and iOS-based smart phones and tablets.

Specialized slide rules such as the E6B used in aviation, and gunnery slide rules used in [[Gun laying|laying artillery]] are still used though no longer on a routine basis. These rules are used as part of the teaching and instruction process as in learning to use them the student also learns about the principles behind the calculations, it also allows the student to be able to use these instruments as a back up in the event that the modern electronics in general use fail.

The '''Sony Watchman''' is a line of portable [[Handheld television|pocket televisions]] trademarked and produced by [[Sony]]. The line was introduced in 1982 and discontinued in 2000.

==FD-210==
The initial model was introduced in 1982 as the FD-210, which had a grayscale five [[centimeter]] display. The device weighed around 650 [[gram]]s, with a measurement of 87 x 198 x 33 [[millimeter]]s. The device was sold in Japan with a price of 54,800 [[yen]]. Roughly two years later, in 1984, the device was introduced to [[Europe]] and [[North America]].

==Later releases==
[[File:Sony watchman models.jpg|thumb|Various models of Sony Watchmen]]
Sony manufactured more than 65 models of the Watchman before its discontinuation in 2000. Upon the release of further models after the FD-210, the display size increased, and new features were introduced. The FD-3, introduced in 1987, had a built-in digital clock. The FD-30, introduced in 1984 had a built-in AM/FM Stereo radio. The FD-40/42/44/45 were among the largest Watchmen, utilizing a 4" CRT display. The FD-40 introduced a single composite A/V input. The FD-45, introduced in 1986, was water-resistant. In 1988/1989, the FDL 330S color Watchman TV/Monitor with LCD display was introduced. In 1990, the FDL-310, a Watchman with a color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] was introduced. The FD-280/285, made from 1990 to 1994, was the last Watchman to use a black and white CRT display. One of the last Watchmen was the FDL-22 introduced in 1998, which featured an ergonomic body which made it easier to hold, and introduced Sony's ''Straptenna'', where the wrist strap served as the antenna.

==Legacy==
Due to the switch of television broadcasts to digital, most models of the Sony Watchman have lost their usefulness, because they now require to be connected to a digital converter box.

==Marketing and media==
A model of the Sony Watchman is seen multiple times in the film [[Rain Man]].

[[File:Foglet.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a 100-micrometer foglet]]
'''Utility fog''' (coined by Dr. [[John Storrs Hall]] in 1993&lt;ref&gt;John Storrs Hall, "Utility Fog: A Universal Physical Substance," in ''Vision-21: Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering in the Era of Cyberspace'', [[Geoffrey A. Landis|G. A. Landis]], ed., NASA Publication CP-10129, pp. 115-126 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a hypothetical collection of tiny [[robot]]s that can replicate a physical structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/utility-fog-the-stuff-that-dreams-are-made-of Utility Fog: The Stuff that Dreams Are Made Of],  Dr. J. Storrs Hall, July 5, 2001, KurzweilAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/what-i-want-to-be-when-i-grow-up-is-a-cloud What I want to be when I grow up, is a cloud], J. Storrs Hall, July 6, 2001, KurzweilAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pivot.net/~jpierce/aspects_of_ufog.htm On Certain Aspects of Utility Fog] by Dr. J. Storrs Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lego"&gt;[http://www.islandone.org/MMSG/9609lego.htm LEGOs (TM) to the Stars] The Assembler, Volume 4, Number 3 Third Quarter, 1996, Tihamer Toth-Fejel&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it is a form of [[self-reconfiguring modular robot]]ics.

==Conception==

Hall thought of it as a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] replacement for car [[seatbelt]]s. The robots would be [[microscopic]], with extending arms reaching in several different directions, and could perform [[three-dimensional]] [[crystal structure|lattice]] reconfiguration. Grabbers at the ends of the arms would allow the robots (or '''foglets''') to mechanically link to one another and share both information and energy, enabling them to act as a continuous substance with mechanical and optical properties that could be varied over a wide range. Each foglet would have substantial computing power, and would be able to communicate with its neighbors. 

In the original application as a replacement for seatbelts, the [[swarm robotics|swarm of robots]] would be widely spread out, and the arms loose, allowing air flow between them. In the event of a collision the arms would lock into their current position, as if the air around the passengers had abruptly frozen solid. The result would be to spread any impact over the entire surface of the passenger's body. 

While the foglets would be micro-scale, construction of the foglets would require full [[molecular nanotechnology]].  Hall suggests that each bot may be in the shape of a [[dodecahedron]] with 12 arms extending outwards.  Each arm would have four [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]. The foglets' bodies would be made of [[aluminum oxide]] rather than [[combustible]] [[diamond]] to avoid creating a [[fuel air explosive]].&lt;ref name="lego"/&gt;

Hall and his correspondents soon realised that utility fog could be manufactured en masse to occupy the entire atmosphere of a planet and replace any physical instrumentality necessary to human life. By foglets exerting concerted force an object or human could be carried from location to location. Virtual buildings could be constructed and dismantled within moments, enabling the replacement of existing cities and roads with farms and gardens. While molecular nanotech might also replace the need for biological bodies, utility fog would remain a useful peripheral with which to perform physical engineering and maintenance tasks. Thus, utility fog also came to be known as ″the machine of the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J. Storrs Hall | title=Utility Fog: the machine of the future | journal=Nanotechnol.

'''Yabacon Valley''' (YV) is a nickname for an area within [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]]. Yaba is a suburb of [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] and located at the mainland of the Lagos. This area is already growing as Nigeria’s technology hub and cluster of hundreds of banking institutions, educational institutions, technology and [[startup company|startup]] companies which steadily attracts angel investors, venture capitalists, enthusiasts and media people from all over the world. This cluster is the major reason many technology firms are considering opening up shops in Yaba.&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/yaba-joins-race-to-become-africas-silicon-valley/#.U7sbv5RdU8o|title=Yaba to become Africa's Silicon Valley|website=BusinessDay|author= Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to the region is the [[Lagos Lagoon]] which lies on its south-western side, it empties into the Atlantic via Lagos Harbor, a main channel through the heart of the city, 0.5&amp;nbsp;km to 1&amp;nbsp;km wide and 10&amp;nbsp;km long. The term originally was born from an unintentional act of an absent mind, manipulating the [[Silicon Valley]] name to create a nick version for this cluster while writing a story title.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"&gt;[http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/] from thebusinessaim.com.ng&lt;/ref&gt; More so, due to the [[lagoon]] near this region, the term Silicon lagoon has also been used to refer to this cluster although this is yet to stick and its origin or creator is unknown.

Regardless of the tech clusters in [[Africa]], Yabacon Valley (YV) or Silicon lagoon — whichever name you chose to call it — continues to be a leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, buoyed by the country’s budding, technology-savvy middle-class and massive online population of 45 million internet users. Nigeria’s fledgling technology start-up scene is witnessing a flurry of activities in the frame of new [[investment]] drive, acquisitions, strategic partnerships as well as plans to establish more incubation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/10/venture-capitalists-give-push-to-nigerias-technology-start-ups/#.U9tiSaN_3IU |title=Venture capitalists Propel Nigeria’s tech start-ups|publisher=BusinessDay|author=Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Yabacon Valley encompasses all Yaba Local Council Development area which was carved out of the old Lagos Mainland Local Government created in 1977 as a separate local government following the national reform of Local [[government]] in September 1976. The Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city [[council]] which administered the Lagos [[Metropolitan area|Metropolitan]] city consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former Lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it. The present Yaba Local Council Area has the look of an urban setting; some areas however mirror rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yabacon Valley is a development, a commercial nerve center for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

==Origin of term==
It is not known if the term ''Yabacon Valley'' has been mentioned or used in reference of this tech cluster in the past, but its first published use is credited to [http://www.thebusinessaim.com.ng The Business Aim], an online publishing platform with focus on business, strategy, innovation, startup culture and everything new. According to Google search results, the name was first used by ''Blaise Aboh'', then an award-winning editor, now [[Data analysis|Data Analysis]]/Design Lead and Founding Partner at [http://www.orodataviz.com Orodata Science Nigeria] a [[Civic technology]] organization as part of a title for an [http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/ article] on reasons for the arrival of startup accelerators, and also to announce the emergence of a new player named [http://passionincubator.ng Passion Incubator] in Yaba technology [[ecosystem]]. The article is dated 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"/&gt; The term is still not widely known however it is been used in conversations among the geeks, players and enthusiasts in the tech ecosystem especially on technology focused blogs and social media. There's still [[controversy]] surrounding the name, arguments and comments made on [http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/ article] a popular Nigerian technology blog [http://www.techcabal.com Techcabal] confirms this as few are disgruntled and think a better nickname can be created. They feel the name ought to be something else without the ‘con’ and the ‘valley’ arguing why Nigeria must mimic the west in almost everything. But there are many who actually like the name. Weekly in conversations, this name pops up and there are those who are of the [[opinion]] that if the name is disliked so much, it should not be brought up regularly.&lt;ref name="Lagos Angel Network makes first investment]"&gt;[http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/] from techcabal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2015, a tech blog's community post declared [https://radar.techcabal.com/t/yabacon-valley-is-dead-long-live-yaba-right/3376/34 Yabacon Valley is dead. Long live Yaba Right']. The conversation was about how the name Yabacon Valley was not a good branding of the tech cluster, and why other suggestions like 'Yaba Right' or 'Yaba District' or even 'Silicon Yaba' were more suitable names.  The Executive Director of [https://pinigeria.org/ Paradigm Initiative Nigeria (PIN)] a social enterprise, Gbenga Sesan in a comment said that 'If something wasn't broken, why fix it'? That the whole thing was but a fruitless argument. He was of the opinion that when the time was right, the right name would come, that 'instead of looking for a new name by all means, let all cities focus on real work without assumptions'. It must be noted that one person alone does not have the power to name a country, let alone a district. It comes from careful or careless deliberations, negotiation, discuss, or in the case of YV; incessant community debates and arguments over its origin, originality and suitability. 
  
Yabacon is a [[portmanteau]] of ‘Yaba’ the Lagos suburb and ‘Silicon’, a chemical element used to create most semiconductors commercially for [[electronic computer]]s. Although there are technology companies in this area, there are no companies involved in the making of semiconductors since the cluster is still at its green stage and [[Nigeria]] is yet to advance to the [[technology]] level of manufacturing electronics. Thus, the name is just a sheer but unconscious imitation of America's [[Silicon valley]]. The name Yabacon Valley (YV) is alive although proclaimed dead because the Yaba technology community made it a continuous topic of discussion on blogs, social media and community posts. The name was an ordinary creation of a creative writer while penning the title of an article. The tech community made it the monster it is today.

==Demographics==
The population of Yabacon Valley is between 200 and 300 thousand approximately. It is assumed that females outnumber males in the majority of the localities in Yabacon Valley due to concentration of tertiary institutions in the area.

==Boundaries==
North of this area is Shiro Street down to other side of Morocco road towards the roundabout. This also includes Abule- Ijesha South - Muritala Muhammed way from Jibowu to Wright street junction. To the East is the Lagos lagoon, Onike, Onitiri, Makoko, Iwaya, University of Lagos communities also overlooking lagoon. To the West; a descent of 3rd mainland bridge to Wright Street to Murtala Muhammed way to include Total services station at that junction.

==History==
Yaba is a part of Lagos Nigeria with many small towns and communities such as Onyigbo, Ebute metta, Makoko, Sabo, Akoka, Abule Ijesha, Onike, Jibowu, and Iwaya among others.

Yaba Local council development area as it is today has its secretariat at 198, Herbert Macaulay Street, carved out of the old Lagos Mainland local government which was created in 1977 as a separate Local government following the national reform of Local government in September 1976. Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city council which administered the Lagos Metropolitan city; this consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it.
Yaba Local council Development area as one of the Thirty Seven (37) newly created Local council Development areas was created out of Lagos Mainland by the administration of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu after the state assembly passed a law creating new local council Development areas.
The present Yaba local council area wears an urban setting; some part however mirrored rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yaba Local council development area is the commercial nerve centre for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

"Perhaps the strongest push responsible for this industrial powerhouse and cluster is the increase in demand of products leveraging technology for growth".

=== Presence of leading institutions of higher learning ===
Yabacon valley has two of Nigeria’s leading educational institutions in [[Yaba College of Technology]] (Yabatech) and [[University of Lagos]]. Both higher institutions are known to be of higher learning standards and have some of the country’s best brains as lecturers. There of course are the less seasoned institutions which are prestigious in their own right – the federal technical college Akoka (a teacher training institute) and Queens’ college one of Africa’s best post primary educational institutions.
Historical significance, landmarks and memorials. Yaba also has notable landmarks like the statue of Herbert Macaulay the father of nationalism in Nigeria. Many other landmarks such as Tejuosho Market, E-center, National library of Nigeria, Yabatech among other notable landmarks there are also historically significant landmarks, such as the tallest building on the mainland Corner stone house, the first filling station in Nigeria - (Total at Sabo) and many more.

=== An expanding middle class ===
Yaba has one of the fastest expanding middle class groups in Nigeria as a whole. This is why developers fall over themselves to renovate old buildings or expand them out rightly to create apartments for working class folks. Real estate boom is in no small way an issue to consider when middle-class families demand for accommodation.

===Reduced crime rate===
Crime rate in most parts of yaba is low. Perhaps the heavy presence of security details around the place deters criminals or could be that the ever busy nature of the place seems to inconvenience criminals. Also there is the possibility that many so called criminals may consider productive work readily available for idle hands to be more rewarding whatever the case crime rate is relatively low.

===Nearness to the island===
Lagos island is the nerve center of commerce and the service based industry in Nigeria as a whole. Living in Yaba keeps you close to the Victoria island, Ikoyi and Lekki and thereby reduces your transportation expenses, stress due to heavy traffic jams which has found common place in these aforementioned areas.

===Rapid economic expansion===
The local economy in this part of Lagos is rapidly expanding. Eateries, banks, hotels, retail stores, insurance companies, night clubs are booming implying a lot of opportunities both for investors and employment seekers. The expansion of this area is rapid and many companies are setting up so as to not miss out of its financial benefits.

===The birth and thrive of a startup cluster===
In 2011, Wennovation Hub in partnership with [[Africa Leadership Forum|African Leadership Forum]] started incubating startups in the tech ecosystem but not much noise was made till 2012 when [[Bosun Tijani]] a social innovator &amp; entrepreneur and a group of individuals set out to help animate a community of change agents who believe in building a strong base for Nigeria through technology. They were certain they could help accelerate a movement of people who are driven by the need to disrupt the status quo in Nigeria through smart application of technology. The name was later changed to [[Co-Creation Hub|Cc-HUB]], and it became Nigeria’s first startup incubator. With investment and support in cash and kind from organisations such as the Indigo Trust, Omidyar Network, MainOne Cable Company and the Lagos State government, it soon gained momentum and proceeded to install a fibre-optic-powered information superhighway. In 2011, former banker Seun Onigbinde co-founded BudgIT, a fiscal transparency project, on the third floor of CC Hub’s six-storey building in Yaba. As one of the first early-stage startups to benefit from CC Hub’s incubation drive in 2011, it received $5,000 of its $90,000 seed funding from billionaire businessman Tony Elumelu. Big names like Konga, eCommerce company valued at approximately $200 million as after raising $20 million in Series C rounds, arrived in 2013, while Africa Internet Group which has $469 million in 4 Rounds from six investors transferred six of its companies to Yaba in 2014. In same 2014 BudgIT received $400,000 grant from Omidyar. Mid 2016, Andela – a Nigerian-founded talent accelerator for programmers that has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi and New York – received $24 million in investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In 2015 Hotels.ng, which claims to be the largest hotel booking site in Nigeria secured $1.2 million in funding from Omidyar Network to expand its listings across Africa.

A number of startups including Iroko – the biggest digital retailer of Nollywood worldwide with total funding of $40 million – and Paystack, an alternative e-payments company which raised $1.3 million investment in December 2016 from international investors Tencent, Comcast Ventures and more, have offices outside the cluster but still intermingle with those from Yabacon Valley.

===The coming of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder===
A day after [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the founder of Facebook, a social media company with $350 billion market valuation walked on the streets of Yaba in Lagos Nigeria, local and international media went agog as to why Yaba is [https://www.thecable.ng/videos-zuckerberg-walks-freely-on-the-streets-of-yaba/ 'Nigeria's Silicon Valley'] after all. In Zuckerberg’s first visit to Africa, his first stop was at Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) in Yaba, Lagos, ground zero for start-ups in order to listen, learn and take ideas back to California on how Facebook can better support tech development and entrepreneurship across Africa. In a Facebook post he said; "the energy here is amazing and I’m excited to learn as much as I can, I’m looking forward to meeting more people in Nigeria" after he met and interacted with kids at a summer coding camp in CCHub, developers and entrepreneurs in the startup ecosystem in Nigeria. Then he went to Andela where his wife foundation Chan Zuckerberg foundation had made an investment months back. The visit was part of a series of global town hall meetings.
