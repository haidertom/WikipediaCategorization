'''Aotearoa International Ltd v Scancarriers A/S''' [1985] 1 NZLR 513  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding contract formation.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Aotearoa International was in the business of paper recycling, and were looking to expand by exporting to India, and was discussing with Scancarriers of shipping 4 shiploads of 1,000 tons each.

As a result of these negotiations, Scancarriers sent the following telex "FLWG OUR DISCUSSION ON FRIDAY [...] WE AGREE TO A PROMOTIONAL RATE OF US$120 [...] AND THIS RATE WILL BE HELD UNTIL 29/7/82 [...]."

However, when Aotearoa delivered the first shipment of 919 tons, Scancarriers only had space to ship some of the paper, with the remaining 271 tons being shipped on a subsequent ship.

The split sailings caused cashflow problems for Aotearoa, leaving them unable to pay for the shipping costs for the second shipment resulting in Sancarriers selling the paper to recoup the shipping costs.

Aotearoa sued for breach of contract.

==Held==
The Court ruled that the telex was merely a quote, and not an offer, as Aotearoa's manager admitted during cross examination that the normal shipping practice was that a freight contract only starts when the freight is delivered to the port and accepted for loading.

A '''biological patent''' is a [[patent]] on an [[invention]] in the field of [[biology]] that by law allows the patent holder to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the protected invention for [[term of patent|a limited period of time]]. The scope and reach of biological patents vary among jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligenceand153/gene-patents-in-europe-relatively-stable-despite-uncertainty-in-the-u-s/77899385/ | title=Gene Patents in Europe Relatively Stable Despite Uncertainty in the U.S. | work=Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News | date=2011-03-23 | accessdate=2013-06-13 | author=Sharples, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may include biological technology and products, [[genetically modified organisms]] and [[genetic material]]. The applicability of patents to substances and processes wholly or partially natural in origin is a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

==Biological patents in different jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In February 2013, Judge Justice [[John Nicholas (judge)|John Nicholas]] ruled in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in favour of a [[Myriad Genetics]] patent on the [[BRCA1]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Landmark patent ruling over breast cancer gene BRCA1|date = February 15, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/landmark-patent-ruling-over-breast-cancer-gene-brca1-20130215-2egsq.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a landmark ruling, affirming the validity of patents on naturally occurring [[DNA]] sequences. However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] came to the opposite conclusion only a few months later.  The Australian ruling has been appealed to the Full Bench of the Federal Court; submissions in the case include consideration of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = BRCA1 gene patent ruling to be appealed|date = March 4, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/brca1-gene-patent-ruling-to-be-appealed-20130304-2fg1f.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Companies can't patent genes, US court rules|date = June 14, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/companies-cant-patent-genes-us-court-rules-20130614-2o836.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was decided in 2014, affirming Nicholas J's decision in favor of Myriad, confirming that isolated genetic material ([[gene]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) are valid subjects of patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timebase.com.au/news/2014/AT499-article.html |title=Full Federal Court Upholds Gene Patents: D’Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc [2014] FCAFC 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 2015 the case was pending hearing in the [[High Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/cases/case_s28-2015 |title=D'Arcy v. Myriad Genetics Inc &amp; Anor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 the Australian high court ruled that naturally occurring genes cannot be patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/gene-patents-struck-down-by-australias-high-court/ |title=Genes can’t be patented, rules Australia’s High Court |website=www.newscientist.com  |date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=27 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[European Union]] directive [[Directive 98/44/EC|98/44/EC]] (the ''Biotech Directive'') reconciled the legislation of biological patents among certain countries under the jurisdiction of the [[European Patent Organisation]].&lt;ref name=GEN/&gt; It allows for the patenting of natural biological products, including [[DNA sequencing|gene sequences]], as long as they are "isolated from [their] natural environment or produced by means of a technical process."&lt;ref name=GEN/&gt;

The [[European Patent Office]] has [[G 2/06|ruled]] that European patents cannot be granted for processes that involve the destruction of human [[embryo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj009/05_09/05_3069.pdf Decision G2/06 of 25 November 2008, WARF/Stem Cells] (OJ EPO 2009, 306). See also [http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t102221eu1.pdf Decision T 2221/10 of 4 February 2014, Culturing stem cells/TECHNION].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Under the umbrella of [[biotechnology]], applications for patents on biological inventions are examined according to general guidelines for patents. In response to requests for additional clarity, the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO) set forth specific guidelines for biology-related inventions. Over the years, the JPO has continued to amend these guidelines to clarify their application to new technologies. These amendments have broadened the scope of patents within the biotechnology industry. The [[Japanese Patent Act]] requires that patented inventions be “industrially applicable”, i.e. they must have market or commercial potential. The JPO explicitly lists “medical activities” among inventions that fall outside the scope of industrially applicable inventions, meaning that methods of surgery, therapy, and the diagnosis of human diseases cannot be patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://sugi.pat.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WIPR-2013-Annual_Page_1.pdf | format = PDF | title = iPS Cell Technology Spurs Biological Patenting in Japan | publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Review]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 2013-08-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235917/http://sugi.pat.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WIPR-2013-Annual_Page_1.pdf | archive-date = 2013-12-30 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Biological patents in the United States}}
In the United States, up until 2013 natural biological substances themselves could have been patented (apart from any associated process or usage) if they were sufficiently "isolated" from their naturally occurring states. Prominent historical examples of such patents include those on [[adrenaline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Crouch D | title = Guest Post: Myriad Misunderstanding of Parke-Davis v.

Myriad Genetics|landmark ruling]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in June 2013 declared naturally occurring DNA sequences ineligible for patents.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Association for Molecular Pathology v.

== Ethics ==
The patenting of [[genes]] is a controversial issue in terms of [[bioethics]]. Some believe it is unethical to patent genetic material because it treats life as a [[commodity]], or that it undermines the dignity of people and animals by allowing ownership of genes.&lt;ref name=two&gt;Dresser R. 1988. Ethical and Legal Issues in Patenting New Animal Life. Jurimetrics 28:399-435&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that living materials occur naturally, and therefore cannot be patented.&lt;ref name=one&gt;Marchant GE. 2007. Genomics, Ethics, and Intellectual Property. Intellectual Property Management in Health and Agricultural Innovation: A Handbook of Best Practices. Ch 1.5:29-38&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]]'s stance is that gene patents inhibit access to genetic testing for patients and hinder research on genetic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/genetics-molecular-medicine/related-policy-topics/gene-patenting.page?|title=Gene Patenting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some feel that a patent on living material is unethical, others{{who|date=November 2013}} believe that not allowing patents on biotechnological inventions would also be unethical. Supporters of this idea suggest that patents allow the public, as well as [[Policy-makers|policy makers]], to hold the owner of the patent(s) accountable. They favor biological patents because they require disclosure of information to the public.&lt;ref name=three&gt;Caulfield TA, Gold ER. 2000. Genetic Testing. Ethical Concerns, and the Role of Patent Law. Clinical Genetics 57:370-75&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements such as the [[Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) require members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) to have intellectual property protection laws in place for most biological innovation{{Why|date=October 2018}}, making it unlikely that many countries will prohibit patents on genes altogether.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Some {{who|date=November 2013}} say that patenting genes only commodifies life if a patent applies to an entire human being, arguing that{{who|date=November 2013}} patents on single body parts do not violate [[human dignity]].&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Resnik | first1 = DB | year = 2001 | title = DNA Patents and Human dignity | url = | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 152–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of controversy in genetic patenting is how gene samples are obtained. Prior consent is required to collect genetic samples, and collection of samples from people requires consent at the national and community levels as well as the individual level. Conflicts have resulted when consent is not obtained at all three levels. The question of benefit sharing also arises when obtaining genetic samples, specifically the potential responsibility of the collector to share any benefits or profits of the discoveries with the population or person from whom the sample came.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

The last major ethical issue involving gene patents is how the patents are used post-issuance. A major concern {{who|date=November 2013}} is that the use of patented materials and processes will be very expensive or even prohibited to some degree by conditions the patent owner sets.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = LB | year = 2000 | title = Genes and Patent Policy: Rethinking IP Rights | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 803–8 | doi=10.1038/nrg909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting access like this would directly impact agricultural institutes and university researchers, among others. Some {{who|date=November 2013}} fear that holders of biotechnology patents would exploit their rights in order to make larger profits, at the potential expense of farmers, healthcare patients, and other users of patented technologies.

The ethics of using patents to increase profits are also debated. A typical argument in favor of biotech patents is that they enable companies to earn money that the companies in turn invest in further research. Without these patents, some worry that companies would no longer have the resources or motives to perform competitive, viable biotech research.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

A '''capital call''' (also known as a draw down or a capital commitment) is a legal right of an [[investment firm]] or an [[insurance firm]] to demand a portion of the money promised to it by an investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 Capital Call - Glossary - Encyclopedia - Library - VC Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524022133/http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=225 |date=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 capital call - Entrepreneurs Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526002111/http://companycrafters.onlinetech.net/Entry.aspx?Id=1292 |date=May 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A capital call fund would be the money that had been committed to the fund. The capital call is the act of actually transferring the promised funds to the investment target. A capital call agreement defines capital call terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/capital-call/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when an investor buys into a [[real estate]] fund, that fund's managers may wait some time before using the investor's money to buy real estate, either because they are waiting for real estate prices to be favorable, or because they are researching new deals. When they are ready to  buy real estate, the fund managers issue a capital call, requiring investors who have [[Capital commitment|committed]] money to the fund to  transfer that money over.

The fund might also borrow funds instead of using the investor's money. This allows the fund to benefit from [[leverage (finance)|leverage]]. The financing of the real estate purchase is realized through borrowing from banks. When the fund has reached a certain level of [[rate of return|return]], capital calls are issued and the borrowing is paid off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

[[Argentina]]'s dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called "[[Dirty War]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131783-2009-09-15.html Veinticinco años del informe de la Conadep] {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or what is known in Spanish as ''La Guerra Sucia''.

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report, [[Amnesty International]] documented incidents that "appear to have been extrajudicial executions" against Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/israeli-forces-must-end-pattern-of-unlawful-killings-in-west-bank/|title=Israeli forces in Occupied Palestinian Territories must end pattern of unlawful killings|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those incidents occurred after Palestinians attempted to attack, and murder, Israelis, but even though the attackers did not pose a serious threat due to soldiers' armor, they were shot without ensuring that the threat was real and without attempt to arrest suspects before resorting to the use of lethal force.&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

Reportedly thousands of [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort]] of [[Thailand]]'s prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].

'''Frank Shepard''' (1848–1902), a salesman for a [[Chicago]] legal publisher, invented the [[Shepard's Citations|Shepard's legal citation system]].

==Invention of citation system==
In September, 1875, a small announcement in the ''Chicago Legal News'' reported that Shepard was opening his own shop:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The firm of James Cockroft and Co. of New York, formerly of this city, have opened a branch office in this city at No. 8 Honore Block, for the sale of their publications, which will be under the charge of Frank Shepard, who is well known to the bar as having been in the law book house of E.B. Myers of this city for the last four years, and formerly with Mr. Cockroft. Frank is an efficient and obliging young man, and we hope he may succeed in his undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Cockroft &amp; Co.'s Publications, CHI. LEGAL NEWS, Sept. 25, 1875, at 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year, he also designed and published the first of his many citation books, ''Illinois Citations.''  (Traditionally, the date is given as 1873, but there is evidence that he did not begin until 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Compare 2 AMERICAN LAW PUBLISHING 1860-1900, at 343-44 (Betty W. Taylor &amp; Dr. Robert J. Munro eds., 1984) (gives 1873 date based on information provided by Shepard's company) with SURRENCY, supra note 67, at 182 (citing date of 1875 for Shepard's first citator, Illinois Citations) and Cockroft &amp; Co.'s Publications, supra note 115 (stating that Shepard opened his own shop in 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;) Shepard was surely aware of George R. Wendling's citation index, since it was published by the very firm for whom he had worked as a salesman, E.B. Myers &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;85 Law Libr. J. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard envisioned and announced in his first publication that he would issue citation books for all the states.&lt;ref&gt;See ERWIN C. SURRENCY, A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LAW PUBLISHING at 183 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shepard also began printing gummed labels for each case, listing the cases that cited it. To help the lawyers quickly learn why one case had been cited by another, Shepard’s started including one-letter codes to show that the citing case had overruled, criticized, modified, or applied some other treatment to the cited case. The stickers, or “Adhesive Annotations,” became very popular. While sitting on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], future [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] wrote “I regard Shepard’s Massachusetts Annotations as the most thorough labor-saving device that has even been brought to my attention. No one owning a set of reports can afford to be without one.” The books became so popular that the name became a verb—to [[Shepardize]].

==Frank Shepard Company==

The [[Frank Shepard Company]] began producing alternatives to the sticker collections: bound books that listed, for each case, the cases that cited it and codes describing the citing case’s treatment.

==Personal life==
Shepard did not rely solely upon his annotations for income.  An 1889 journal carried an ad for "Frank Shepard, Law Book Seller and Publisher, 184 Dearborn St., Chicago." The ad announced that he sold the new American and English Encyclopedia of Law. It also indicated that he manufactured "[g]enuine gold leaf book labels, collection registers, legal file covers, reference book stands, legal blank cases, [and] steel engravings of eminent lawyers." No mention was made of his annotations. 10 CHI. L.J. (Feb. 1889) (advertisement).

[[Image:Quentin_Massys_-_Portrait_of_a_Man_-_National_Gallery_of_Scotland.jpg|200px|thumb|16th-century painting of a [[civil law notary]], by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]]. A civil law notary is roughly analogous to a common law [[solicitor]], except that, unlike solicitors, civil law notaries do not practice litigation.]]

The [[legal profession]] has its origins in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the [[Lawsuit|cause]] of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of [[Claudius]], lawyers (''iuris consulti'') could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the [[Byzantine Empire]]: [[advocate]]s acquired more status, and a separate class of [[Notary|notaries]] (''tabelliones'') appeared.

In [[Western Europe]], the legal profession went into decline during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], re-emerging during the 12th and 13th centuries in the form of experts on [[canon law]]. The profession started to be regulated and to extend its reach to civil as well as ecclesiastical law.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==
The earliest people  who could be described as "lawyers" were probably the [[orators]] of ancient [[Athens]] (see [[History of Athens]]). However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a "friend" for assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bonner, ''Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession'' (New York: Benjamin Blom, 1927), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could ''never'' present themselves as legal professionals or experts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; They had to uphold the [[legal fiction]] that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession&amp;mdash;with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance&amp;mdash;like their modern counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Crook (classicist)|John A. Crook]], ''Law and Life of Ancient Rome'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1967), 90.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ban on fees was abolished by [[Claudius|Emperor Claudius]], who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly&amp;mdash;but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000 [[sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90. Crook cites [[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see ''The Annals of Tacitus'', Book VI ([[Franklin Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Center, PA]]: The Franklin Library, 1982), 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This was apparently not much money; the [[Satires of Juvenal]] complain that there was no money in working as an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in [[rhetoric]], not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults (''iuris consulti'').&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"&gt;Crook, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby. Advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt; Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so "precise, detailed, and technical."&lt;ref name="Crook, 88"/&gt;

During the [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]], jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey'', vol. 1 ([[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman, OK]]: University of Oklahoma Press, 1964), 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Schulz, ''History of Roman Legal Science'' ([[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1946), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Fritz Schulz, "by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers."&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 508–510.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing the need for a separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, [[Leo I the Thracian|Emperor Leo]] imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius's fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]].&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"&gt;Jones, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, it was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a ''sub rosa'' [[barter (economics)|barter]] transaction.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt; The latter was cause for disbarment.&lt;ref name="Jones, 511"/&gt;

The notaries (''tabelliones'') appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"&gt;Jones, 515.&lt;/ref&gt; They were ubiquitous and most villages had one.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jurisconsults.&lt;ref name="Jones, 515"/&gt; Roman notaries were not law-trained; they were often barely literate, with an unfavorable reputation for wrapping simple transactions in mountains of legal jargon, since they were paid by the line.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[Image:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Village Lawyer - WGA3633.jpg|300px|thumb|''Village Lawyer'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], 1621 ]]

After the fall of the western Empire and the onset of the Dark Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: "[by 1140], no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term 'professional.' "&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brundage, "The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century," &lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;20 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 185&lt;/span&gt; (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1150 onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in [[canon law]] but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as priests.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The legal profession's return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231 two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishop's courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the papal legate in London in 1237.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same decade, Frederick II, the emperor of the Kingdom of Sicily, imposed a similar oath in his civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1250 the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1275 that ''all'' ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"&gt;Brundage, 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Brundage, 189"/&gt; The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of deceit, and in 1280 the mayor's court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hamilton Baker, ''An Introduction to British Legal History'', 3rd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1990), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

An '''inquest''' is a judicial inquiry in [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, particularly one held to determine the [[cause of death|cause of a person's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inquest|title=Definition of INQUEST|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conducted by a [[judge]], [[jury]], or government official, an inquest may or may not require an [[autopsy]] carried out by a [[coroner]] or [[medical examiner]]. Generally, inquests are conducted only when deaths are sudden or unexplained. An inquest may be called at the behest of a [[coroner]], [[judge]], [[prosecutor]], or, in some jurisdictions, upon a formal request from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.municode.com/HTML/16214/level2/TIT2ADPE_CH2.12CO.html#TIT2ADPE_CH2.12CO_2.12.080INUTPR|title=Municode Library|author=|date=|website=library.municode.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''[[coroner's jury]]''' may be convened to assist in this type of proceeding.  ''Inquest'' can also mean such a jury and the result of such an investigation. In general usage, ''inquest'' is also used to mean any investigation or inquiry.

An inquest uses witnesses, but suspects are not permitted to defend themselves. The [[verdict]] can be, for example, natural death, accidental death, misadventure, suicide, or murder. If the verdict is murder or culpable accident, [[Criminal law|criminal prosecution]] may follow, and suspects are able to defend themselves there.

Since juries are not used in most [[Europe]]an [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, these do not have any (jury) procedure similar to an inquest, but medical evidence and professional witnesses have been used in court in continental Europe for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/71/I0157100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905155355/http://bartleby.com/61/71/I0157100.html |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/in/inquest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907224703/http://bartleby.com/65/in/inquest.html |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

Larger inquests can be held into [[disaster]]s, or in some [[jurisdiction]]s (not [[Inquest (England and Wales)|England and Wales]]) into cases of [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[Anon.] (2001) "Inquest", ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Deluxe CDROM edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''inquest''', as a means of settling a matter of fact, developed in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carolingian Empire]] before the end of the tenth century.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Baker, J. H. | title=An Introduction to English Legal History | edition=4th | pages=''pp''72–73 | location=London | publisher=Butterworths | isbn=0-406-93053-8 | year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the method of gathering the survey data for the [[Domesday Book]] in [[England]] after the [[Norman conquest]].&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt;  In his account of the culture of the Gauls (Commentarii de bello Gallico VI.19.3), Julius Caesar mentions a very early use of the procedure: "if a matter comes into suspicion about a death, they hold an inquiry (a ''quaestio'') concerning the wives in the method used for slaves, and if guilt is established, they kill the wives, who have been tortured, with fire and all torments."

==Inquests by region==

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Inquest (England and Wales)}}

'''In England and Wales''', all inquests were once conducted with a jury. They acted somewhat like a [[grand jury]], determining whether a person should be committed to trial in connection to a death. Such a jury was made up of up to twenty-three men, and required the votes of twelve to render a decision. Similar to a grand jury, a coroner's jury merely accused, it did not [[convict]].

Since 1927, coroner's juries have rarely been used in England. Under the Coroners Act 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1988/ukpga_19880013_en_1.html#pb3-l1g8 |title = Coroners Act 1988, s 8(3) | publisher = [[BAILII]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a jury is only required to be convened in cases where the death occurred in prison, police custody, or in circumstances which may affect public health or safety. The coroner can actually choose to convene a jury in any investigation, but in practice this is rare. The qualifications to sit on a coroner's jury are the same as those to sit on a jury in [[Crown Court]], the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], and the [[county court]]s.&lt;ref name="kcl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/coroners/jury.html|title=King's College of London - Coroner's Law Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a coroner's jury only determines cause of death, its ruling does not commit a person to trial. While grand juries, which did have the power to indict, were abolished in the United Kingdom by 1948 (after being effectively stopped in 1933), coroner's juries retained those powers until the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. This change came about after [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] was charged in 1975 by a coroner's jury in the death of Sandra Rivett, his children's nanny.&lt;ref name="kcl" /&gt;

The charity [[Inquest (charity)|INQUEST]] looks at inquest's concerning contentious deaths including those in places of detention, and has campaigned for reforms to the inquest and coroner's system in England and Wales.

There are no inquests or Coroners '''in [[Scotland]],''' where sudden unnatural deaths are reported to, and investigated on behalf of, the [[Procurator Fiscal]] for an area. The Procurator Fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexpected and unexplained deaths and any death occurring in circumstances that give rise to serious public concern. Where a death is reported, the Procurator Fiscal will investigate the circumstances of the death, attempt to find out the cause of the death and consider whether criminal proceedings or a [[Fatal Accident Inquiry]] is appropriate. In the majority of cases reported to the Procurator Fiscal, early enquiries rule out suspicious circumstances and establish that the death was due to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2006/04/12094440/4|title=What to do after a death in Scotland: ... practical advice for times of bereavement - 8th Edition|first=St Andrew's House|last=Scottish Government|date=27 April 2006|website=gov.scot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaths are usually brought to the attention of the Procurator Fiscal through reports from the police, the Registrar, GPs or hospital doctors. However, anyone who has concerns about the circumstances of a death can report it to the Procurator Fiscal. There are certain categories of deaths that must be enquired into, but the Procurator Fiscal may enquire into any death brought to his notice.

===United States===
In the United States, inquests are generally conducted by coroners, who are generally officials of a [[County (United States)|county]] or [[city]].&lt;ref&gt;18 [[C.J.S.]] ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' §§ 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; These inquests are not themselves trials, but investigations. Depending on the state, they may be characterized as [[Legal case|judicial]], [[Quasi-judicial proceedings|quasi-judicial]], or non-judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests, and the necessity for holding them, are matters of statutory law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes may also regulate the requirement for summoning and swearing a coroner's jury.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests themselves generally are public proceedings, though the accused may not be entitled to attend.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Coroners may compel witnesses to attend and give testimony at inquires, and may punish a witness for refusing to testify according to statute.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Coroners are generally not bound by the jury's conclusion, and have broad discretion, which in many jurisdictions cannot be appealed. The effect of a coroner's verdict at [[common law]] was equivalent to a finding by a [[grand jury]], whereas some statutes provide that a verdict makes the accused liable for arrest.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the county or city is responsible for the fees of conducting an inquest, but some statutes have provided for the recovery of such costs.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the evidence presented at an inquest can be used in subsequent [[Lawsuit|civil actions]] depends on the jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S. ''Coroners and Medical Examiners'' § 24.&lt;/ref&gt; though at common law, the inquest verdict was admissible to show cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;18 C.J.S.

A '''law library''' is a [[special library]] used by [[Legal education|law students]], [[lawyer]]s, [[judge]]s and their [[law clerk]]s, historians and other scholars of [[legal history]] in order to [[Legal research|research the law]]. Law libraries are also used by people who draft or advocate for new laws, e.g. [[legislator]]s and others who work in [[State governments of the United States|state government,]] [[local government]], and [[Parliamentary Counsel Office (disambiguation)|legislative counsel]] offices or the U.S. [[Office of the Law Revision Counsel|Office of Law Revision Counsel]] and [[lobbying]] professionals. Self-represented litigants also known as [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se]] litigants (parties to a civil [[lawsuit]] or criminal [[defendant]]s who do not have a licensed [[Lawyer|attorney]] representing them) will also use law libraries.

A law library may contain print, [[Computer-assisted legal research|computer assisted legal research,]] and [[microform]] collections of laws in force, [[session laws]], [[Repeal|superseded laws]], [[Country|foreign]] and [[international law]], and other research resources, e.g. [[continuing legal education]] resources and legal encyclopedias (e.g. [[Corpus Juris Secundum]] among others),  [[legal treatise]]s, and [[legal history]]. A law library may also have [[Special library|law librarians]] who help legal researchers navigate law library collections and who teach [[legal research]]. Some law libraries serve scholars from around the world, e.g. [[Institute of Advanced Legal Studies]] in London and the [[New York City Bar Association]] Law Library.

Law libraries in the [[United States]] are usually classified as a type of [[special library]] because of their focus on providing specialized resources, as well as their specialized and limited user base.

Most [[law school]]s around the world have a law library, or in some [[University|universities]], at least a section of the [[Academic library|university library]] devoted to law. In the United States, law school libraries may be subject to accreditation review by the [https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/standards.html American Bar Association Standards of Legal Education].

Law libraries may be found in courts, legislatures (e.g. the [[Law Library of Congress]]), [[Prison library|prison libraries]], government departments, private [[law firm]]s, and [[Chambers (law)|barristers chambers]].

==England and Commonwealth countries==
Outside of the United States, the largest and most extensive law libraries are those found in countries that follow the English [[common law]] which spread throughout the world with the expansion of the [[British Empire]]. These countries include but are not limited to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], and [[New Zealand]]. Law libraries in these countries can be found in law schools, courts, government, private law firms, and barristers chambers.

The largest law library in the [[United Kingdom]] is the [[Bodleian Law Library]] with a collection of over 550,000 volumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Outside of England, the largest law library in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]'s at [[York University]] in Canada, with more than 500,000 print volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/resources-and-services/library/about/history/ |title=History - Osgoode Hall Law School |publisher=Osgoode.yorku.ca |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest common law law libraries were founded in the late 15th century in London and include [[Gray's Inn]] and [[Lincoln's Inn]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Special collections of legal literature in university and research libraries in England include the Viner collection at the [[Bodleian Library]], University of Oxford (the personal library of [[Charles Viner]], bequeathed to the Radcliffe Library in 1756); a collection of English legal manuscripts at [[Cambridge University Library]]; the [[Jan Smuts|Smuts]] collection on Commonwealth law, the [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]] collection on legal history, and the Clark, Roby and Buckland collections relating to [[Roman law]], all in the Squire Law Library, a department of the Cambridge University Library; and the Slade-Baker collection of correspondence accumulated by the Slade-Baker firm of solicitors in Bewdley which is in [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Oliver (1996) ''A Guide to the Research Collections of Member Libraries''. Leeds: CURL, 1996; p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

=== Generally ===
The largest law libraries in the world are found in the [[United States]]. The world's largest law library is the [[Law Library of Congress]], which holds over 2.9 million volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Law Library of Congress, [https://blogs.loc.gov/law/files/2016/12/FY2016-LAW-ANNUAL-REPORT.pdf 'Annual Report Fiscal Year 2016'], retrieved 23 February 2017, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest academic law library is the library of [[Harvard Law School]], which holds over 2 million volumes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} By way of contrast, the largest law library in the [[United Kingdom]] is the [[Bodleian Law Library]] with a collection of over 550,000 volumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/law/about|title=Bodleian Law Library {{!}} About Us|website=www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there are three categories of law libraries in the United States. Every law school accredited by the American Bar Association houses a law library. Public law libraries are available in many states, often in the local [[courthouse]]s. Some larger [[law firm]]s maintain a private library for their own attorneys, but many firms in [[college town]]s and larger cities with [[University|universities]] simply dispatch their attorneys to local law schools to do legal research.

A typical law library holds a large number of works not seen in other libraries, including a full set of ''[[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|United States Reports]]'', one or both of the unofficial [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Law report|reporters]], the West [[National Reporter System]], the [[West American Digest System]], official reporters from various states, the ''[[Federal Register]]'', volumes of ''[[American Jurisprudence]]'', bound volumes containing issues of prominent [[law review]]s from around the country, federal and state [[statute]]s and [[regulation]]s (such as the [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), and a variety of [[Legal treatise|treatises]], encyclopedias, [[looseleaf service]]s, and practice guides.

Large law libraries may contain many additional materials covering topics such as: [[legal education]], [[research]], and [[writing]]; the history of the American legal system and profession; the history behind certain high-profile cases; techniques of oral argument; and the legislative history of important federal and state statutes.

Smaller law libraries usually hold, at a minimum, one unofficial Supreme Court reporter, selected West national reporters and digests specific to the state in which the library is located, the United States Code, a few state-specific reporters and statutory compilations (if they exist for a particular state), and several state-specific treatises and practice guides. Most academic law library websites also contain legal research guidelines on numerous legal topics that are available to the public.

In recent years, the advent of online legal research outlets such as [[FindLaw]], [[Westlaw]], [[LexisNexis]], [[Bloomberg Law]], and [[HeinOnline]] (or in Canada, [[CanLII]]) has reduced the need for some types of printed volumes like reporters and statutory compilations. A number of law libraries have therefore reduced the availability of printed works that can easily be found on the Internet, and have increased their own Internet availability. On the other hand, some university law libraries retain extensive historical collections going back to the earliest English reports. Many law libraries also participate in the [[Federal Depository Library Program]] which provides access to government information and documents to the public at no cost.  This is particularly true of law school libraries as the library at any accredited law school is automatically eligible to become a depository library under the Program.&lt;ref name="FDLP Legal Requirements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance/legal-requirements |title=Legal Requirements |publisher=Fdlp.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law libraries are members of the [[American Association of Law Libraries]] (AALL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/ |title=AALL |publisher=Aallnet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, the association has over 5,000 member libraries. Another important association for law libraries is the [[Special Libraries Association]].

===Academic law libraries===
[[File:Cincinnati Law Library Rufus King Fund bookplate (1903) by Edwin Davis French.jpg|thumb|Bookplate of the Rufus King Fund, University of Cincinnati Law Library]]
Every accredited American law school is required by the [[American Bar Association]] to have a law library meeting certain minimum specifications with respect to quantity and quality of materials available.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/misc/legal_education/Standards/2014_2015_aba_standards_chapter6.authcheckdam.pdf|format=PDF|title= American Bar Association 2014-2015 Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools; Chapter 6: Library and Information Resources |date=2014|publisher=Americanbar.org|accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some law school libraries are kept in the same building as the general library, but many are either in the law school's building, or in a separate facility altogether.

As of 2015, the American Bar Association has propounded rules requiring each law school's law library to include among its holdings the following "core collection":&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;
# all reported federal court decisions and reported decisions of the highest appellate court of each state;
# all federal codes and session laws, and at least one current annotated code for each state;
# all current published treaties and international agreements of the United States;
# all current published regulations (codified and uncodified) of the federal government and the codified regulations of the state in which the law school is located;
# those federal and state administrative decisions appropriate to the programs of the law school;
# U.S. Congressional materials appropriate to the programs of the law school;
# significant secondary works necessary to support the programs of the law school, and
# those tools, such as citators and periodical indexes, necessary to identify primary and secondary legal information and update primary legal information.

The ABA also requires a library's collection to meet the academic needs of the students and research and teaching needs of the faculty.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

The ABA further sets forth additional requirements, including the requirement that the law library have a full-time director who holds a law degree and a degree in library or information science or equivalent with extensive experience in librarianship.  The ABA also requires that the library have sufficient staff and facilities to attend to the needs of the institution.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

Many academic law librarians participate in the AALL and specifically the Academic Law Libraries special interest section.&lt;ref name="ALL-SIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/sections/all|title= Academic Law Libraries |date=2015|publisher=AALL|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public law libraries===
Public law libraries in the United States exist in many states and in federal jurisdictions, such as [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]]; many [[courthouse]]s also have a law library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Law Librarianship: Objectives, Challenges, and Solutions|last=Selwyn|first=Laurie|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2013|isbn=9781466621848|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public law libraries are publicly funded but may or may not be open to the public.

U.S. federal agencies have libraries and librarians who serve the legal research and other research needs of their employees and contractors, but these libraries are not open to the general public without an appointment. The Law Librarians' Society of Washington D.C. has a Special Interest Section, Federal Law Librarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.llsdc.org/federal-law-librarians|title=Federal Law Librarians|last=Law Librarians' Society of Washington D.C.|first=|date=|website=http://www.llsdc.org/federal-law-librarians|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131232637/http://www.llsdc.org/federal-law-librarians|archive-date=2018-01-31|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state and federal agencies maintain law libraries focusing on their regulatory areas. One prominent example is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], which runs a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Libraries|National Library Network]] providing access to specialized material to agency researchers and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/libraries/|title=EPA National Library Network, United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=2015|publisher=EPA|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court Building]] houses one of the most extensive federal public law libraries in the world, rivaled by the [[Law Library of Congress]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Strictly speaking, neither the U.S. Supreme Court Library nor the [[Law Library of Congress]] is a public access law library; both, however, are government libraries funded by taxpayers, and accountable to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] or to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] respectively. The [[Law Library of Congress]] does serve the public through various means, e.g. websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/|title=Law Library of Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; social media services, and a physically accessible library.

[[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]] are examples of states that have statutes requiring all their counties to maintain a public law library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/bpc/6300-6307.html |title=California Business and Professions Code - BPC § 6300 &amp;#124; FindLaw |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Judiciary Law §§ 813-815.&lt;/ref&gt;  While New York public access law libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycourts.gov/lawlibraries/publicaccess.shtml|title=New York Public Access Law Libraries|last=|first=|date=|website=https://www.nycourts.gov/lawlibraries/publicaccess.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131233431/https://www.nycourts.gov/lawlibraries/publicaccess.shtml|archive-date=2018-01-31|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have remained relatively small, the LA Law Library &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lalawlibrary.org/|title=LA County Law Library|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.lalawlibrary.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131233751/http://www.lalawlibrary.org/|archive-date=2018-01-31|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] is currently second in size behind the Law Library of Congress among U.S. public law libraries, with a collection at just under 1 million volumes, not including digital resources. Public law libraries are available, and in some cases are required, to offer law library and legal research services to the legal community consisting of legislators and other public officials, judges, and lawyers and to the general public, students, and to self-represented litigants. These public law libraries may be affiliated state or local courts. Some academic law libraries provide public access as well, especially in [[Public university|public universities]].

Many public law librarians are members of the [[American Association of Law Libraries]] professional association, and specifically in the Government Law Libraries special interest section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/sections/sccll/|title=Government Law Libraries|date=2015|publisher=AALL|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public law librarians who have written books about providing legal research services to the public and managing public law libraries include Anthony Aycock,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Accidental Law Librarian|last=Aycock|first=Anthony|publisher=Information Today, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-1-57387-477-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy Balleste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Law Librarianship in the Twenty-First Century|last=Balleste|first=Roy|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-0810892552|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Fishman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Navigating Legal Research &amp; Technology: "Quick Reference Guide to the 1,500 Most Common Questions about Traditional and Online Legal Research.|last=Fishman|first=Joel|publisher=Bridge Publishing Group LLC|year=2013|isbn=978-1935220329|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul D.

===Private law libraries===
Some law firms and corporate legal departments maintain in-house libraries, the size and content of which vary depending on the practice area and needs of the organization. These libraries would rarely, if ever, be available to individuals outside the organization, although in some locales law firm librarians have informal lending agreements between firms. Private law libraries often participate in the AALL's Private Law Librarians &amp; Information Professionals Special Interest Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aallnet.org/sections/pllip/|title=Private Law Librarians &amp; Information Professionals Special Interest Section|date=2015|publisher=AALL|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of law ==

=== Legislation adopted by the States of Jersey ===
Jersey's legislature, the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]] makes [[legislation]] affecting most areas of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide for Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law, chapter 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laws ====
[[File:1771 onwards Jersey Recueil des Lois.jpg|thumb|''Recueil de Lois de Jersey'' from 1771]]
The highest form of legislation made by the States is 'Laws'. If a proposed Law is likely to be controversial, the general desirability of having new legislation on the topic may be debated before the Law drafted. The procedure for making Laws is set out in the Standing Orders of the States of Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/lawsinforce/consolidated/16/16.800.15_StandingOrdersoftheStatesofJersey_RevisedEdition_1January2011.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the States of Jersey|date=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Marsh-Smith|title=The Production of Legislation in the Crown Dependencies|year=2010|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221553/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Law is in draft from, it starts the legislative process as a ''projet de loi'', which may be introduced to the States by a [[Cabinet of Jersey|Minister]], any States Member, a [[scrutiny panel]] or the Comité des [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétables]]. At the stage known as 'first reading', the title of the projet is read out and the projet is 'lodged [[Greffier|au Greffe]]' providing a two to six week breathing space for Members to read the draft Law. Under Article 16 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110631/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister or other person lodging the projet au Greffe must make a written statement that the provisions of the projet are compatible with [[ECHR|Convention rights]] or 'make a statement that although [he or she] is unable to make a statement of compatibility, [he or she] nevertheless wants the States to proceed with the projet'. At the next 'second reading' stage, there is a formal debate in the States chamber during which members consider the principle of the projet and then scrutinise the draft in detail. At 'third reading' stage there is an opportunity for minor drafting errors to be corrected. Finally, members vote to adopt the law.

The Law is then submitted via the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]]'s office for transmission to London, where [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|officials]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] examine the Law. In 2010, the [[House of Commons Justice Committee]] was highly critical of the UK Government's approach, finding that 'The Islands are more than adequately advised by their own Law Officers and Parliamentary Counsel. It seems a strange use of Ministry of Justice resources ... to engage in a kind of legislative oversight which does not restrict itself to the constitutional grounds for scrutiny'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons Justice Committee|title=Crown Dependencies, 8th Report of 2009-10, HC 56-1, para 62|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5607.htm#a6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may take several months. In an unusual move in 2011, campaigners against a Law that sought to reduce the number of Senators in the States petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Senators plea reaches Privy Council|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 June 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/06/07/save-senators-plea-reaches-privy-council/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once official scrutiny is complete in London, the Law is formally presented to Her Majesty for [[Royal Assent]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], usually held at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.

After a Law receives Royal Assent, the final step is for it be registered with the [[Royal Court of Jersey]]. At this point it is 'passed'. The Law is then brought into force at a date decided by the relevant Jersey minister. There may be a considerable delay between a Law being passed and it becoming legally effective if, for example, civil servants need to be trained, computer systems put in place or money found to pay for the new scheme.

Laws adopted and passed are published in print as ''Recueil de Lois'' de Jersey and online by the [[Jersey Legal Information Board]] on the Jersey Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|title=Laws in Force|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234724/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|archivedate=2012-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

==== Other types of legislation ====
In Jersey, there are other types of legislation in addition to Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = 8 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regulations''': these are used where a Law delegates to the States Assembly power to make legally binding rules to implement a named Law.
* '''Triennial Regulations''': since the 18th century, the States of Jersey has had power to make provisional regulations of up to three years' duration.
* '''Orders and Rules''': these are generally made by a Minister, within the scope of powers set out in a Law.

=== Customary law ===
Custom is a source of law in the Jersey legal system. It has been described as "the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community".&lt;ref&gt;Snell v Beadle [2001] UKPC 5 at [16] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/5.html&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[English common law]] where rules stated by a judge of a senior court are binding law ''because'' they are stated by a judge. In customary law, the role of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] is to look for evidence of what is "generally accepted usage and practice".

Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent (through repeated acknowledgment by the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] and in the way people conduct their affairs) that everyone accepts them as binding without discussion. The boundaries of the [[Parishes of Jersey|Parishes]], the existence of the office of [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)#Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]] and various rules relating to possession of land and inheritance fall into this category. Many rules of customary law are to be found discussed in the texts of the "Commentators" and the case law of the Jersey courts.  Where the works of the commentators do not deal with situation, the Jersey courts look at factual evidence to work out is the "generally accepted usage and practice".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Moran v Deputy Registrar for the Parish of St Helier'' [2007] JRC 151 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007/07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055727/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007%2F07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary law of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] is particularly influential as a source of law in Jersey, even though Jersey ceased to part of Normandy in 1204. Norman law developed in two main epochs–the "Ancienne coutume" (1199–1538) and the "Coutume reformée" (1538–1804).

==== Ancienne coutume of Normandy ====
The northern and western regions of Medieval Europe "were a patchwork of territorial areas in which the main source of law was customs, usages and practices which had become relatively fixed and settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = Chapter 2 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in [[Feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

When in 1309 [[Edward II of England]] sent Justices to Jersey, the people of Jersey were "asked by what law they claimed to be governed, the law of England, of Normandy, or by some special customs of their own? They answered 'By the law of Normandy, and referred the Justices to the ''Summa of Malcael'' [the Jersey name for the Grand Coutumier], where the Norman laws are well embodied'... But they added, and this a clause that caused much trouble later, 'except that we have certain customs used in this island from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 16th century, two commentaries on the Grand Coutumier, written in Normandy, have been influential in Jersey law. [[:fr:Guillaume Le Rouillé|Guillaume Rouillé of Alençon]] (also known as Le Rouillé) was the author of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-xCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ALe%20intitle%3AGrant%20intitle%3ACoustumier&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Le Grant Coustumier du pays &amp; duché de Normendie : tres utile &amp; profitable a tous practiciens]'' (1534; 1539). He also produced commentary on the neighbouring province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] (pictured).

Guillaume Terrien's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xYaA_5KCB04C&amp;dq=Commentaires%20du%20droit%20civil%20tant%20public%20que%20priv%C3%A9%20observ%C3%A9%20au%20pays%20et%20Duch%C3%A9%20de%20Normandie&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentaires du droit civil, tant public que privé, observé au pays et Duché de Normandie]'' was first published in 1574. Dawes explains: "Terrien’s own work comprised the selecting of texts from the ''Grand Coutumier'', putting them into an order which suited his scheme (even to the point of cutting and pasting quite disparate texts) and then commenting on the resulting amalgam. To this commentary a further author added notes headed 'Additio', more often than not in Latin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dawes| first =Gordon| authorlink =| title =A note on Guillaume Terrien and his work| journal =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review| volume =| issue =| pages =| publisher =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd| location =| year =2007| language =| url =http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| jstor =| issn =| doi =| id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate =27 August 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055355/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two modern versions of the text of the Grand Coutumier have been produced. The first was by [[Jurat]] William Laurence de Gruchy entitled ''L’Ancienne Coutume de Normandie: Réimpression, éditée avec de légères annotations'' (1881), based on Le Rouillé’s 1539 edition, using a double-column format setting out the Latin and French texts side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Coutume Reformée of Normandy ====
[[File:Berault_Coutume_Reformée_3rd_edn_1620.jpg|thumb|Berault's 1620 commentary]]
The second period in the development of Norman custom was between 1583 and 1804 and is known as the ''Coutume reformée'' (the reformed custom). In 1453, [[Charles VII of France]] issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be "redacted", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was the last part of France to comply with this order but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by [[Henry III of France]].

There are two reasons why the Coutume reformée might be thought to have little relevance to [[Jersey]]: it was created 380 years after Jersey had ceased formally to be part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and it was a text sanctioned by the king of France. Nonetheless, Jersey lawyers and courts made frequent references to the Coutume reformée and by virtue of its assimilation into Jersey law over the centuries it is regarded as a source of the island's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Within France, customary law was abolished in 1804 with the introduction of uniform [[Napoleonic code|codes]] of civil and criminal law across the whole of France.

==== Jersey commentators on custom ====
As well as relying on commentaries produced in France, Jersey has an indigenous legal literature on custom. In the 17th century, [[Jean Poingdestre]] (1609–1691) and [[Philippe Le Geyt]] (1635–1716) wrote several works. Some chapters of [[Charles Sydney Le Gros|C.S. Le Gros]]' 20th century work, ''Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey'' also remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.S.|last=Le Gros|title=Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd|year=1943|ISBN=978-0-9557611-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislative reforms of custom ====
Many rules of customary law have been amended or abolished by legislation in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of this include:
* “Any rule of customary law, that a contract passed before the Royal Court for the transfer of immovable property may be annulled, at the instance of the heirs or devisees, as the case may be, of the transferor, if he or she dies within 40 days of the passing of the contract, is abolished” (Customary Law Amendment (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 1984).
* In customary law, the age of majority was 20 years; the Age of Majority (Jersey) Law 1999 reduces this to 18 years.
* “The rule under customary law that all gifts to a concubine are null is hereby abolished” (Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993).
* Customary law did not permit a cause of action for/against a person to survive the person’s death against/for the benefit of the person’s estate; Customary Law Amendment (Jersey) Law 1948 reversed this situation.
* The ''année de jouissance'' (the right of an executor to have the income arising during the administration of a moveable estate for a year and a day) was abolished by the Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993.

=== Influence of English and French law ===
Some fields of Jersey, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by [[English common law#Common law|English common law]]. In other branches of law, notably contract, Jersey courts may have regard to [[French civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Law Commission |title=Consultation Paper No. 5: The Jersey Law of Contract |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/Contract.htm }}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide on Jersey Contract Law |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; based closely on the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], requires Jersey courts so far as possible to interpret legislation so that it is compatible with rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Jersey public bodies are required to act in conformity with Convention rights.

In January 2012, Jersey introduced laws to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16536572 | work=BBC News | title=Jersey recognises civil partnerships | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, the main working language of the Jersey legal system changed from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Hanson|title=The Language of Law: the importance of French|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221249/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1930s, almost all legislation passed by the States Assembly was in French.

[[File:Tables des Décisions de La Cour Royale de Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Tables de Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey'' 1885-1978]] The Jersey legal system does not follow the strict rules of [[binding precedent]] that exist in common law jurisdictions such as [[English law|England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qatar v Al Thani'' 1999 Jersey Law Reports 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]] is not bound by its own previous decisions on a point of law but it will generally follow them unless persuaded that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. A similar approach is taken by the [[Courts of Jersey#Appeal courts|Court of Appeal]]. All Jersey courts are, however, bound by points of law decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in previous Jersey appeals to that court.

During the 19th and 20th centuries a series of improvements to the system of writing and reporting judgments was put in place. In 1885, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] began to publish the ''Tables des Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey''–a subject index to decided cases, prepared by the [[Greffier]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Law, Jersey, ''Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law'' (2011), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Charles Thomas Le Quesne]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] returned to Jersey from practice at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] and was appointed [[Lieutenant Bailiff of Jersey|Lieutenant Bailiff]]. Up to this point, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]]'s judgments were in the French style of ''jugements motivés'',{{French spelling}} written in French by the [[Greffier]] rather than the judge, and expressing the reasons for the court's decision only very briefly. Le Quesne changed the language of judgments to English and adopted the [[common law]] style of judgments, where the judge gives detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting the rival submissions made at trial by [[counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Weston'' 1979 Jersey Judgments 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, the Royal Court published its and the Court of Appeal judgments in a series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Judgments'' (eleven volumes in total). From 1984, judgments have been published a new series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Law Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports International Ltd {{cite web |url=http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123022208/http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Jersey Legal Information Board (JLIB) was set up to promote "accessibility of the written law and legal processes to the public and of an integrated and efficient legal system, through the use of information technology and by other means".&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Legal Information Board (Incorporation) Law 2004 {{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f16%2f16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181215/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F16%2F16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgments of the Royal Court and Court of Appeal are published online on [https://web.archive.org/web/20120929022406/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Search/default.aspx?target=uj www.jerseylaw.je], with open access to "unreported" judgments as part of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

== Judiciary ==
The head of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary in Jersey]] is the [[Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]], who as well as performing the judicial functions of a [[chief justice]] is also the President ([[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]]) of the [[legislature|States of Jersey]] and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]].

=== Judicial appointments processes ===
The posts of Bailiff and [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]] are Crown appointments, formally made by Her Majesty the Queen, on [[Politics of Jersey#The Crown|advice]] of the UK government's [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

[[File:Juges Jour d'la Libéthâtion 2009 a.jpg|thumb|The Bailiff and Jurats outside the Royal Court in 2009]]An appointment process has developed in recent years, without a legislative basis, for vacancies for the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]], Attorney General for Jersey and Solicitor General for Jersey. This involves advertising for candidates and the preparation of a shortlist by a selection panel consisting of the Bailiff (in the chair), the senior [[Jurat]] and the chairman of the [[Jersey Appointments Commission]]. A process of consultation is then carried out, including the Jurats, the [[States Consultative Panel]] (which includes the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]]), a number of elected members of the States, senior lawyers (the [[Bâtonnier]], the President of the Law Society, the former President of the [[Law Society of Jersey]] and the President of the [[Chambre des Ecrivains]]), the other Crown Officers and the local [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. All candidates on the shortlist are then interviewed by the selection panel. A single name is then sent by the Lieutenant Governor to the Secretary of State for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=5–15|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process has not been used for appointment to the office of Bailiff on the basis that "The Secretary of State has accepted that the position of Deputy Bailiff is a training ground for the position of Bailiff, and that, therefore, all things being equal, you would expect to move up, assuming of course that you have performed to everyone's satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|page=14|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurat]]s are elected by an [[electoral college]] consisting of the Bailiff, the Jurats, the [[Constable#Channel Islands|Connétables]], the elected members of the states, advocates and solicitors of the Royal Court.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLaw"&gt;Article 4 of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting is by secret ballot.

Commissioners of the Royal Court are appointed by the Bailiff for the hearing of a specified cause or matter or a specified term.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"&gt;Part II of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff appoints the [[Courts of Jersey#Magistrate's Court|Magistrate]] and the Assistant Magistrate (who hold full-time salaried posts) and part-time Relief Magistrates (legal practitioners who carry out duties on a daily fee-paid basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now normal for the Bailiff to convene a panel to advise on salaried appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=17–18|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and members of the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] 'hold office during good behaviour'.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the Court of Appeal: {{cite web|title=Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221706/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas senior judges in England and Wales who are appointed by Crown may only be removed from office with the consent of both Houses of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Courts Act (previously known as the Supreme Court Act) 1981, section 11(3)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/11|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jud-acc-ind/judges-and-parliament|title=Judges and parliament|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Justice]] may dismiss a Jersey judge appointed by the Crown without the agreement [[States of Jersey]]. This happened in 1992, when the then Deputy Bailiff [[Vernon Tomes]] was dismissed from office by the [[Home Secretary]] (the UK minister who at the time was responsible for the [[Crown Dependencies]]) on grounds of his delays in producing written judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons|title=Debates vol 208 cc93-4W|date=19 May 1992|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1992/may/19/jersey-bailiff-dismissal#S6CV0208P0_19920519_CWA_184}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyer|title='Dismissal of "slow" Judge angers Jersey|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey to review constitutional links with UK|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurats hold office up to the age of 72 years. A Jurat who 'in the opinion of the Court, is permanently unable, through physical or mental incapacity, or for any other reason, efficiently to carry out the duties of the office, may be called upon by the Court to resign'. A Jurat who refuses to resign may be removed from office by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the petition of the Superior Number (the Bailiff and five or more Jurats) of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 of the Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff may if he 'thinks fit, terminate the appointment of a Commissioner on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour'.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"/&gt;

The Magistrates, who are also appointed by the Bailiff not the Crown, may not be removed from office 'except by virtue of an Order of Her Majesty in Council'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(3) of the {{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the Chief Minister informed the [[States of Jersey]] that the Magistrate-Designate, Ian Christmas, has 'agreed not to sit as a judge following a discussion with the former Bailiff as a result of a criminal investigation into an alleged [[fraud]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2009/3%20Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20CM%20re%20suspension%20of%20Magistrate%20designate.pdf|title=Extract from States of Jersey Hansard|year=2009|publisher=States of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=States of Jersey|title=Official Report ('Hansard')|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111039/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Further delay in fraud case|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 March 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/03/15/further-delay-in-fraud-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Christmas was subsequently convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2f12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|title=Attorney General v Lewis, Christmas, Foot and Cameron (2012) JRC 177|publisher=JerseyLaw|date=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110638/http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2F12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the Bailiff's Office has asked the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]] to arrange for a UK judge to undertake a disciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/07/27/what-next-for-fraud-judge/|title=What next for fraud judge?|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/09/25/christmas/|title=New inquiry to decide whether Christmas retains his position|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Jersey Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonymusings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/ian-christmas-legal-background.html|title=Ian Christmas: the Legal Background|publisher=Tony's musings|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial independence in Jersey===

====Code of Conduct====
All judges in Jersey are bound by a [http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx code of conduct] promulgated by the [[Jersey Judicial Association]] in 2007. This requires judges to 'uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and perform their duties with competence, diligence and dedication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of conduct for members of the judiciary of Jersey, paragraph 1|year=2007|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ECHR Article 6====
All courts in Jersey are required under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] to be 'independent and impartial'.&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; In 2000, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held in ''McGonnell v United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/62.html|title=McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) ECHR 62|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a breach of Article 6 in ''Guernsey'' where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as President of the [[States of Guernsey]] when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the [[Royal Court of Guernsey]] in a case where that legislation was relevant. The Court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff 'was subjectively biased', stated that the 'mere fact' that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff's impartiality. A Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff in Jersey is able to avoid a ''McGonnell'' situation simply by not sitting in the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] in cases concerned with legislation that was debated when he presided in the [[States of Jersey|States]]. The current Bailiff, Mr [[Michael Birt (Bailiff of Jersey)|Michael Birt]] has conceded that 'we probably need to improve our systems to be very compliant with ''McGonnell'' and that one probably ought to keep a running list of those statutes where I have presided so at least I could invite the parties to consider whether they wanted to object or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 46-47, Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers, Public Hearing 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent review chaired by [[Lord Carswell]], set up by the [[States of Jersey]], a legal opinion was commissioned from [[Rabinder Singh (Barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] QC in which he expressed the view that 'there is no reason in law why the present constitutional arrangements in respect of the Bailiff should be altered. However, the trend suggests that the tide of history is in favour of reform and that the legal position will be different in 10 years time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/Pages/StatesReports.aspx?ReportID=491|title=Report into Review of Crown Officers|publisher=Jersey Government|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of Lord Carswell's inquiry concluded that Mr Singh's opinion 'provides an additional reason why the Bailiff should cease to be the President of the States'.&lt;ref&gt;Para 5.16 of Report into Review of Crown Officers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey]] have not accepted this aspect of the Carswell report. Many prominent islanders do not believe that any change is necessary or desirable.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite web|first=Reg|last=Jeune|title=Let's not throw out 800 years of history and good governance|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=20 December 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/12/20/lets-not-throw-out-800-years-of-history-and-good-governance/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/HowGovernmentWorks/ReviewCrownOfficers/Pages/WrittenSubmissions.aspx|title=Written submissions on role of Crown Officers|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stuart Syvret litigation====
In recent years, a former [[States of Jersey|State's]] member Mr [[Stuart Syvret]] has argued in legal proceedings in England and Jersey that all members of [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|the Jersey judiciary]] lack the appearance of independence and impartiality. In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7946988.stm |title=Jersey abuse case review rejected |first= |last=Anon|work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=400612 |title=Syvret loses High Court bid |first= |last=Anon |work=channelonline.tv |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his [[blog]], who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursing a grievance in Jersey|newspaper=Private Eye (no 1288)|date=13 May 2011|page=30}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jersey senator jailed over data-breach blog|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2010|page=11}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemming shields man|newspaper=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=26 October 2009|page=8}} (referring to Liberal Democrat MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]]'s assistance to Syvret)&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hough|title=Jersey senator to claim asylum at Commons|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 October 2009|page=16}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge against senator in abuse cover-up claim|newspaper=The Times|date=20 July 2009|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and there is a lack of appearance of independence and impartiality because judges are appointed by the [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff.

== Jersey legal profession ==
[[File:Institute of Law, St Helier, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Institute of Law, Seale Street, St Helier|upright]]The Jersey legal profession has three types of Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and [[Public notary#United Kingdom|Notaries Public]].&lt;ref name="1997Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|title=Advocates and Solicitors Law 1997|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221753/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/90|title=Public Notaries Act 1843}} (United Kingdom), section 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advocate#Advocates in the Channel Islands|Advocates]] have rights of audience to represent clients in all courts. Jersey solicitors have no general rights of audience. Notaries have no rights of audience. The Law Society of Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/ Law Society of Jersey ]&lt;/ref&gt; is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the [[Dean of the Arches]], referred to as the [[Master of the Faculties]], who is normally an English [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk|title=Faculty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law firms focus on legal practice relating to Jersey's [[Economy of Jersey#Financial .26 legal services|finance industry]], the largest being: [[Appleby Spurling Hunter|Appleby]]; Bedell Cristin; [[Carey Olsen]]; [[Mourant Ozannes]]; and [[Ogier (law firm)|Ogier]], all of which are regarded as part of the "[[offshore magic circle]]". Smaller firms and sole practitioners also provide a wide range of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613012913/http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-13|title=Law Firms|publisher=Law Society of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several law firms now have offices in both Jersey and [[Guernsey]] but the legal professions of the two islands are separate, as they are separate from those in England, Wales and Scotland. Most notaries in Jersey are employed by, or are partners in, local firms of Jersey Advocates or Solicitors, although some are in English solicitors firms or practising purely as notaries, independent of the general legal profession. There is a local Jersey Notaries Society.

The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The Attorney General and his deputy, the Solicitor General, are non-voting members of the States Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/LawOfficers/Pages/index.aspx|title=Law Officers|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of qualifying as a Jersey lawyer is regulated by the Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997&lt;ref name="1997Law"/&gt; and is similar for both advocates and solicitors. Since 2009, candidates for the [[Jersey law]] examinations are required to enrol on the Jersey Law Course run by the Institute of Law, Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ Institute of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to take five compulsory papers: (i) Jersey legal system and constitutional Law; (ii) Law of contract and the law relating to security on moveable property and bankruptcy; (iii) testate and intestate succession; law of immoveable property and conveyancing; and civil and criminal procedure. In addition, candidates must take one of three option papers: (i) company law; (ii) trusts law; or (iii) family law.

The admission of lawyers as Notaries in Jersey is governed by an order of the [[Master of the Faculties]]. It is necessary to show that a prospective Notary has been in actual practise in Jersey as a Jersey-qualified Advocate or Solicitor for a period of 5 years and is required to pass an examination in Notarial Practice. The Master does however retain a discretion to admit those who are not so qualified "...in appropriate circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/TheNotaries%28JerseyandGuernsey%29AdmissionOrder2012.pdf|title=The Notaries (Jersey and Guernsey) Admission Order 2012|publisher=Faculty Office|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal aid ==
There is no publicly funded [[legal aid]] system in Jersey, though the [[States of Jersey]] may exercise discretion to pay defence legal fees in serious criminal trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A system in need of overhaul|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2010/09/15/a-system-in-need-of-overhaul/}}.&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Elaine|last=Byrne|title=£3m cost may lead to legal aid review|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=21 October 2009|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2009/10/21/3m-cost-may-lead-to-legal-aid-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in cases involving children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dolores|last=Cowburn|title=Serious case review cost the Island over £600,000|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/15/serious-case-review-cost-the-island-over-600000/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bailiff champions welfare of children|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=1 July 2008|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2008/07/01/the-bailiff-champions-welfare-of-children/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their first 15 years of practice, Jersey Advocates and Solicitors, but not Notaries, are required to participate in a scheme organised by the profession to ensure so far as possible that people without sufficient resources are not prevented from pursuing or defending civil and criminal cases in the island's courts. The scheme is administered on behalf by the [[Bâtonnier]] (a senior member of the profession). Cases accepted by the Bâtonnier as eligible are allocated to lawyers on the basis of the 'Tour de Rôle' (i.e. according to one's turn). Depending on the litigants' income and assets, lawyers may work [[pro bono]] or charge a reasonable fee in accordance with published guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Citizen's Advice Bureau|title=Legal Aid|url=http://www.cab.org.je/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer assigned a legal aid case may choose to pay another lawyer to handle the case and several firms have established specialist legal aid departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Harry|last=McRandle|title=Law firm stops taking legal aid divorce cases|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=5 November 2005|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2005/11/05/law-firm-stops-taking-legal-aid-divorce-cases/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous and long-standing calls for reform of the present system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Quérée|title=Public should pay for legal aid, says Bailiff|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=14 September 2007|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2007/09/14/public-should-pay-for-legal-aid-says-bailiff/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Sibcy|title=Taxpayers "may have to foot bill for legal aid"|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=12 September 2003|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2003/09/12/taxpayers-may-have-to-foot-bill-for-legal-aid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law reform ==
The Jersey Law Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/ Jersey Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[States of Jersey]] in 1996 to keep Jersey [[Law commission|law under review]] and bring forward proposals for law reform.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}

The '''''Laws''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Νόμοι, ''Nómoi''; [[Latin]]: ''De Legibus''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Estienne]] (ed.), ''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'', Vol. 2, 1578, [https://archive.org/stream/platonisoperaqua02plat#page/702/mode/2up p. 703].&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[Plato]]'s last and longest [[dialogue]].  The conversation depicted in the work's twelve books begins with the question of who is given the credit for establishing a civilization's [[law]]s. Its musings on the ethics of government and law have established it as a classic of [[political philosophy]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} alongside Plato's more widely read ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

Scholars generally agree that Plato wrote this dialogue as an older man, having failed in his effort in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] on the island of [[Sicily]] to guide a tyrant's rule, instead having been thrown in prison. These events are alluded to in the ''[[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Letter]]''.  The text is noteworthy as Plato's only undisputed dialogue not to feature [[Socrates]].

==Summary==

===Setting===
Unlike most of Plato's dialogues, Socrates does not appear in the ''Laws'': the dialogue takes place on the island of [[Crete]], and Socrates appears outside of Athens in Plato's writings only twice, in the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', where he is just outside the city's walls, and in the ''Republic'', where he goes down to the seaport [[Piraeus]] five miles outside of Athens. The conversation is instead led by an [[Athens|Athenian]] Stranger (in Greek, ξένος ''xenos'') and two other old men, the ordinary [[Sparta]]n citizen Megillos and the Cretan politician and lawgiver Clinias from [[Knossos]].

The Athenian Stranger, who resembles Socrates but whose name is never mentioned, joins the other two on their religious pilgrimage from Knossos to the cave of [[Zeus]]. The entire dialogue takes place during this journey, which mimics the action of [[Minos]]: said by the Cretans to have made their ancient laws, Minos walked this path every nine years in order to receive instruction from Zeus on lawgiving. It is also said to be the longest day of the year, allowing for the densely packed twelve chapters.

By the end of the third book Clinias announces that he has in fact been given the responsibility of creating the laws for a new Cretan colony, and that he would like the Stranger's assistance. The rest of the dialogue proceeds with the three old men, walking towards the cave and making laws for this new city which is called the city of the Magnetes (or Magnesia).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0166:book=8:section=848d&amp;highlight=magnetes Plato, ''Laws''. Book VIII, 848D]. "And if there exist any local deities of the Magnetes or any shrines of ancient gods whose memory is still preserved, we shall pay to them the same worship as did the men of old. ...". A footnote in the [[Loeb Classical Library]] 1926 edition, translated by [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]], says: "The original inhabitants of the site of Clinias's new colony (cp. 702 B, 860 E); they subsequently migrated to Magnesia in Asia Minor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Virginia, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2137376&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0017383508000521 "Plato's Prisons"], in ''Greece &amp; Rome'' journal, v.55, n.2, October 2008, pp.193-201&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics===
The question asked at the beginning is not "What is law?" as one would expect. That is the question of the apocryphal Platonic dialogue ''[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]]''. The dialogue rather proceeds from the question of who it is that receives credit for creating laws.

The questions of the ''Laws'' are quite numerous, including:
*Divine revelation, divine law and law-giving
*The role of intelligence in law-giving
*The relations of philosophy, religion, and politics
*The role of music, exercise and dance in education
*Natural law and natural right

The dialogue uses primarily the Athenian and Spartan (Lacedaemonian) law systems as background for pinpointing a choice of laws, which the speakers imagine as a more or less coherent set for the new city they are talking about.

==Comparisons==

===Comparisons to Plato's other dialogues===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
The ''Laws'' is similar to and yet in opposition to the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. It is similar in that both dialogues concern the making of a city in speech. The city of the ''Laws'' is described as "second best", not because the city of the ''Republic'' is the best, but because it is the city of gods and their children. The city of the ''Laws'' differs in its allowance of private property and private families, and in the very existence of written laws, from the city of the ''Republic,'' with its property-system and community of wives for the guardians, and absence of written law. Also, whereas the ''Republic'' is a dialogue between Socrates and several young men, the ''Laws'' is a discussion among old men, where children are not allowed and there is always a pretense of piety and ritualism.

Traditionally, the ''Minos'' is thought to be the preface, and the ''[[Epinomis]]'' the epilogue, to the ''Laws'', but these are generally considered by scholars to be spurious.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Cooper in Plato, ''Complete Works''.  Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Comparisons to other works on Greek law===
Plato was not the only [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] author writing about the law systems of his day, and making comparisons between the [[Athens|Athenian]] and the [[Sparta]]n laws.  Notably, the ''Constitution of the Spartans'' by [[Xenophon]], the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', wrongly attributed to Xenophon, and the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', possibly by [[Aristotle]] or one of his students, have also survived.

Some centuries later [[Plutarch]] would also devote attention to the topic of Ancient Greek law systems, e.g. in his ''Life of Lycurgus''. [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]] was the legendary law-giver of the Lacedaemonians. Plutarch compares Lycurgus and his Spartan laws to the law system [[Numa Pompilius]] introduced in [[Rome]] around 700 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives|Plutarch's Lives]]''.  Nabu Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both pseudo-Xenophon and Plutarch are stark admirers of the Spartan system, showing less reserve than Plato in expressing that admiration.

[[File:Complexity-legal-translation.jpg|thumb|Complexity of legal translation]]
'''Legal translation''' is the [[translation]] of texts within the field of [[law]]. As law is a culture-dependent subject field, legal translation is not necessarily [[Transparency (linguistic)|linguistically transparent]]. Intransparency in translation can be avoided somewhat by use of Latin legal terminology, where possible. 

Intransparency can lead to expensive misunderstandings in terms of a [[contract]], for example, resulting in avoidable [[lawsuit]]s. Legal translation is thus usually done by specialized law translators. Conflicts over the legal impact of a translation can be avoided by indicating that the text is "authentic" i.e. legally operative on its own terms or instead is merely a "convenience translation", which itself is not legally operative. Courts only apply authentic texts and do not rely on "convenience" translations in adjudicating rights and duties of litigants.

Most legal writing is exact and technical, seeking to precisely define legally binding rights and duties. Thus, precise correspondence of these rights and duties in the [[source text]] and in the translation is essential. As well as understanding and precisely translating the legal rights and duties established in the translated text, legal translators must also bear in mind the legal system of the [[source text]] (ST) and the legal system of the [[target text]] (TT) which may differ greatly from each other: Anglo-American common law, Islamic law, or customary tribal law for examples.

Apart from terminological [[lexical gap|lacuna]]e (lexical gaps), textual conventions in the source language are often culture-dependent and may not correspond to conventions in the target culture (see e.g. Nielsen 2010). Linguistic structures that are often found in the source language may have no direct equivalent structures in the target language. The translator therefore has to be guided by certain standards of linguistic, social and cultural equivalence between the language used in the [[source text]] (ST) to produce a text (TT) in the target language. Those standards correspond to a variety of different principles defined as different approaches to translation in [[translation theory]]. Each of the standards sets a certain priority among the elements of ST to be preserved in TT.  For example, following the functional approach, translators try to find target language structures with the same functions as those in the source language thus value the functionality of a text fragment in ST more than, say, the meanings of specific words in ST and the order in which they appear there.

Different approaches to translation should not be confused with different approaches to [[translation theory]]. The former are the standards used by translators in their trade while the latter are just different [[paradigms]] used in developing translation theory.

Few jurists are familiar with terms of translation theory. They may ask [[interpreters]] and [[translators]] to provide [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] translation. They often view this term as a clear standard of quality that they desire in TT. However, verbatim translation usually is undesireable due to different grammar structures as well as different legal terms or rules in different legal systems.  Jurists asking for "verbatim" translation are likely making the lay misconception that an accurate translation is achieved by substituting "the correct" words of the target language one-for-one from the ST. In reality, they just want to have a [[faithful and fluent translation]] of ST, having no doubt that a good translator will provide it. They do not realize that word-by-word translations could sound as complete nonsense in the target language, and usually have no idea of different professional translation standards. Many translators would probably choose to adhere to the standard that they themselves find more appropriate in a given situation based on their experience rather than to attempt to educate the court personnel.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Legal translators often consult specialized bilingual or polyglot [[law dictionary|law dictionaries]]. Care should be taken, as some bilingual law dictionaries are of poor quality and their use may lead to mistranslation.

A '''looseleaf service''' is a type of publication used in [[legal research]] which brings together both [[Primary authority|primary]] and [[Secondary authority|secondary]] source materials on a specific field or topic in [[law]].  For this reason they are sometimes called "subject-matter services".

Looseleaf services are most commonly used for research in areas of law which change rapidly due to [[Regulation|regulatory]] and [[Administrative law|administrative]] developments (such as [[tax law]], [[environmental law]], [[financial regulation]], and [[labor law]]).  Looseleaf services are typically contained in [[ring binder]]s to keep them updated, because they are published fairly frequently (at minimum monthly, sometimes weekly or bi-weekly) in order to keep the information therein current.  Most [[Law library|law libraries]] have a subscription to several of these services, and many of the more popular services are available electronically as well.

==Types==
===Interfiled===
In an interfiled looseleaf service, individual pages can be removed and replaced with more recent printings, eliminating the need for pocket parts or similar supplements.  Most of the looseleaf services offered by [[Commerce Clearing House]] are of the interfiled type.

===Newsletter-style===
Newsletter-type looseleaf services are published as topical [[newsletter]]s, which are then filed by law librarians under the appropriate topic headings for future reference.

One of the best-known looseleaf services, ''[[United States Law Week]]'', is of this type.  Most of the looseleaf services published by [[Bureau of National Affairs]] are newsletter-style.

==History==

Looseleaf service was invented by Richard Prentice Ettinger in 1914, founder of Prentice Hall. As a 19-year-old assistant to his [[Princeton University]] tax professor, he published the professor's book at his own risk. The first print run sold well and he ordered a second print run from an outside printing company. On the day that this second print run arrived, the [[United States Congress]] changed the tax law enough that the book was outdated. Faced with this challenge, Ettinger came up with the idea of cutting the pages (leaves) loose, replacing the few pages where changes in the tax code had occurred, drilling holes through the pages and putting them into a ring-binder. Even though it was more costly, it did have the benefit that future changes could easily be accommodated by simply exchanging a single leaf or group of pages.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

'''Neurolaw''' is an emerging field of interdisciplinary study that explores the effects of discoveries in neuroscience on legal rules and standards. Drawing from [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[social psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], neurolaw practitioners seek to address not only the descriptive and predictive issues of how neuroscience is and will be used in the legal system, but also the normative issues of how neuroscience should and should not be used.

The most prominent questions that have emerged from this exploration are as follows: To what extent can a tumor or brain injury alleviate criminal punishment? Can sentencing or rehabilitation regulations be influenced by neuroscience? Who is permitted access to images of a person's brain? Neuroscience is beginning to address these questions in its effort to understand human behavior, and will potentially shape future aspects of legal processes.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=July–August 2011|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520|title=The Brain on Trial|journal=The Atlantic}} [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petoft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Neurolaw: a brief introduction|publisher=''Iranian Journal of Neurology''|date=2015|url=http://ijnl.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijnl/article/download/570/232|pmc=4395810|pmid=25874060|volume=14|journal=Iran J Neurol|pages=53–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New insights into the psychology and cognition of the brain have been made available by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). These new technologies were a break from the conventional and primitive views of the brain that have been prevalent in the legal system for centuries. Brain imaging has provided a much deeper insight into thought processes, and will have an effect on the [[law]] because it contests customary beliefs about mental development. Because the science is still developing and because there is substantial opportunity for misuse, the legal realm recognizes the need to proceed cautiously. Neurolaw proponents are quickly finding means to apply neuroscience to a variety of different contexts. For example, intellectual property could be better evaluated through neuroscience. Major areas of current research include applications in the courtroom, how neuroscience can and should be used legally, and how the law is created and applied.&lt;ref name="Petoft-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Toward Human Behavior Sciences from the Perspective of Neurolaw|publisher=''International Journal of Public Mental Health and Neurosciences''|date=2015|url=http://sarvasumana.in/files/26.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodenough"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=Oliver R. and Macaela Tucker|date=December 2010| url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|title=Law and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science|publisher=Annual Review|volume=6|pages=61–92|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|last2=Tucker|first2=Micaela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neuroscience and the law have interacted over a long history, but interest spiked in the late 1990s. After the term neurolaw was first coined by Sherrod J. Taylor in 1991,&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"/&gt; scholars from both fields began to network through presentations and dialogs. This led to an increasing pull to publish books, articles, and other literature. The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Dana Foundation were the first groups to provide funding for the new interdisciplinary field. Parallel to the expansion of neurolaw, an emergence of ethics specifically regarding neuroscience was developing as well. The intersection of neurolaw and ethics was able to be better scrutinized by the initiation of the Law and Neuroscience Project in 2007.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; The MacArthur Foundation launched Phase I of its project through a $10 million grant in hope of integrating the two fields. The initiative sustained forty projects addressing a multitude of issues, including experimental and theoretical data that will provide further evidence as to how neuroscience may eventually shape the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130024912/http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-30|title=History: Phase I|publisher=The Law &amp; Neuroscience Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of study has also piqued the interests of several universities. Baylor College of Medicine's Initiative on Neuroscience and the Law’s research seeks to research, educate, and make policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neulaw.org/goals|title=Goals of the Initiative|publisher=Baylor College of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514220120/http://www.neulaw.org/goals|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Neuroscience and Society began in July 2009, and is working towards confronting the social, legal, and ethical inferences of neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuroethics.upenn.edu/|title=Center for Neuroscience and Society|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurocriminology==

The term neurolaw was first used in practice by the neuroscientist and attorney J. Sherrod Taylor in 1991.&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J. Sherrod |author2=J. Anderson Harp |author3=Tyron Elliott|date=Oct 1991|title=Neuropsychologists and Neurolawyers|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=293–305|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.5.4.293}}  See also: {{cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Steven K.|year=2010|ssrn=1472245|title=Blaming the Brain|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp; Technology|publisher=University of Missouri School of Law Legal Studies|volume=11|issue=2009–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's book, ''Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injury'' (1997), was used as a resource for attorneys to properly introduce medical jargon into the courtroom and to further develop the implications of neuroscience on litigation. In addition, Taylor explained the consequences of ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''.&lt;ref name="Juliano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juliano|first=Elizabeth|author2=James R. Fell |date=April 1998|url=http://www.medicineforthedefense.com/MAIN/articles/newspubs-a-07.aspx|title=Book Review: Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries|journal=The MIM Reporter|publisher= Litigation Management, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This United States Supreme Court case resulted in what is now known as [[Daubert Standard]], which sets rules regarding the use of scientific evidence in the courtroom.

===Crime prediction===

[[Psychological testing|Behavioral testing]] and [[neuroimaging]] evidence offer a potentially accurate method of predicting human behavior. This advancement would be beneficial particularly for determining guilty criminal sentences or discerning which criminals deserve to be released on parole or detained in jail due to the  possibility of future offenses. Not only could it aid in the process of [[recidivism]], it could also show an indication of the need for personal rehabilitation. In light of this information and its potential applications, the legal system seeks to create a balance between just punishment and penalties based on the ability to predict additional criminal activity.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"/&gt;

===Insanity defense===

The tendency of the United States criminal justice system has been to limit the degree to which one can claim innocence based on [[mental illness]]. During the middle of the 20th century, many courts through the [[Durham rule|Durham Rules]] and the American Law Institute Model Penal Code, among others, had regarded impaired volition as legitimate grounds for the [[insanity defense]]. However, when [[John Hinckley]] was acquitted due to insanity, a reversal of opinion occurred, which then spurred a narrowing definition of mental illness. Decisions became increasingly based on the [[M’Naghten Rules]], which asserted that unless one was able to prove that a mental illness kept him or her from knowing that the act was wrong, or knowing the disposition of the criminal act, one would not be able to be tried as mentally handicapped. Contemporary research conducted on the prefrontal cortex has criticized this standpoint because it considers impaired volition as a factor. Many courts are now considering "irresistible impulse" as legitimate grounds for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Sapolsky|date=2004-11-26|url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055055/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-14|title=The frontal cortex and the criminal justice system|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B|publisher=The Royal Society|volume=359|pages=1787–1796|doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1547|issue=1451|pmid=15590619|pmc=1693445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the factors neuroscience has added to the insanity defense is the claim that the brain “made someone do it.” In these cases, the argument is based on an understanding that decisions are made before the person is able to consciously realize what is happening. More research on control and inhibition mechanisms will allow further modifications to the insanity defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; Impaired functioning of the [[prefrontal cortex|PFC]] is evidence proving that a prime factor in mental illness is an issue of volition. Many experiments using MRI show that one of the functions of the PFC is to bias a person towards taking the more difficult action. This action is representative of a long-term reward, and it is competing with an action that will lead to immediate satisfaction. It is responsible for moral reasoning, including regret. Individual variations that impair the PFC are extremely detrimental to the decision-making process, and give an individual a greater likelihood in a committing a crime he or she would have otherwise not committed.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"/&gt;

===Brain death===

Injuries or illnesses that lead to a [[persistent vegetative state]] have come to the forefront of many ethical, legal, and scientific issues regarding brain death.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=March–April 2008|url=http://www.thehoustonlawyer.com/aa_mar08/page36.htm|title=Neuroscience and the Law|journal=The Houston Lawyer|publisher=Houston Bar Association|volume=16|issue=6|pages=36–40}} [http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman_NeuroscienceandLaw_HoustonLawyer.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a difficult subject to know when someone is beyond hope for recovery, as well as to decide who has the right to make the decision of when death is most appropriate. Research to determine a person’s cognitive state has helped develop an understanding of the vegetative state. While a person can be awake and conscious, he or she may not show any signs of awareness or recognition to external stimulation. In 2005, research was conducted on a 23-year-old female who suffered severe head trauma due to an automobile accident. The woman was diagnosed to be in a vegetative state; after five months she continued to be unresponsive, but did show normal sleep and wake cycles.  Using fMRI technology, researchers concluded that she was able to understand external stimuli, showing a response via activity in specific regions of the brain. For example, there was increased activity in the middle and superior temporal gyri similar to activity exhibited by control subjects. This positive response reveals potential for medical imaging to be used to understand the implications of brain death, and to help answer legal, scientific, and ethical questions pertaining to brain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Owen|date=2006-09-08|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5792/1402.full|title=Detecting Awareness in the Vegetative State|journal=Science|publisher=AAAS|volume=313|issue=5792|doi=10.1126/science.1130197|page=1402|pmid=16959998|display-authors=1|last2=Coleman|first2=MR|last3=Boly|first3=M|last4=Davis|first4=MH|last5=Laureys|first5=S|last6=Pickard|first6=JD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nootropics==

In addition to questions involving how neuroscience should influence criminal and civil law, neurolaw also encompasses ethical questions regarding [[nootropics]], more commonly known as mind-enhancing drugs. A plethora of drugs are already known to cause a variety of effects on the brain, for example, the stimulatory action of [[caffeine]]. Similarly, current research suggests that the future may hold even more powerful medications that can specifically target and alter brain function.&lt;ref name="Lanni"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanni|first=Cristina|author2=Silvia C.

Analogous to the controversy over the use of [[anabolic steroids]] in professional sports, many high schools and universities are wary of students eventually using nootropics to artificially boost academic performance.

Some of the questions raised regarding the use of nootropics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahakian|first=Barbara|author2=Sharon Morein-Zamir |date=2007-12-20|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/4501157a.html|title=Professor's little helper|journal=Nature|volume=450|pages=1157–1159|doi=10.1038/4501157a|issue=7173|pmid=18097378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How will these enhancers affect performance gaps between family income classes?
* Will it become necessary to use an enhancing drug simply to remain competitive in society?
* How does society distinguish between what is an acceptable substance (e.g. caffeine) and an unacceptable substance to alter one's mind?
* Do people have the right to experiment with substances to modify their own cognition?

Scientists and ethicists have attempted to answer these questions while analyzing the overall effect on society. It is largely accepted that mind-enhancing drugs are acceptable for use with patients facing cognitive disorders, as in a case of prescribing [[Adderall]] to children and adults with [[ADHD]]. In contrast, Adderall and [[Ritalin]] have become popular black-market drugs, most notably on college campuses. Students often use them to maintain focus when struggling to complete large amounts of schoolwork.&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|date=2009-04-27|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/04/27/090427fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=all|title=Brain Gain|journal=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Much of neurolaw depends on state-of-the-art medical technology that has been adapted to a new role in the legal system. Among the most prominent technologies and disciplines are [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[epigenetics]]. MRI and fMRI are particularly important because they allow detailed [[Brain mapping|mapping of the human brain]], potentially allowing technicians to visualize another person's thoughts. FMRI, a derivative of MRI, allows for oxygen-specific mapping to view the most active areas of a brain at a specific moment. Combined with the knowledge of how the brain works in different situations (lying, remembering, etc.), there is the potential to use functional neuroimaging evidence as a modern form of [[lie detection]]. Similarly, PET scans use a radioactive tracer injected into the body to analyze brain tissue.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"/&gt;

===Lie detection===

[[Image:Brianlies.png|thumb|500px|right|The diagram above is an overview of the varying patterns of brain activity detected by fMRI. Yellow highlighted regions are where there is the most activity occurring. TR and CR levels represent "telling the truth." LT signals indicate a subject is withholding information. LN signals indicate a subject is making up information.]]
In regard to neuroscience as a form of lie-detection, specific regions of the brain have been analyzed in order to uncover patterns of truth telling, deception, and false memory. Notably, an important obstacle to any form of lie detection is when subjects inadvertently recall [[source-monitoring error|false memories]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This is induced experimentally by presenting subjects a list of semantically related words. While they believe their responses to be true, their recollections are in fact false. For instance, reading a long list of words including "moon," "sun," and "Mars," may cause a subject to incorrectly believe the word "Earth" to have been listed, even if it was not. This is a normal psychological occurrence, but presents numerous problems to jury attempting to sort out the facts of a case. Indeed, researchers have attempted to distinguish genuine truths from "false truths." Subjects are subsequently quizzed on the word list while specific regions of the brain are analyzed for activity. For instance, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] has been shown to activate when subjects are pretending to know information which they do not know, in contrast to truth telling and false recognition. Alternatively, the [[hippocampus|right anterior hippocampus]] activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. However, there remain limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between the many forms of truths and deceptions. For instance, future research hopes to uncover patterns that differentiate whether someone has genuinely forgotten an experience in contrast to the active choice to withhold information.&lt;ref name="Abe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abe|first=Nobuhito|date=December 2008|url=http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|title=Neural Correlates of True Memory, False Memory, and Deception|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=18|pages=2817|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn037|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114004801/http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

The Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics (SCBE) specifically analyzes the contribution of fMRI to legal, ethical, and social challenges so that their conclusions may offer a liable transfer of fMRI information to policy recommendations and the clinical realm. The research will focus on identifying emerging trends of emotion, moral judgment, and other complex human behaviors. With the information that the researchers obtain, an advisory board will compile a list of guidelines to interpret the results. In analyzing the use of fMRIs, they will assess the risks and accuracy of using these machines to quantitatively detect mental illness. The [[Major Depressive Disorder]] is used as their main experimental model.&lt;ref name="Illes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics|year=2011|url=http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|title=Advancing Neuroimaging: Ethical, Legal and Social Issues|publisher=Stanford School of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002041436/http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

The use of neuroimaging in the legal system creates a very divided critical audience; many argue for its potential, while others argue it will not accurately replace human investigations to verify criminal decision making processes. Neuroimaging is inadequately understood; the multiple variables it displays, including [[medication]], [[nutrition]], and [[hormones]] create an image that is very complex and often impossible to interpret accurately. Other critics highlight that the image derived from the technology does not display the brain’s [[intentionality]] during the illegal act. Functional neuroimaging was not intended to calculate volition, and while it may offer insight into the processes that cause behavior, it is debated whether or not the images can objectively narrow in on human reason.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=Neil K.|year=2009|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/37/2/239.pdf|title=Neuroimaging, Culture, and Forensic Psychiatry|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=37|issue=2|pages=239–244|pmid=19535562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also many worries about privacy as well.

Controversy over the science behind fMRI lie detection entered a Federal courtroom in 2010 with a [[Daubert]] hearing concerning its admissibility in a criminal trial but was excluded based on the state of the supporting science. A 2012 appeal of the case failed to change the court's view of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee at Jackson|url=http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0312p-06.pdf|website=United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortcomings in the laboratory research that forms the basis of fMRI lie detection, and absence of validation in more complex contexts outside of the laboratory, leave serious open questions about the suitability of the method for legal or other high-stakes uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Benjamin|last3=Phelps|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Wagner|first4=Anthony D.|title=Functional MRI-based lie detection: scientific and societal challenges|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=20 January 2014|volume=15|pages=123–131|doi=10.1038/nrn3665|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v15/n2/full/nrn3665.html|pmc=3867253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in practice==

Neurolaw has already been applied to various situations throughout the United States and other countries. Two companies, [[No Lie MRI]] and Cephos Corp, both offer lie-detection services using fMRI. Advertising to lawyers, prosecutors, and other firms, they attempt to provide a twenty-first century version of the traditional [[polygraph]].&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Because of variations among individuals’ responses however, the technology is not fool proof and many are skeptical of its uses. Nevertheless, It is often considered to be a more advanced technique than the polygraph test. The United States rarely allows evidence to be accepted in the court of law; and in response to worries of its scientific validity, judges have so far veered away from allowing Cephos and No Lie MRI tests into the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Criminal law===
In Mumbai, India, the legal system has taken a more rapid approach in applying neuroscience, and has already incorporated it into criminal convictions. In 2008, an Indian woman was convicted of murder based on strong [[circumstantial evidence]], including a brain scan that suggested her guilt. This conviction was sharply criticized by Hank Greely, a professor of law at Stanford University. Greely contested the scan based on evidence produced by a [[Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling]] test (BEOSP).  No scientific peer-review studies had ever been published demonstrating the efficacy of BEOS, raising questions about its reliability in such an important decision.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

In the United States, convicts have used introduced brain scan results during the sentencing phase of trials. Because the court system allows nearly any mitigating evidence during sentencing, brain scans have not faced as many hurdles for this application. In two instances occurring in California and New York, defendants were able to reduce their sentence of first-degree murder to manslaughter. Each presented brain scans suggesting hindered neurological function hoping to mitigate their responsibility in the crime.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Brain images were also used in the case of Harrington v. State of Iowa in 2003 as evidence for the defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Government and military===
The United States Military has become increasingly interested in the possibilities made available by neuroscience. In an effort to combat terrorism, officials hope to use modern technologies for a variety of purposes. Brain imaging may help to distinguish between enemy combatants from those who pose no risk. Similarly, officials can help determine the mental stability of their own soldiers. Nootropic drugs could also be used to enhance the focus and memories of soldiers, allowing for better recognition of dangers and improved performance. However, this has led to questions regarding the personal privacy of soldiers and detainees. While the general population generally has the right to refuse medication, soldiers may eventually face compulsory medication to benefit the overall mission.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Additionally, questions regarding the accuracy of brain imaging arise when testing detainees for concealed information. Although the civilian court system is reluctant to use unproven technologies, the military's reliance on them may generate controversy over the possible innocence or guilt of enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Begley|first=Sharon|date=2006-12-15|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116613325554750607|title=A Pentagon Agency Is Looking at Brains -- And Raising Eyebrows|journal=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of novel technological innovations and information in the field of neuroscience, the military has begun to anticipate specific uses for such neuroscience research. However, these approaches, which can alter human cognitive abilities as well as infringe on an individual’s right to the privacy of his or her own thoughts, are still innovatory and early in development. Therefore, the precise effects and potential influence are yet to be well explained.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jonathan Y.|author2=Margaret E. Kosal |date=2008-06-20|url=http://thebulletin.org/security-impact-neurosciences|title=The security impact of the neurosciences|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present day treaties, such as the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the Chemical Weapons Conventions, address only the use of certain chemical agents and therefore cannot adequately regulate the fast-paced evolution of recent advancements in cognitive science research.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt; Due to this ambiguity and the potential of technology misuse, it has become increasingly pressing to address the regulations needed for controlling the extent to which neuroscience research can be employed in military functions.

Another area of interest to the military is the use of human enhancement drugs. [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon branch of the United States Department of Defense, is often perceived to be responsible for military research and development of technology. A current operation of DARPA is named the Preventing Sleep Deprivation Program, which conducts research on the molecular processes and changes in the brain involved with sleep deprivation, with the ultimate purpose to maximize warfighters’ cognitive abilities, even with sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Frank|date=2006-01-17|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2006/01170/At_Military_s_Behest,_Darpa_Uses_Neuroscience_To.4.aspx|title=At Military's Behest, Darpa Uses Neuroscience To Harness Brain Power|journal=Neurology Today|publisher=American Academy of Neurology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=4, 8–10|doi=10.1097/00132985-200601170-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this research, sleep deprivation prevention drugs such as Modafinil and Ampakine CX717 have increased in significance. However, because these chemical drugs directly affect natural chemical reactions and receptors in the body, the ethics of their use as well as safety are in question.&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-17|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1885825,00.html|title=Safety Concerns Raised Over Popular Wakefulness Drug|journal=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cautions and concerns==
Neuroscience is a complex field and one not well understood by the general public. Although experts recognize the possibilities and drawbacks of brain imaging relatively well, others may be either too confident in or completely reject the field. Judges must decide on the validity of various neurological evidence so it can enter the courtroom, and juries must not be too willing to place all faith in neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Petoft-3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Controversial Brain Imaging as a Terrorism Emergency Measure in Neurolaw Discourse|publisher=''Neurology &amp; Neurotherapy Journal''|date=2017|url=https://medwinpublishers.com/NNOAJ/NNOAJ16000118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Ingfei|date=2009-10-21|url=http://stanfordlawyer.law.stanford.edu/2009/10/neurolaw/|title=Neurolaw|journal=Stanford Lawyer|publisher=Stanford School of Law|issue=81|volume=44|issn=0585-0576|pages=14–21}} [http://www.law.stanford.edu/publications/stanford_lawyer/issues/81/pdfs/sls81-articles.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to glorified depictions of forensics labs on popular television shows, brain imaging has faced criticism for having a "[[CSI effect]]". Society may soon develop a false sense of what is possible with contemporary technologies, and may not understand the value of evidence being presented.&lt;ref name="Merikangas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merikangas|first=James R.|year=2008|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/36/4/499|title=Commentary: Functional MRI Lie Detection|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=36|issue=4|pages=499–501|pmid=19092067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law and psychology [[Stephen J. Morse]] described the abuse of neuroscience in courtrooms with a pseudo-disease he called "Brain Overclaim Syndrome".  He focused on claims made about people having [[diminished responsibility]] or no responsibility for their actions because those actions were caused by "the brain", in situations where the science could not support such causal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=Stephen J.|title=Brain Overclaim Syndrome and Criminal Responsibility: A Diagnostic Note|journal=Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law|date=2006|volume=3|page=397|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/osjcl/Articles/Volume3_2/Symposium/Morse-PDF-04-05-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchen|first1=L|title=Science in court: Arrested development.|journal=Nature|date=18 April 2012|volume=484|issue=7394|pages=304-6|doi=10.1038/484304a|pmid=22517146|url=https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.10456!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/484304a.pdf?origin=ppub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

* Defendants were in a "state of nature" so Newgarth's normal laws did not apply to them; the laws of nature would allow them to agree to sacrifice one's life to save the other four
* If the laws of Newgarth do apply, then a purposive approach must be taken to the statute. Judges can find an exception to the law by implication, as the Courts had earlier done with [[self-defense]].

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627–628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628–629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70–71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

'''Wayne Norviel Aspinall''' (April 3, 1896 &amp;ndash; October 9, 1983) was a [[lawyer]] and [[politician]] from [[Colorado]]. He is largely known for his tenure in the [[United States House of Representatives]], serving as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from 1949&amp;ndash;1973 from [[Colorado's 4th congressional district|Colorado's Fourth District]]. Aspinall became known for his direction of the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee]], of which he was the chairman from 1959&amp;ndash;1973. Aspinall focused the majority of his efforts on western land and water issues.

His actions supporting resource development often drew the ire of the increasingly powerful [[environmental movement|environmental]] [[lobbying|lobby]] in the 1960s. [[David Brower]], a prominent executive director of the [[Sierra Club]], said that the environmental movement had seen "dream after dream dashed on the stony continents of Wayne Aspinall."  The congressman returned the animosity, calling environmentalists "over-indulged zealots" and "[[Aristocracy|aristocrats]]" to whom "balance means nothing."  This battle shaped Aspinall's congressional career.

==Biography==
Aspinall was born in [[Middleburg, Logan County, Ohio]] in 1896 and moved to [[Palisade, Colorado]] in 1904. He studied at the [[University of Denver]] until [[World War I]], when he enlisted in the armed services (the Air Service of the Signal Corps). He returned to DU after his discharge and graduated in 1919. After several years of teaching around the state, he enrolled in [[Sturm College of Law|law school]] in Denver and graduated in 1925. In 1930, he won a seat in the [[Colorado House of Representatives|Colorado State House of Representatives]], serving as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] in 1937 and 1938 before moving to the [[Colorado Senate|State Senate]] from 1939 to 1948. He served in [[World War II]] as a captain in Military Government during 1943 and 1944 as well. In 1948, he chose to run for national office, hoping for it to be a stepping stone to [[Governor of Colorado|Colorado's governorship]]. However, he would stay in the U.S. House for 24 years.&lt;ref name="DUFindingAid"&gt;{{Citation|publication-date=2013|title=Wayne N. Aspinall Papers; 1925-1976|type=Finding Aid|publisher=University of Denver Libraries, Anderson Academic Commons, University of Denver|url=http://digital.library.du.edu/findingaids/view?docId=ead/m008.xml;query=;brand=default}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living on Colorado's Western Slope defined Aspinall's political ideology. His family had traditionally voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but the party's in-fighting in 1912 between [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[William H. Taft]] disillusioned Aspinall. However, despite becoming a Democrat, his rural roots shaped a relatively [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] philosophy. He believed in limited federal involvement in western land and water issues; to him, localities could better decide the uses of their resources. "When I was young…I lived outside the little town of Palisade, and the townspeople always seemed to call the shots. Then I moved to Palisade, and the bigger town of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] always seemed to call the shots. Then I went to the state Legislature, and the Eastern Slope…seemed to call the shots. And in Congress, the big metropolitan areas seemed to hold all the marbles."

His service in the U.S. House ended in 1972 with his loss in the Fourth District Democratic primary. However, Aspinall remained active in politics. He voiced his opinions on the need for the United States to become self-reliant for its energy needs, pushing [[oil shale]] development until his death in 1983.

Colorado history remembers Aspinall as one of the state's most influential politicians. Known as "The Chairman," he led the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee during a period that defined future water and land policy in the United States. Colorado governor [[Richard Lamm]], a Democrat who had several ideological differences with Aspinall, remarked that "[N]o one in our history has done more to win Colorado a place at the table in Washington." He had a son, [[Owen Aspinall]], who went on to become [[Governor of American Samoa]].

==Colorado River Storage Act of 1956==
Aspinall favored dams and water reclamation projects for several reasons: (1) the power they generated; (2) general recreational use; and (3) he felt the key to Western economic prosperity lay in obtaining permanent stored supply of water for economic purposes. In Aspinall's mind, Americans had many opportunities to enjoy scenic areas, so damming a few of them would not hurt the country. After his career, he boasted that he had brought over $1 billion worth of water projects to his district. According to his observers, he "never met a dam he didn't like."

The [[Colorado River Storage Project]] (CRSP) came before Congress in the early to mid-1950s. The bill, sponsored by Wayne Aspinall and several western allies, called for damming several areas in the Upper Basin of the [[Colorado River]]. It included the [[Echo Park Dam]] proposal, located within [[Dinosaur National Monument]]. This became a volatile issue between environmentalists and water project advocates. Located just below the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]] and [[Yampa River]]s, the proposed {{convert|525|ft|m|adj=on}} high dam would have created a 43,000 acre (170&amp;nbsp;km²) lake, flooding the Green River Canyon for {{convert|63|mi|km}} and the Yampa River Canyon for {{convert|44|mi|km}}. However, because of increased environmental awareness around the country, the majority of the public opposed the project. In 1954 alone, the Department of the Interior received 20,000 pieces of mail about the plan, and one insider estimated the letters ran 80 to 1 in opposition of the project.

In 1954 and 1955, environmentalists defeated the controversial aspects of the CRSP. In '55, Aspinall conceded that for the bill to pass, he needed to sacrifice the Echo Park plan. Several more compromises between the two sides gave way to the Colorado River Storage Act of 1956 (Public Law 485, in chapter 203), which called for the creation of other irrigation projects and several large dams, including the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] in Utah, which created [[Lake Powell]]. Other projects created from the CRSP included the [[Flaming Gorge Reservoir|Flaming Gorge]], [[Navajo Reservoir|Navajo]], and [[Curecanti National Recreation Area#Reservoirs and dams in Curecanti|Curecanti]] reservoirs. For his compromise, Aspinall gained five other reclamation projects and three hydroelectric dams for the Fourth District. The bill passed the House 256-136 in March 1956 and then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed it into law soon thereafter.

==Frying Pan Arkansas Project of 1962==
This plan, originally proposed in 1951, called for water diversion out of the Frying Pan and [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork]] Rivers on the Western Slope of Colorado to the [[Arkansas River]], which flowed to a drier climate in the southeast part of the state. Because the Front Range (Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo) had a tremendous population advantage over the Western Slope, most of the state favored the project. Precedent for this maneuver had been set in 1937 with the [[Colorado-Big Thompson Project]], which transferred Western Slope water to farmers in northeast Colorado.

Because he wanted to focus the House's efforts on the CRSP in the mid-'50s, Aspinall tabled Fry-Ark until 1960. However, when the issue resurfaced, Aspinall's opinion created controversy in his own district. Many of his constituents disapproved of sending their water to the Front Range. Aspinall, however, pushed the plan through because he realized that as a strong proponent of public water development, it seemed contradictory for him to block reclamation projects that benefited others. The bill passed in August 1962 when Aspinall attained a plan calling for the construction of a {{convert|28,000|acre.foot|m3}} reservoir on the Roaring Fork River near Aspen, which would compensate the Western Slope for its loss of water.

Fry-Ark demonstrated Aspinall's resolve to proliferate the amount of publicly funded water projects throughout the West, pitting him against the wishes of the majority of his constituents in the early 1960s. He quickly regained favor with them, however, when its precedent eventually brought more dams and reclamation projects back to the Fourth District.

==Wilderness Act of 1964==
One of the first comprehensive pieces of environmental legislation during the era faced a lengthy battle in Congress between Presidents [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] and western politicians like Aspinall. When the Wilderness bill first came to the House in 1961, Aspinall employed various stall tactics to never allow the popular bill out of the Interior Committee. He continued this through 1962 and into '63, earning him the wrath of the country's environmentalists, preservationist politicians, and a large amount of the public.

However, in November 1963 Aspinall made a deal with [[John Kennedy]]. Aspinall greatly desired a public land review commission (see below), while one of Kennedy's primary goals was the passage of the Wilderness Act. Aspinall agreed to release the bill in exchange for the administration's cooperation with the land commission. (Also, [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]] on November 22, 1963 created an ethos in Washington that essentially made Kennedy a [[martyr]]. [[Lyndon Johnson]] took up and pushed through many of his legislative goals because of public empathy.)

Before Aspinall let the [[Wilderness Act of 1964]] pass, he dropped the original request of 55 million acres (220,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of protected wilderness to only 9.1 million acres (37,000&amp;nbsp;km²). He also inserted a clause, called the "1984 clause," that allowed mining interests to still have access to many of these areas until December 31, 1983. Despite these concessions, the House passed it 373-1 and Lyndon Johnson signed it in September. The act also refused to turn over exclusive power to the executive branch, keeping some power in Congress for public land oversight. Ironically, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] named Aspinall their "Conservationist of the Year" in 1964 for his role in the eventual passage of the bill.

==Colorado River Basin Act of 1968 and the Central Arizona Project==
From 1966 to 1968, Aspinall took on the final significant water project battle of his congressional career. The purpose of the Colorado River Basin Project, according to supporters, was to build dams to generate revenue and energy for communities in the Lower Basin of the Colorado River without using much of the Upper Basin's river water. The primary focus of the project was the [[Central Arizona Project]] (CAP). CAP supporters, among other demands, wanted to build two dams, one that would flood Grand Canyon National Monument and part of [[Grand Canyon National Park]] (Bridge Canyon Dam), with the other on the edge of the Grand Canyon (Marble Canyon Dam). Aspinall originally supported this, claiming it would generate revenue for all Colorado River Basin states. In turn, however, he demanded that his district receive five reclamation projects for his support. Several congressmen, including Arizona senator [[Carl Hayden]], saw this as action as a move that held the state hostage, and many would come to resent Aspinall for it.

Environmentalists vehemently opposed the CAP because of its detriment to the scenery of the Grand Canyon. Aspinall would later say "We viewed the development of the river as the only reasonable, practicable, safe, and logical way for millions of Americans and visitors to enjoy the canyon bottom which to date so few have had an opportunity to visit or view."  However, during the debate, the Sierra Club mocked that philosophy, purchasing an ad in national newspapers in July 1966. "Should we also flood the [[Sistine Chapel]] so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?" it asked.

Sensing that he couldn't break the stalemate, Aspinall dropped the Grand Canyon dams from the CRPB in late August 1967. The bill eventually passed in the middle of 1968, creating the [[Colorado River Basin Act]]. However, in exchange for this compromise, Aspinall did receive five projects for Colorado (the Dallas Creek, Animas-La Plata, West Divide, San Miguel, and Dolores projects).

Of those five, only two were eventually built (Dolores and Dallas Creek). The Animas-La Plata project is currently under construction, and is one of the last major water projects in the West. [[Jimmy Carter]] declared a "Hit List" in 1977 on what he felt was wasteful spending on "[[pork barrel]]" water projects, eliminating the other three (among others). Furthermore, no new major reclamation projects were approved during the rest of the era, partly because Aspinall's heavy-handed demands that constrained the legislation broke apart the western coalition of politicians that supported the construction of water projects.

==Public Land Law Review Commission==
Kennedy's concession in 1963 to enact the Wilderness Act gave Aspinall the go-ahead to organize his pet project, the [[Public Land Law Review Commission]] (PLLRC) in 1965. The PLLRC reviewed all federal regulations affecting the control and uses of the nation's public lands and recommended changes that would help the federal government manage these areas more efficiently. Aspinall served as the commission's chair for the entirety of its existence, from 1965 until 1970.

The final report came out on June 23, 1970. Titled "One Third of the Nation's Lands," it gave 137 recommendations to [[Richard Nixon]] and Congress. Among its suggestions: 
* States should have a greater say in how public lands are managed
* Congress should have greater say in the uses of public land because the executive branch exerted too much singular influence
* All public-land issues should be concentrated under a new Department of Natural Resources, with committees in the House and Senate
* The Secretary of the Interior's power to withdraw public lands from development without Congressional approval should be limited
* Regional mining, timber, and grazing needs should be supported to increase economic growth in local communities
* The federal government should help stimulate the [[oil shale industry]]

Environmentalists blasted its findings. The Sierra Club accused the study of being "oriented toward maximum immediate commercial exploitation..." predicated upon a world with an "ever-expanding economy and unlimited resources."  Others stated that the report only considered studies and opinions favorable to Aspinall's political ideology. Many citizens were also still unhappy with Aspinall for blocking the creation of the [[Redwood National Park]] in California for half of the decade until its passage in 1968, and they saw this as more evidence that he served as a mouthpiece for the extractive industries' interests in Congress.

Aspinall proposed HR 9211 in his final session in Congress to implement many of the PLLRC's recommendations, but it failed to pass. During the height of the environmental movement, many of these suggestions were unacceptable to the public. However, later bills spawned from the ideas in the PLLRC, such as the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act|Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976]].

==1970 and 1972 Democratic primaries==
After over two decades in office, the turbulent forces of the 1960s and early '70s caught up with Aspinall. With [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] gaining strength throughout the country by protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and advocating [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s and [[femminism|equal rights for women]], reformers gained control of the Democratic Party. They jumped on the opportunity to remove one of the party's most conservative members.

In 1970 a young Democrat named [[Richard Perchlik]] challenged Aspinall in the Fourth District Democratic primary. Although Aspinall won by over 11,000 votes in his first primary challenge since 1948, Perchlik's campaign portrayed Aspinall as old (74 at the time) and out of touch with the ideals of liberals on the war and the environment. The challenger also accused "The Chairman" of being too connected to the extractive special interests and railed against him for his role in what reformers viewed as a flawed seniority system in Congress.

Aspinall's friend and colleague, Democratic congressman [[Byron Rogers]] of Colorado's First District, did not survive 1970's primary season, however. A young liberal lawyer from Denver, [[Craig Barnes]], defeated Rogers (although Barnes himself lost the general election). Rogers had a similar philosophy and legislative record to Aspinall, seemingly foreshadowing Aspinall's fate in 1972.

The degree to which Aspinall appreciated the challenge of liberal Democrats is debated. He did say that "this drive toward liberalism, organization of committees, etc., is causing me to wonder if I haven't reached the place where I should let some younger and more militant person take over."  However, he never altered his campaign message in 1972, even after the Republican-controlled Colorado General Assembly redrew the state's district lines to include largely liberal precincts in the Fourth District. "Wayne Aspinall represents all the interests because all the people have interest in our resources," his campaign said, continuing to target the miners, ranchers, and loggers that lived on the Western Slope. He never attempted to alter his message to assuage the concerns of his new liberal constituents.

His opponent in the 1972 Democratic primary, [[Alan Merson]], employed the same strategy that Perchlik and Barnes used two years previously.  Merson attacked Aspinall for being slow to recognize developing energy problems, promoting policies that fed constant growth, building needless water projects, and being a tool of special interests. Merson received extensive external aid, accepting endorsements from ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Field and Stream]]'', and even ''[[Reader's Digest]]''. The environmental lobby provided most of the support to Merson's campaign, with $20,000 coming from the [[League of Conservation Voters]]. [[Environmental Action]], having named Aspinall to their 1972 "Dirty Dozen" list of biggest congressional enemies to the environment, also endorsed Merson.

Using the young, liberal vote on the Front Range, Merson defeated Aspinall in the primary 53% to 47%. History credits Aspinall's loss to his age, the strength of the [[environmental issue]] in 1972, and the redistricting that cost "The Chairman" much of his conservative support on the Western Slope.

However, redistricting still favored Republicans, despite the liberal Merson's victory. Moving urban voters into the Fourth split the Democratic vote and consolidated Republican strength. Merson lost to [[James Paul Johnson]], who had been Aspinall's unsuccessful Republican opponent in 1966, in the general election in November 1972.

==Post-Congressional life==
Aspinall stayed relatively active after leaving office in January 1973. He crossed party lines and endorsed [[Gerald Ford]] for President in 1976. He also pressed for further exploration of oil shale in the late 1970s, serving on the board of directors for the Paraho Oil Shale Demonstration, Inc., hoping to lead the country to an alternative energy source to end American reliance on oil during the energy crisis caused by the [[Arab Oil Embargo]].

He proudly took part in the [[Sagebrush Rebellion]], a western philosophy popular from 1979&amp;ndash;1982 that attempted to reclaim some federally protected land for determination by states and local governments.

Aspinall resumed the practice of law, was a resident of Palisade, Colo., until his death there October 9, 1983; he was [[Cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were interred at Orchard Mesa Municipal Cemetery, [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]. The United States Post Office and Courthouse in Grand Junction was renamed the [[Wayne N. Aspinall Federal Building]] in 1972.
