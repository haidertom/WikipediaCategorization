[[File:PICT0111.JPG|thumb|[[direct current|DC]] [[plasma physics|plasma]] (violet) enhances the growth of carbon nanotubes in laboratory-scale PECVD apparatus]]

'''Chemical vapor deposition''' ('''CVD''') is a deposition method used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials, typically under [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum]]. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.

In typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.

== Types ==
[[File:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]
[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** ''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** ''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment|publisher=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** ''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** ''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** ''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]]):
** ''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
** ''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavares|first=Jason|author2=Swanson, E.J. |author3=Coulombe, S. |title=Plasma Synthesis of Coated Metal Nanoparticles with Surface Properties Tailored for Dispersion|journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers|year=2008|volume=5|issue=8|page=759|doi=10.1002/ppap.200800074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
* ''Atomic-layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
* ''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
* ''Hot filament CVD'' (HFCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or more commonly, initiated CVD (iCVD), this process uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=R.E.I. | last=Schropp |author2=B. Stannowski |author3=A.M. Brockhoff |author4=P.A.T.T. van Veenendaal |author5=J.K.

* ''[[Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (HPCVD) – This process involves both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and [[vaporization]] of a solid source.
* ''[[Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]]'' (MOCVD) – This CVD process is based on [[metalorganic]] precursors.
* ''Rapid thermal CVD'' (RTCVD) – This CVD process uses heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions that can lead to [[particle (ecology)|particle]] formation.
* ''Vapor-phase epitaxy'' (VPE)
* ''Photo-initiated CVD'' (PICVD) – This process uses UV light to stimulate chemical reactions. It is similar to plasma processing, given that plasmas are strong emitters of UV radiation. Under certain conditions, PICVD can be operated at or near atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorval Dion|first=C.A.|author2=Tavares, J.R.|title=Photo-Initiated Chemical Vapour Deposition as a Scalable Particle Functionalization Technology (A Practical Review)|journal=Powder Technology|volume=239|pages=484–491|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2013.02.024|url=https://zenodo.org/record/968600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Laser Chemical vapor deposition]] (LCVD)'' - This CVD process uses lasers to heat spots or lines on a substrate in semiconductor applications. In MEMS and in fiber production the lasers are used rapidly to break down the precursor gas-process temperature can exceed 2000oC-to build up a solid structure in much the same way as laser sintering based 3-D printers build up solids from powders.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways  that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is used in some [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and  photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices.  Certain [[carbide]]s and [[nitride]]s confer wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, Georg ''et al.''

==Commercially important materials prepared by CVD==

=== Polysilicon ===
[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is deposited from [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply "oxide" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:&lt;ref name="cao:2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C, dichlorosilane at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or "[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] ("P-glass") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&amp;nbsp;°C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&amp;nbsp;°C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===
CVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper is typically deposited by [[electroplating]]. Aluminum can be deposited from [[triisobutylaluminium]] (TIBAL) and related [[organoaluminium compound]]s.

CVD for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel is widely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

[[Niobium(V) oxide]] layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] with the loss of [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source
The most popular carbon source used to produce graphene is methane gas. Less popular choices include petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of three-dimensional graphene from petroleum asphalt by chemical vapor deposition|journal = Materials Letters|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 285–288|volume = 122|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2014.02.077|first = Zhuchen|last = Liu|first2 = Zhiqiang|last2 = Tu|first3 = Yongfeng|last3 = Li|first4 = Fan|last4 = Yang|first5 = Shuang|last5 = Han|first6 = Wang|last6 = Yang|first7 = Liqiang|last7 = Zhang|first8 = Gang|last8 = Wang|first9 = Chunming|last9 = Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel synthesis route to graphene using iron nanoparticles|journal = Journal of Materials Research|date = 2014|pages = 1522–1527|volume = 29|issue = 14|doi = 10.1557/jmr.2014.165|first = Rajen B.|last = Patel|first2 = Chi|last2 = Yu|first3 = Tsengming|last3 = Chou|first4 = Zafar|last4 = Iqbal|bibcode = 2014JMatR..29.1522P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or situated at some distance away at the deposition area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct synthesis of large area graphene on insulating substrate by gallium vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015|pages = 093112|volume = 106|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4914114|first = Katsuhisa|last = Murakami|first2 = Shunsuke|last2 = Tanaka|first3 = Ayaka|last3 = Hirukawa|first4 = Takaki|last4 = Hiyama|first5 = Tomoya|last5 = Kuwajima|first6 = Emi|last6 = Kano|first7 = Masaki|last7 = Takeguchi|first8 = Jun-ichi|last8 = Fujita|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.106i3112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.

* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene using urea|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy|date = 2015-09-05|pages = 1–6|volume = 58|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s11433-015-5717-0|first = CanKun|last = Zhang|first2 = WeiYi|last2 = Lin|first3 = ZhiJuan|last3 = Zhao|first4 = PingPing|last4 = Zhuang|first5 = LinJie|last5 = Zhan|first6 = YingHui|last6 = Zhou|first7 = WeiWei|last7 = Cai|bibcode = 2015SCPMA..58.7801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of CVD-graphene on rapidly heated copper foils|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3nr06434d|journal = Nanoscale|volume = 6|issue = 9|pages = 4728–34|doi = 10.1039/c3nr06434d|pmid = 24658264|first = Sang-Min|last = Kim|first2 = Jae-Hyun|last2 = Kim|first3 = Kwang-Seop|last3 = Kim|first4 = Yun|last4 = Hwangbo|first5 = Jong-Hyuk|last5 = Yoon|first6 = Eun-Kyu|last6 = Lee|first7 = Jaechul|last7 = Ryu|first8 = Hak-Joo|last8 = Lee|first9 = Seungmin|last9 = Cho|bibcode = 2014Nanos...6.4728K|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some still use APCVD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800–1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Nucleation and growth of single layer graphene on electrodeposited Cu by cold wall chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=105601|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa593b|pmid=28084218|bibcode=2017Nanot..28j5601D|year=2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895408/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Pre-coalescence scaling of graphene island sizes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=28 May 2018|volume=123|issue=20|pages=205306|doi=10.1063/1.5021341|bibcode=2018JAP...123t5306D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===

CVD can be used to produce a [[synthetic diamond]] by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145–3.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5–203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.&lt;ref name="poly1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heat2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647–1653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word "diamond" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single crystal diamond can be made containing various [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2003.10.017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223368741|title=Single crystal diamond for electronic applications|year=2004|last1=Isberg|first1=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=320–324|bibcode = 2004DRM....13..320I }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic diamond#Crystallinity|Polycrystalline diamond]] consisting of grain sizes from several [[nanometer]]s to several [[micrometre|micrometers]] can be grown.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00385-5|title=Ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films for MEMS and moving mechanical assembly devices|year=2001|last1=Krauss|first1=A|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1952–1961|bibcode = 2001DRM....10.1952K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
The '''Dirac sea''' is a theoretical model of the [[vacuum]] as an infinite sea of particles with [[negative energy]]. It was first postulated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[physicist]] [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the anomalous negative-energy [[quantum state]]s predicted by the [[Dirac equation]] for [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positron]], the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]], was originally conceived of as a [[electron hole|hole]] in the Dirac sea, well before its experimental discovery in 1932.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This was not the original intent of Dirac though, as the title of his 1930 paper (''A Theory of Electrons and Protons'') indicates. But it soon afterwards became clear that the mass of holes must be that of the electron.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon solving the free Dirac equation,

:&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = (c\hat \boldsymbol \alpha \cdot \hat \boldsymbol p + mc^2\hat \beta)\Psi,&lt;/math&gt;

one finds&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|pp=107&amp;ndash;109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{\mathbf p\lambda} = N\left(\begin{matrix}U\\ \frac{(c\hat \boldsymbol \sigma \cdot \boldsymbol p)}{mc^2 + \lambda E_p}U\end{matrix}\right)\frac{\exp[i(\mathbf p \cdot \mathbf x - \varepsilon t)/\hbar]}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \pm E_p, \quad E_p = +c\sqrt{\mathbf p^2 + m^2 c^2}, \quad \lambda = \sgn \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

for plane wave solutions with {{math|3}}-momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. This is a direct consequence of the relativistic [[energy-momentum relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4&lt;/math&gt;

upon which the Dirac equation is built. The quantity {{mvar|U}} is a constant {{math|2 × 1}} column vector and {{mvar|N}} is a normalization constant. The quantity {{math|''ε''}} is called the ''time evolution factor'', and its interpretation in similar roles in, for example, the [[plane wave]] solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]], is the energy of the wave (particle). This interpretation is not immediately available here since it may acquire negative values. A similar situation prevails for the [[Klein&amp;ndash;Gordon equation]]. In that case, the ''absolute value'' of {{math|''ε''}} can be interpreted as the energy of the wave since in the canonical formalism, waves with negative {{math|''ε''}} actually have ''positive'' energy {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this is not the case with the Dirac equation. The energy in the canonical formalism associated with negative {{math|''ε''}} is {{math|–''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greiner|2000|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hole theory, the solutions with negative time evolution factors are reinterpreted as representing the [[positron]], discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. The interpretation of this result requires a Dirac sea, showing that the Dirac equation is not merely a combination of [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], but it also implies that the number of particles cannot be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alvarez-Gaume|Vazquez-Mozo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The origins of the Dirac sea lie in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy spectrum]] of the [[Dirac equation]], an extension of the [[Schrödinger equation]] that is consistent with [[special relativity]], that Dirac had formulated in 1928. Although the equation was extremely successful in describing electron dynamics, it possesses a rather peculiar feature: for each quantum state possessing a positive energy ''E'', there is a corresponding state with energy ''-E''. This is not a big difficulty when an isolated electron is considered, because its energy is [[conservation of energy|conserved]] and negative-energy electrons may be left out. However, difficulties arise when effects of the [[electromagnetic field]] are considered, because a positive-energy electron would be able to shed energy by continuously emitting [[photon]]s, a process that could continue without limit as the electron descends into lower and lower energy states. Real electrons clearly do not behave in this way.

Dirac's solution to this was to turn to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Electrons are [[fermion]]s, and obey the exclusion principle, which means that no two electrons can share a single energy state within an atom. Dirac hypothesized that what we think of as the "vacuum" is actually the state in which ''all'' the negative-energy states are filled, and none of the positive-energy states. Therefore, if we want to introduce a single electron we would have to put it in a positive-energy state, as all the negative-energy states are occupied. Furthermore, even if the electron loses energy by emitting photons it would be forbidden from dropping below zero energy.

Dirac also pointed out that a situation might exist in which all the negative-energy states are occupied except one. This "hole" in the sea of negative-energy electrons would respond to [[electric field]]s as though it were a positively charged particle. Initially, Dirac identified this hole as a [[proton]]. However, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] pointed out that an electron and its hole would be able to [[annihilation|annihilate]] each other, releasing energy on the order of the electron's rest energy in the form of energetic photons; if holes were protons, stable [[atom]]s would not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Weyl]] also noted that a hole should act as though it has the same [[mass]] as an electron, whereas the proton is about two thousand times heavier. The issue was finally resolved in 1932 when the [[positron]] was discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]], with all the physical properties predicted for the Dirac hole.

== Inelegance of Dirac sea ==

Despite its success, the idea of the Dirac sea tends not to strike people as very elegant. The existence of the sea implies an infinite positive electric charge filling all of space. In order to make any sense out of this, one must assume that the "bare vacuum" must have an infinite negative charge density which is exactly cancelled by the Dirac sea. Since the absolute energy density is unobservable—the [[cosmological constant]] aside—the infinite energy density of the vacuum does not represent a problem. Only changes in the energy density are observable.  Geoffrey Landis (author of ''Ripples In The Dirac Sea'', a hard science fiction short story) also notes{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} that Pauli exclusion does not definitively mean that a filled Dirac sea cannot accept more electrons, since, as [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel|Hilbert]] elucidated, a sea of infinite extent can accept new particles even if it is filled. This happens when we have a [[chiral anomaly]] and a gauge [[instanton]].

The development of [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) in the 1930s made it possible to reformulate the Dirac equation in a way that treats the positron as a "real" particle rather than the absence of a particle, and makes the vacuum the state in which no particles exist instead of an infinite sea of particles. This picture is much more convincing, especially since it recaptures all the valid predictions of the Dirac sea, such as electron-positron annihilation. On the other hand, the field formulation does not eliminate all the difficulties raised by the Dirac sea; in particular the problem of the [[vacuum energy|vacuum possessing infinite energy]].

== Modern interpretation ==

The Dirac sea interpretation and the modern QFT interpretation are related by what may be thought of as a very simple [[Bogoliubov transformation]], an identification between the creation and annihilation operators of two different free field theories.{{citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=phrasing suggestive of original research}} In the modern interpretation, the field operator for a Dirac  spinor is a sum of creation operators and annihilation operators, in a schematic notation:

::&lt;math&gt; \psi(x) = \sum a^\dagger(k) e^{ikx} + a(k)e^{-ikx} &lt;/math&gt;

An operator with negative frequency lowers the energy of any state by an amount proportional to the frequency, while operators with positive frequency raise the energy of any state.

In the modern interpretation, the positive frequency operators add a positive energy particle, adding to the energy, while the negative frequency operators annihilate a positive energy particle, and lower the energy. For a [[Fermionic field]], the [[Creation and annihilation operators|creation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a^\dagger (k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is already filled, while the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a(k)&lt;/math&gt; gives zero when the state with momentum k is empty.

But then it is possible to reinterpret the annihilation operator as a ''creation'' operator for a [[negative energy]] particle. It still lowers the energy of the vacuum, but in this point of view it does so by creating a negative energy object. This reinterpretation only affects the philosophy. To reproduce the rules for when annihilation in the vacuum gives zero, the notion of "empty" and "filled" must be reversed for the negative energy states. Instead of being states with no antiparticle, these are states that are already filled with a negative energy particle.

The price is that there is a nonuniformity in certain expressions, because replacing annihilation with creation adds a constant to the negative energy particle number. The [[number operator]] for a Fermi field&lt;ref name="Sattler"&gt;{{harvnb|Sattler|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt; N = a^\dagger a = 1 - a a^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;

which means that if one replaces N by 1-N for [[negative energy]] states, there is a constant shift in quantities like the energy and the charge density, quantities that count the total number of particles. The infinite constant gives the Dirac sea an infinite energy and charge density. The vacuum charge density should be zero, since the vacuum is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]], but this is artificial to arrange in Dirac's picture. The way it is done is by passing to the modern interpretation.

Dirac's idea is more directly applicable to [[solid state physics]], where the [[valence band]] in a [[solid]] can be regarded as a "sea" of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of [[semiconductor]]s, though they are never referred to as "positrons". Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge&amp;nbsp;— the charge of the [[Crystal structure|ionic lattice]]&amp;nbsp;— that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.

== Revival in the theory of causal fermion systems ==
Dirac's original concept of a sea of particles was revived in the theory of [[causal fermion system]]s, a recent proposal for a unified physical theory. In this approach, the problems of the infinite [[vacuum energy]] and infinite charge density of the Dirac sea disappear because these divergences drop out of the physical equations formulated via the [[causal action principle]].&lt;ref name="srev"&gt;{{harvnb|Finster|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These equations do not require a preexisting space-time, making it possible to realize the concept that space-time and all structures therein arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and "holes" in the sea.

The '''Drakoo wave energy converter'''  is a technological device that uses the motion of [[ocean surface waves]] to generate electricity.

== Principle ==
The Drakoo WEC does not fall under any of the usual [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] classifications: its working principle, based on a twin-chamber oscillating water column system, is to transform waves into a continuous water flow which drives a hydro turbine generator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
after being patented in 2008, the Drakoo technology has successfully been tested in NTU lab and, subsequently, in the deep wave flume of NAREC in 2012(UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report2014.ocean-energy-systems.org/country-reports/singapore/technology-demonstration/|title=Ocean Energy System Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocean Energy Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2016, Hann Ocean Energy, the Singapore wave developer company which invented and patented the technology, announced the first successful power production during a trial in its testing facility in [[Nantong]], with a peak power output of 3.8&amp;nbsp;kW at a wave height of 0.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology continuously increased its performances along the years, reaching firstly a peak output power of 9.3&amp;nbsp;kW  in November 2017 and of 11.2&amp;nbsp;kW in March 2018. Moreover, during the [[World Future Energy Summit]] 2018, in Abu Dhabi, Hann Ocean Energy reported about sales inquiries from the Persian Gulf for the application of the Drakoo WEC for wellhead platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The brightest-yellow areas are the hottest and are emitting the most energy out to space, while the dark blue areas and the bright white clouds are much colder, emitting the least energy.]]

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==
[[File:Diagram showing the Earth's energy budget, which includes the greenhouse effect (NASA).png|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption and image description|250px|Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth's atmosphere, which includes the greenhouse effect]]
{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]].

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fusion energy gain factor''', usually expressed with the symbol '''''Q''''', is the ratio of [[fusion power]] produced in a [[nuclear fusion]] reactor to the power required to maintain the [[Plasma physics|plasma]]  in [[steady state]]. The condition of ''Q'' = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as '''breakeven'''.

The power given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to ''self-heating''. Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at ''Q'' = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least ''Q'' = 5. If ''Q'' increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called '''ignition'''. Ignition corresponds to infinite ''Q'', and is generally regarded as highly desirable for a practical reactor design.

Over time, several related terms have entered the fusion lexicon. As a reactor does not cover its own heating losses until about ''Q'' = 5, the term '''engineering breakeven''' is sometimes used to describe a reactor that produces enough electricity to provide that heating. Above engineering breakeven a machine would produce more electricity than it uses, and could sell that excess. A machine that can sell enough electricity to cover its operating costs, estimated to require at least ''Q'' = 20, is sometimes known as '''economic breakeven'''.

{{Asof|2017}}, the record for ''Q'' is held by the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] tokamak in the UK, at ''Q'' = (16 MW)/(24 MW) ≈ 0.67, first attained in 1997. [[ITER]] was originally designed to reach ignition, but is currently designed to reach ''Q'' = 10, producing 500&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion power from 50&amp;nbsp;MW of injected thermal power.

==Concept==
''Q'' is simply the comparison of the [[Fusion power|power]] being released by the fusion reactions in a reactor, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, to the constant heating power being supplied, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there are several definitions of breakeven that consider additional power losses.

===Breakeven===
In 1955, [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|John Lawson]] was the first to explore the energy balance mechanisms in detail, initially in classified works but published openly in a now-famous 1957 paper. In this paper he considered and refined work by earlier researchers, notably [[Hans Thirring]], [[Peter Thonemann]], and a review article by [[Richard Post]]. Expanding on all of these, Lawson's paper made detailed predictions for the amount of power that would be lost through various mechanisms, and compared that to the energy needed to sustain the reaction.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} This balance is today known as the [[Lawson criterion]].

In a successful fusion reactor design, the fusion reactions generate an amount of power designated ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.{{efn|This was denoted ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in Lawson's original paper, but changed here to match modern terminology.}} Some amount of this energy, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;, is lost through a variety of mechanisms, mostly convection of the fuel to the walls of the reactor chamber and various forms of radiation that cannot be captured to generate power. In order to keep the reaction going, the system has to provide heating to make up for these losses, where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain thermal equilibrium.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|pp=8-9}}

The most basic definition of breakeven is when ''Q'' = 1,{{efn|In Lawson's original paper, the term ''Q'' was used to denote the total energy released by the individual fusion reactions, in MeV, and ''R'' referred to the power balance.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} Later works used ''Q'' to refer to the power balance, as it is used in this article.}} that is, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some works refer to this definition as '''scientific breakeven''', to contrast it with similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Nuclear Society |url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/fst/a_22885 |title= The Mirror Fusion Test Facility: An Intermediate Device to a Mirror Fusion Reactor  |first=V. N. |last=Karpenko |volume=4 |number=2P2 |date=September 1983 |doi=10.13182/FST83-A22885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= 17th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/event/rcn/9860_en.html | date =19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is rare outside certain areas, specifically the [[inertial confinement fusion]] field, where the term is much more widely used.

===Extrapolated breakeven===
Since the 1950s, most commercial fusion reactor designs have been based on a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] as their primary fuel; others fuels have been studied for a variety of reasons but are much harder to ignite. As tritium is radioactive, highly bioactive and highly mobile, it represents a significant safety concern and adds to the cost of designing and operating such a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/ |title=Fusion reactors: Not what they’re cracked up to be |date=19 April 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Jassby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower costs, many experimental machines are designed to run on test fuels of hydrogen or deuterium alone, leaving out the tritium. In this case, the term '''extrapolated breakeven''' is used to define the expected performance of the machine running on D-T fuel based on the performance when running on hydrogen or deuterium alone.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ees.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~web_dai5/english/B.html |title=Plasma Dictionary |website=Nagoya University |first= M. A. |last=Razzak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records for extrapolated breakeven are slightly higher than the records for scientific breakeven. Both JET and JT-60 have reached values around 1.25 (see below for details) while running on D-D fuel. When running on D-T, only possible in JET, the maximum performance is about half the extrapolated value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

===Engineering breakeven===
Another related term, '''engineering breakeven''', considers the need to extract the energy from the reactor, turn that into electrical energy, and feed that back into the heating system.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This closed loop is known as ''recirculation''. In this case, the basic definition changes by adding additional terms to the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; side to consider the efficiencies of these processes.

Most fusion reactions release energy in a variety of forms, mostly [[neutron]]s and a variety of charged particles like [[alpha particle]]s. Neutrons are electrically neutral and will travel out of any [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MFE) design, and in spite of the very high densities found in [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) designs, they tend to easily escape the fuel mass in these designs as well. This means that only the charged particles from the reactions can be captured within the fuel mass and give rise to self-heating. If the fraction of the energy being released in the charged particles is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, then the power in these particles is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. If this self-heating process is perfect, that is, all of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; is captured in the fuel, that means the power available for generating electricity is the power that is not released in that form, or (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the case of neutrons carrying most of the practical energy, as is the case in the D-T fuel studied in most designs, this neutron energy is normally captured in a "blanket" of  [[lithium]] that produces more tritium that is used to fuel the reactor. Due to various [[exothermic]] and [[endothermic]] reactions, the blanket may have a power gain factor a few percent higher or lower than 100%, but that will be neglected here. The blanket is then cooled and the [[cooling fluid]] used in a [[heat exchanger]] driving conventional [[steam turbine]]s. These have an efficiency η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; which is around 35 to 40%.

Consider a system that uses external heaters to heat the fusion fuel, then extracts the power from those reactions to generate electrical power. Some fraction of that power, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;, is needed to recirculate back into the heaters to close the loop. This is not the same as the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; because the self-heating processes are providing some of the required energy. While the system as a whole requires additional power for building climate control, lighting, and the confinement system, these are generally much smaller than the plasma heating system requirements.
 
Considering all of these factors, the heating power can thus be related to the fusion power by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;P_{heat} = \eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})\cdot P_{fus}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency that power supplied to the heating systems is turned into heat in the fuel, as opposed to lost in the equipment itself, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_{elec}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency achieved when turning the heat into electrical power, for instance, through the [[Rankine cycle]].

The fusion energy gain factor is then defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Q_E \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})} &lt;/math&gt;

===Ignition===
As the temperature of the plasma increases, the rate of fusion reactions grows rapidly, and with it, the rate of self heating. In contrast, the non-capturable energy losses like x-rays do not grow at the same rate. Thus, in overall terms, the self-heating process becomes more efficient as the temperature increases, and less energy is needed from external sources to keep it hot.

Eventually ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; reaches zero, that is, all of the energy needed to keep the plasma at the operational temperature is being supplied by self-heating, and the amount of external energy that needs to be added drops to zero. This point is known as '''ignition'''.

Ignition, by definition, corresponds to an infinite ''Q'', but it does not mean that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; drops to zero as the other power sinks in the system, like the magnets and cooling systems, still need to be powered. Generally, however, these are much smaller than the energy in the heaters, and require a much smaller ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, this number is more likely to be near constant, meaning that further improvements in plasma performance will result in more energy that can be directly used for commercial generation, as opposed to recirculation.

===Commercial breakeven===
The final definition of breakeven is '''commercial breakeven''', which occurs when the economic value of any net energy left over after recirculation is enough to finance the construction of the reactor.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This value depends both on the reactor and the [[spot price]] of electrical power.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary |website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial breakeven relies on factors outside the technology of the reactor itself, and it is possible that even a reactor with a fully ignited plasma will not generate enough energy to pay for itself. Whether any of the mainline concepts like [[ITER]] can reach this goal is being debated in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://issues.org/31-4/fusion-research-time-to-set-a-new-path/ |title=Fusion Research: Time to Set a New Path |first=Robert |last=Hirsch |date=Summer 2015 |magazine=Issues in Technology |volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical example==
Most fusion reactor designs being studied {{asof|2017|lc=yes}} are based on the D-T reaction, as this is by far the easiest to ignite, and is energy dense. However, this reaction also gives off most of its energy in the form of a single highly energetic neutron, and only 20% of the energy in the form of an alpha. Thus, for the D-T reaction, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2. This means that self-heating does not become equal to the external heating until at least ''Q'' = 5. 

Efficiency values depend on design details but may be in the range of η&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7 (70%) and η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.4 (40%). The purpose of a fusion reactor is to produce power, not to recirculate it, so a practical reactor must have ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 approximately. Lower would be better but will be hard to achieve. Using these values we find for a practical reactor ''Q'' = 22.

==Transient vs. continual==
Many early fusion devices operated for microseconds, using some sort of pulsed power source to feed their [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]] system and used the confinement as the heating source. Lawson defined breakeven in this context as the total energy released by the entire reaction cycle compared to the total energy supplied to the machine during the same cycle.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Over time, as performance increased by orders of magnitude, the reaction times have extended from microseconds to seconds, and in [[ITER]], on the order of minutes. In this case definition of "the entire reaction cycle" becomes blurred. In the case of an ignited plasma, for instance, P&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; may be quite high while the system is being set up, and then drop to zero when it is fully developed, so one may be tempted to pick an instant in time when it is operating at its best to determine ''Q''. A better solution in these cases is to use the original Lawson definition averaged over the reaction to produce a similar value as the original definition.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

However, there is a complication. During the heating phase when the system is being brought up to operational conditions, some of the energy released by the fusion reactions will be used to heat the surrounding fuel, and thus not be released. This is no longer true when the plasma reaches its operational temperature and enters thermal equilibrium. Thus, if one averages over the entire cycle, this energy will be included as part of the heating term, that is, some of the energy that was captured for heating would otherwise have been released in P&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; and is therefore not indicative of an operational ''Q''.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Operators of the JET reactor argued that this input should be removed from the total:

&lt;math&gt; Q* \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat} - P_{temp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt; P_{temp} = \frac{dWp}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, P&lt;sub&gt;temp&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of energy needed to raise the internal energy of the plasma. It is this definition that was used when reporting JET's record 0.67 value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Some debate over this definition continues. In 1998, the operators of the [[JT-60]] claimed to have reached ''Q'' = 1.25 running on D-D fuel, thus reaching extrapolated breakeven. However, this measurement was based on the JET definition of Q*. Using this definition, JET had also reached extrapolated breakeven some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |title=JT-60U Reaches 1.25 of Equivalent Fusion Power Gain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106002827/http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |archive-date=6 January 2013 |date=7 August 1998 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one considers the energy balance in these conditions, and the analysis of previous machines, it is argued the original definition should be used, and thus both machines remain well below break-even of any sort.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

==Scientific breakeven at NIF==
Although most fusion experiments use some form of magnetic confinement, another major branch is [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) that mechanically presses together the fuel mass (the "target") to increase its density. This greatly increases the rate of fusion events and lowers the need to confine the fuel for long periods. This compression is accomplished by heating a lightweight capsule holding the fuel so rapidly that it explodes outwards, driving the fuel mass on the inside inward in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. There are a variety of proposed "drivers" to cause the implosion process, but to date most experiments have used [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://kfe.fjfi.cvut.cz/~limpouch/plazma/Pfalzner_Introduction_ICF.pdf |title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion |first=S. |last=Pfalzner |publisher=CRC Press |date=2006 |pages=13-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using the traditional definition of ''Q'', ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;, ICF devices have extremely low ''Q''. This is because the laser is extremely inefficient; whereas &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; for the heaters used in magnetic systems might be on the order of 70%, lasers are on the order of 1.5%. For this reason, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the leader in ICF research, has proposed another modification of ''Q'' that defines ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; as the energy delivered by the driver, as opposed to the energy put into the driver. This definition produces much higher ''Q'' values, and changes the definition of breakeven to be ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;laser&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. On occasion, they referred to this definition as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Status of the NIF Project |first=Edward |last=Moses |date=4 May 2007 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Optics |first=H.

On 7 October 2013, the BBC announced that LLNL had achieved scientific breakeven in the [[National Ignition Facility]]  (NIF) on 29 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24429621 |date=7 October 2013 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-experiment-extracts-net-energy-from-fuel-1.14710 |title=Laser fusion experiment extracts net energy from fuel |first=Philip |last=Ball |date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=HiPER |url=http://www.hiper-laser.org/News%20and%20events/index.html |title=Latest Fusion Results from the National Ignition Facility |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; was approximately 14&amp;nbsp;kJ, while the laser output was 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ. By their previous definition, this would be a ''Q'' of 0.0077. However, for this press release, they re-defined ''Q'' once again, this time equating ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to be only the amount energy delivered to "the hottest portion of the fuel", calculating that only 10&amp;nbsp;kJ of the original laser energy reached the part of the fuel that was undergoing fusion reactions. This release has been heavily criticized in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=FIRE |url=https://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Science |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF?

[[File:Red Giant Earth warm.jpg|thumb|274x274px|alt=A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun|Conjectured illustration of the scorched [[Earth]] after the [[Sun]] has entered the [[red giant]] phase, about 7 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;]]

The biological and geological '''future of Earth''' can be [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] based upon the estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at [[Earth]]'s surface, the rate of [[Thermal history of the Earth|cooling of the planet's interior]], the [[perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational interactions]] with other objects in the [[Solar System]], and a steady increase in the [[solar luminosity|Sun's luminosity]]. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as [[climate engineering]],&lt;ref name=aree25_245/&gt; which could cause significant changes to the planet.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The current [[Holocene extinction]]&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt; is being caused by technology{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} and the effects may last for up to five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} In turn, technology may result in the [[extinction of humanity]], leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years, random celestial events pose a global risk to the [[biosphere]], which can result in [[mass extinction]]s. These include impacts by [[comet]]s or [[asteroid]]s, and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion, called a [[supernova]], within a 100-[[light-year]] radius of the Sun. Other large-scale geological events are more predictable. [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that the planet will continue to undergo [[glacial period]]s at least until the [[Quaternary glaciation]] comes to an end. These periods are caused by variations in [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], [[axial tilt]], and [[precession]] of the Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; As part of the ongoing [[supercontinent cycle]], [[plate tectonics]] will probably result in a [[supercontinent]] in 250–350&amp;nbsp;million years. Some time in the next 1.5–4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90°.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

The luminosity of the [[Sun]] will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the [[solar radiation]] reaching the Earth. This will result in a higher rate of [[weathering]] of [[silicate mineral]]s, which will cause a decrease in the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. In about 600&amp;nbsp;million years from now, the level of carbon dioxide will fall below the level needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation photosynthesis]] used by trees. Some plants use the [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] method, allowing them to persist at carbon dioxide concentrations as low as 10 parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the base of the [[food chain]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present. This will cause the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a [[Positive feedback|runaway]] evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; Following this event, in about 2−3 billion years, the planet's [[Dynamo theory|magnetic dynamo]] may cease, causing the [[magnetosphere]] to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of [[volatiles]] from the outer atmosphere. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a [[runaway greenhouse effect]], heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Fishbaugh|Des_Marais|Korablev|Raulin|2007|p=114}} The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, after the star has entered the [[red giant]] phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit.

== Human influence ==
{{Main|Conservation biology|Global warming|Human impact on the environment}}

Humans play a key role in the [[biosphere]], with the large [[human population]] dominating many of Earth's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt; This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of other [[species]] during the present geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], now known as the [[Holocene extinction]]. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a [[biotic crisis]], with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007.{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of [[extinction]] in the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=Novacek/&gt; The Holocene extinction event is the result of [[habitat destruction]], the widespread distribution of [[invasive species]], hunting, and [[climate change]].{{sfn|Cowie|2007|p=162}}&lt;ref name=nature04/&gt; In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;

The consequences of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last for at least five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} It could result in a decline in [[biodiversity]] and homogenization of [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are [[Opportunism|opportunistic]], such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular [[taxa]] that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. [[Microorganism|Microbes]] are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large [[vertebrate]]s are likely to arise and [[food chains]] will probably be shortened.&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas01/&gt;

There are [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|multiple scenarios for known risks]] that can have a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and [[Human extinction|terminal risks]]. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the [[Grey goo|misuse of nanotechnology]], a [[nuclear holocaust]], warfare with a programmed [[superintelligence]], a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a [[Doomsday argument|doomsday]] threat, including a highly [[virulent]] disease, the [[Impact event|impact of an asteroid or comet]], [[runaway greenhouse effect]], and [[resource depletion]]. There may also be the possibility of an infestation by an [[extraterrestrial life]]form.&lt;ref name=telegraph20100410/&gt; The actual odds of these scenarios occurring are difficult if not impossible to deduce.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Should the human race become extinct, then the various features assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay [[half-life]] of about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the [[Giza Necropolis]] or the sculptures at [[Mount Rushmore]] may still survive in some form after a million years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;{{efn|See also: [[Life After People]], about the decay of structures (if humans disappeared).}}

==Random events==
[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Barringer Meteorite Crater]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], showing evidence of the impact of celestial objects upon the Earth]]
As the Sun orbits the [[Milky Way]], wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=qjras35_1_1/&gt; A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the [[perihelion]] distances of comets in the [[Oort cloud]]&amp;mdash;a spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a [[light year]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=aaa112_1_157/&gt; Such an encounter can trigger a 40-fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System. Impacts from these comets can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth. These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every 45 million years.&lt;ref name=apjl499_L219/&gt; The mean time for the Sun to [[Stellar collision|collide]] with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; years}}, which is much longer than the estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy, at {{nowrap|~1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years}}. This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring during the lifetime of the Earth.{{sfn|Tayler|1993|p=92}}

The energy release from the impact of an [[asteroid]] or comet with a diameter of {{convert|5|–|10|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger is sufficient to create a global [[environmental disaster]] and cause a [[statistically significant]] increase in the number of species extinctions. Among the deleterious effects resulting from a major impact event is a cloud of fine dust ejecta blanketing the planet, blocking some [[Diffuse sky radiation|direct sunlight]] from reaching the Earth's surface thus lowering land temperatures by about {{convert|15|C-change|F-change}} within a week and halting [[photosynthesis]] for several months (similar to a [[nuclear winter]]). The mean time between major impacts is estimated to be at least 100 million&amp;nbsp;years. During the last 540 million&amp;nbsp;years, simulations demonstrated that such an impact rate is sufficient to cause 5–6 mass extinctions and 20–30 lower severity events. This matches the geologic record of significant extinctions during the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. Such events can be expected to continue into the future.&lt;ref name=emp72_1_441/&gt;

A [[supernova]] is a cataclysmic explosion of a star. Within the Milky Way [[galaxy]], supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years.&lt;ref name=Tammann1004/&gt; During the [[History of Earth|history of the Earth]], multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years; known as a [[near-Earth supernova]]. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with [[radioisotope]]s and possibly impact the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nar48_1_119/&gt; [[Gamma ray]]s emitted by a supernova react with [[nitrogen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[nitrous oxide]]s. These molecules cause a depletion of the [[ozone layer]] that protects the surface from [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation from the Sun. An increase in [[UV-B]] radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the [[phytoplankton]] that form the base of the oceanic [[food chain]]. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26&amp;nbsp;light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32&amp;nbsp;light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries.{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|pp=174–76}} Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one [[gamma ray burst]] that will have a significant impact on the planet's biosphere.&lt;ref name=ass336_2_287/&gt;

The incremental effect of [[gravitational perturbation]]s between the planets causes the inner Solar System as a whole to behave [[Chaos theory|chaotically]] over long time periods. This does not significantly affect the [[stability of the Solar System]] over intervals of a few million years or less, but over billions of years the orbits of the planets become unpredictable. Computer simulations of the Solar System's evolution over the next five billion years suggest that there is a small (less than 1%) chance that a collision could occur between Earth and either [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], or [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=nature459_817/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; During the same interval, the odds that the Earth will be scattered out of the Solar System by a passing star are on the order of one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. In such a scenario, the oceans would freeze solid within several million years, leaving only a few pockets of liquid water about {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground. There is a remote chance that the Earth will instead be captured by a passing [[binary star]] system, allowing the planet's biosphere to remain intact. The odds of this happening are about one chance in three million.{{sfn|Adams|2008|pp=33–44}}

==Orbit and rotation==
The gravitational perturbations of the other planets in the Solar System combine to modify the [[Earth's orbit|orbit of the Earth]] and the [[Earth's rotation|orientation of its spin axis]]. These changes can influence the planetary climate.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci289_5486/&gt;{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}}{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}}&lt;!-- This paragraph is a summary of the material below. --&gt; Despite such interactions, highly accurate simulations show that overall, Earth's orbit is likely to remain dynamically stable for billions of years into the future. In all 1,600 simulations, the planet's [[semimajor axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and [[orbital inclination|inclination]] remained nearly constant.&lt;ref name=Zeebe2015/&gt;

===Glaciation===
Historically, there have been cyclical [[ice age]]s in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in [[ocean circulation]] and [[continentality]] induced by [[plate tectonics]].{{sfn|Lunine|Lunine|1999|p=244}} The [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that [[glacial period]]s occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal [[orbital eccentricity]], a low [[axial tilt]] (or obliquity), and the alignment of [[summer solstice]] with the [[aphelion]].&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05.&lt;ref name=qsr10_4/&gt;&lt;ref name=maslin_ridgwell05/&gt; This is equivalent to a change of the [[semiminor axis]] of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the [[semimajor axis]] to 99.88%, respectively.&lt;ref name=weisstein03/&gt;

The Earth is passing through an ice age known as the [[quaternary glaciation]], and is presently in the [[Holocene]] [[interglacial period]]. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years.{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}} However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the [[atmosphere]] by humans may delay the onset of the next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a [[global warming]] period of finite duration (based on the assumption that [[fossil fuel]] use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of [[greenhouse gas]] emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;

===Obliquity===
[[File:Tidal braking.svg|thumb|alt=A small gray circle at the top represents the Moon. A green circle centered in a blue ellipse represents the Earth and its oceans. A curved arrow shows the counterclockwise direction of the Earth's rotation, resulting in the long axis of the ellipse being slightly out of alignment with the Moon.|The rotational offset of the [[tidal bulge]] exerts a net [[torque]] on the Moon, boosting it while slowing the [[Earth's rotation]] (not to scale).]]

The [[tidal acceleration]] of the [[Moon]] slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the [[Earth-Moon distance]]. Friction effects—between the [[Inner core|core]] and [[Earth mantle|mantle]] and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the [[Earth's rotation|length of the day]] by more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.&lt;ref name=aaa428/&gt;

Based on computer models, the presence of the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes.&lt;ref name=nature361/&gt; This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the [[precession]] rate of the Earth's spin axis, thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane (that is, the precession motion of the [[ecliptic]]).&lt;ref name=icarus168_2/&gt; However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

A high obliquity would probably result in dramatic changes in the climate and may destroy the planet's [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}} When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly [[insolation]] at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=gsl29_23/&gt;

==Geodynamics==
[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|right|250px|thumb|alt=An irregular green shape against a blue background represents Pangaea.|[[Pangaea]] was the last [[supercontinent]] to form before the present.]]

[[Tectonics]]-based events will continue to occur well into the future and the surface will be steadily reshaped by [[tectonic uplift]], [[Extrusive|extrusions]], and [[erosion]]. [[Mount Vesuvius]] can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the [[San Andreas Fault]], while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. [[Mauna Loa]] should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the [[Old Faithful Geyser]] will likely cease to operate. The [[Niagara Falls]] will continue to retreat upstream, reaching [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in about 30,000&amp;ndash;50,000 years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

In 10,000 years, the post-glacial rebound of the [[Baltic Sea]] will have reduced the depth by about {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Hudson Bay]] will decrease in depth by 100&amp;nbsp;m over the same period.&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; After 100,000 years, the island of [[Hawaii]] will have shifted about {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest. The planet may be entering another glacial period by this time.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

===Continental drift===
{{Further|Continental drift}}
The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a [[hydrosphere]]. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt.&lt;ref name="pr114_1" /&gt; The production of [[Radiogenic heat|heat through radiogenic processes]] is sufficient to maintain [[mantle convection]] and plate [[subduction]] for at least the next 1.1 billion years.&lt;ref name="pr118" /&gt;

At present, the continents of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are moving westward from [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} These [[geodynamic]] models can be distinguished by the [[subduction]] flux, whereby the [[oceanic crust]] moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, [[Atlantic ocean]] becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, [[Pacific ocean]] remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.&lt;ref name="gr15_3_4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science5859" /&gt;

As the understanding of [[geodynamics]] improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the [[mantle convection]] will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a [[supercontinent]] composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="pepi171_1_4" /&gt;

Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt;

====Introversion====
[[File:PangeaUltimaRoughEstimation.png|right|thumb|350px|A rough approximation of [[Pangaea Ultima]], one of the three models for a future supercontinent.]]
[[Christopher Scotese]] and his colleagues have mapped out the predicted motions several hundred million years into the future as part of the [[Paleomap Project]].{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} In their scenario, 50 million years from now the [[Mediterranean sea]] may vanish and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range extending to the current location of the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Australia]] will merge with [[Indonesia]], and [[Baja California]] will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. To the south, the migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of [[Antarctic ice sheet|its ice sheets]] to melt. This, along with the melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet]]s, will raise the average ocean level by {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The inland flooding of the continents will result in climate changes.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}}

As this scenario continues, by 100 million years from the present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around the southern tip of Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called [[Pangaea Ultima]]), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the [[South Pole]], building up a new ice cap.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=92–96}}

====Extroversion====
The first scientist to extrapolate the current motions of the continents was Canadian geologist [[Paul F. Hoffman]] of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about [[Siberia]] until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, [[Amasia (continent)|Amasia]].{{sfn|Nield|2007|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=323–27}} Later, in the 1990s, [[Roy Livermore]] calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and [[Madagascar]] would move across the [[Indian Ocean]] to collide with Asia.&lt;ref name=williams_nield/&gt;

In an extroversion model, the closure of the Pacific Ocean would be complete in about 350&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt; This marks the completion of the current [[supercontinent cycle]], wherein the continents split apart and then rejoin each other about every 400–500&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sa259_1/&gt; Once the supercontinent is built, plate tectonics may enter a period of inactivity as the rate of subduction drops by an [[order of magnitude]]. This period of stability could cause an increase in the mantle temperature at the rate of {{convert|30|-|100|C-change|F-change}} every 100&amp;nbsp;million years, which is the minimum lifetime of past supercontinents. As a consequence, [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] may increase.&lt;ref name=science5859/&gt;&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt;

====Supercontinent====
The formation of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in [[Orogenic uplift|mountain building]], thereby shifting weather patterns. [[Sea level]]s may fall because of increased glaciation.{{sfn|Calkin|Young|1996|pp=9–75}} The rate of surface [[weathering]] can rise, resulting in an increase in the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid [[biological evolution]] as new [[Ecological niche|niches]] emerge.{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

The formation of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent will split up once more.{{sfn|Palmer|2003|p=164}} The planet may then experience a warming period, as occurred during the [[Cretaceous period]].{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

===Solidification of the outer core===
The iron-rich core region of the Earth is divided into a {{convert|1220|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius solid [[inner core]] and a {{convert|3480|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius liquid [[outer core]].&lt;ref name=gjl156_2_363/&gt; The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies in the outer core region that cause it to function as a [[dynamo]].{{sfn|Gonzalez|Richards|2004|p=48}} This generates a [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetosphere]] about the Earth that deflects particles from the [[solar wind]], which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from [[sputtering]]. As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing [[thermal energy]] and causing the solid inner core to grow.&lt;ref name=nature473_361/&gt; This iron [[crystallization]] process has been ongoing for about a billion years. In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly {{convert|0.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} per year, at the expense of the outer core.&lt;ref name=science328_5981_1014/&gt; Nearly all of the energy needed to power the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation.&lt;ref name=pepi110_1_83/&gt;

The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other [[Heavy metals|heavy elements]]. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing.{{sfn|Meadows|2007|p=34}} Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the growth of the inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field of the Earth]] will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years.{{sfn|Stevenson|2002|p=605}} The loss of the [[magnetosphere]] will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly [[hydrogen]], from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.&lt;ref name=ssr129_1_167/&gt;

== Solar evolution ==
{{see also|Stellar evolution|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}

The energy generation of the Sun is based upon [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]]. This occurs in the core region of the star using the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] process. Because there is no [[Convection zone|convection]] in the [[solar core]], the [[helium]] concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature at the core of the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the [[triple-alpha process]], so these atoms do not contribute to the net energy generation that is needed to maintain [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

At present, nearly half the hydrogen at the core has been consumed, with the remainder of the atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

[[File:Solar evolution (English).svg|right|thumb|320px|Evolution of the Sun's [[Solar luminosity|luminosity]], [[Solar radius|radius]] and [[effective temperature]] compared to the present Sun. After Ribas (2010).&lt;ref name=ribas2010/&gt;]]
The result of this process has been a steady increase in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a [[main sequence]] star, it radiated only 70% of the current [[luminosity]]. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt; Likewise, in three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the [[subgiant star|subgiant]] stage and [[stellar evolution|evolve]] into a [[red giant]].&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;

By this time, the [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision|collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies]] should be underway. Although this could result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or its planets.&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cox2008/&gt;

=== Climate impact ===

{{See also|Medea hypothesis}}

The rate of weathering of [[silicate minerals]] will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid [[carbonate]]s. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of carbon dioxide will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive,&lt;ref name=heath_doyle09/&gt; the last living trees being evergreen [[conifer]]s.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] can continue at much lower concentrations, down to above 10 parts per million. Thus plants using {{c4}} photosynthesis may be able to survive for at least 0.8 billion years and possibly as long as 1.2 billion years from now, after which rising temperatures will make the biosphere unsustainable.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;&lt;ref name=tellus_b_52_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=grl28_9/&gt; Currently, {{c4}} plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and 1% of its known plant species.&lt;ref name=Bond2005/&gt; For example, about 50% of all grass species ([[Poaceae]]) use the {{c4}} photosynthetic [[metabolic pathway|pathway]],{{sfn|van der Maarel|2005|p=363}} as do many species in the herbaceous family [[Amaranthaceae]].&lt;ref name=ijps164_6/&gt;

When the levels of carbon dioxide fall to the limit where photosynthesis is barely sustainable, the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to oscillate up and down. This will allow land vegetation to flourish each time the level of carbon dioxide rises due to [[tectonic]] activity and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] from animal life. However, the long term trend is for the plant life on land to die off altogether as most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere becomes [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered]] in the Earth.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of carbon dioxide of a few parts per million, so these life forms would probably disappear only because of rising temperatures and the loss of the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;

Plants—and, by extension, animals—could survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes, becoming [[Carnivorous plant|carnivorous]], adapting to [[desiccation]], or [[mycoheterotrophy|associating with]] [[fungi]]. These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse (see [[Future of the Earth#Loss of oceans|further]]).&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

The loss of plant life will also result in the eventual loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions. This will result in less [[attenuation]] of [[DNA]]-damaging UV,&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; as well as the death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large [[mammal]]s, followed by small mammals, birds, [[amphibian]]s and large fish, [[reptile]]s and small fish, and finally [[invertebrate]]s. Before this happens, it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In their work ''The Life and Death of Planet Earth'', authors [[Peter D. Ward]] and [[Donald Brownlee]] have argued that some form of animal life may continue even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the [[Burgess Shale]] in [[British Columbia, Canada]], to determine the climate of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with [[Marine life|sea life]]. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from [[asphyxia]]tion within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}}

As temperatures continue to rise, the last of animal life will be driven toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the [[polar night]], [[aestivation|aestivating]] during the [[polar day]] due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily be found in the oceans.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} However, due to a decrease in the amount of organic matter entering the oceans from land as well as a decrease in [[Dissolved Oxygen|dissolved oxygen]],&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; sea life would disappear too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] species and conclude with invertebrates,&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as [[termite]]s or those near [[hydrothermal vents]] such as [[worm]]s of the genus ''[[Riftia]]''.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; As a result of these processes, [[Multicellular organism|multicellular life forms]] may be extinct in about 800 million years, and [[eukaryote]]s in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt;

=== Loss of oceans{{anchor|Ocean-free_era}} ===
[[File:Venuspioneeruv.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Light brown clouds wrap around a planet, as seen from space.|The [[atmosphere of Venus]] is in a "super-greenhouse" state.]]
One billion years from now, about 27% of the modern ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. If this process were allowed to continue uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface.&lt;ref name=hess5_4 /&gt; Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to {{convert|320|K|C F}}. The atmosphere will become a "moist greenhouse" leading to a [[Runaway greenhouse effect|runaway]] [[evaporation]] of the oceans.&lt;ref name=mnras386_1/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the [[stratosphere]] would contain increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through [[photodissociation]] by solar UV, allowing hydrogen to [[Atmospheric escape|escape the atmosphere]]. The net result would be a loss of the world's sea water by about 1.1 billion years from the present.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt;&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt; This will be a simple dramatic step in annihilating all life on Earth.

There will be two variations of this future warming feedback: the "moist greenhouse" where water vapor dominates the [[troposphere]] while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the "runaway greenhouse" where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). The Earth will undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over {{Cvt|900|C|F K}} as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life, perhaps in about 3 billion years. In this ocean-free era, there will continue to be surface reservoirs as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle,&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt; where it is estimated that there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}} Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rain storms, but for the most part the planet would be a dry desert with large [[dune]]fields covering its equator, and a few [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the [[Atacama Desert]] in Chile.&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt;

With no water to serve as a lubricant, plate tectonics would very likely stop and the most visible signs of geological activity would be [[shield volcano]]es located above mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}}&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multicellular life.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} Most of these microbes will be [[halophile]]s and life could find refuge in the atmosphere as [[Life on Venus#Recent speculation|has been proposed to have happened on Venus]].&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt; and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high [[latitude]]s and heights or in caverns with trapped ice. However, underground life could last longer.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; What proceeds this depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a "super-greenhouse" state like that of the planet [[Venus]]. But, as stated above, without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; until the Sun becomes a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}}

The loss of the oceans could be delayed until 2 billion years in the future if the [[atmospheric pressure]] were to decline. A lower atmospheric pressure would reduce the [[greenhouse effect]], thereby lowering the surface temperature. This could occur if [[Nitrogen cycle|natural processes were to remove the nitrogen from the atmosphere]]. Studies of organic sediments has shown that at least {{convert|100| kPa|atm|lk=on}} of nitrogen has been removed from the atmosphere over the past four billion years; enough to effectively double the current atmospheric pressure if it were to be released. This rate of removal would be sufficient to counter the effects of increasing solar luminosity for the next two billion years.&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt;

By 2.8 billion years from now, the surface temperature of the Earth will have reached {{convert|422|K|C F}}, even at the poles. At this point, any remaining life will be extinguished due to the extreme conditions. If the Earth loses its surface water by this point, the planet will stay in the same conditions until the Sun becomes a red giant.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} If this scenario does not happen, then in about 3–4 billion years the amount of water vapour in the lower atmosphere will rise to 40% and a "moist greenhouse" effect will commence&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt; once the luminosity from the Sun reaches 35–40% more than its present-day value.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt; A "runaway greenhouse" effect will ensue, causing the atmosphere to heat up and raising the surface temperature to around {{convert|1600|K|C F}}. This is sufficient to melt the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} However, most of the atmosphere will be retained until the Sun has entered the red giant stage.&lt;ref name=minard09/&gt;

With the extinction of life, 2.8 billion years from now it is also expected that Earth [[biosignature]]s will disappear, to be replaced by signatures caused by non-biological processes.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

=== Red giant stage ===

[[File:Sun red giant.svg|thumb|240px|right|alt=A large red disk represents the Sun as a red giant. An inset box shows the current Sun as a yellow dot.|The size of the current Sun (now in the [[main sequence]]) compared to its estimated size during its [[red giant]] phase]]
Once the Sun changes from burning hydrogen at its core to burning hydrogen around its shell, the core will start to contract and the outer envelope will expand. The total luminosity will steadily increase over the following billion years until it reaches 2,730 times the Sun's current [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] at the age of 12.167 billion years. Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and its surface will consist of a [[Lava-ocean planet|lava ocean]] with floating continents of metals and metal oxides as well as [[iceberg]]s of [[Refractory|refractory materials]], with its surface temperature reaching more than {{convert|2400|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name="Kargel2003"/&gt; The Sun will experience more rapid mass loss, with about 33% of its total mass shed with the [[solar wind]]. The loss of mass will mean that the orbits of the planets will expand. The orbital distance of the Earth will increase to at most 150% of its current value.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The most rapid part of the Sun's expansion into a red giant will occur during the final stages, when the Sun will be about 12 billion years old. It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus, reaching a maximum radius of {{convert|1.2|AU|km|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The Earth will interact tidally with the Sun's outer atmosphere, which would serve to decrease Earth's orbital radius. Drag from the [[chromosphere]] of the Sun would also reduce the Earth's orbit. These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass loss by the Sun, and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The drag from the solar atmosphere may cause the [[orbit of the Moon]] to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of {{convert|18470|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it will cross the Earth's [[Roche limit]]. This means that tidal interaction with the Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a [[ring system]]. Most of the orbiting ring will then begin to decay, and the debris will impact the Earth. Hence, even if the Earth is not swallowed up by the Sun, the planet may be left moonless.&lt;ref name=space070122/&gt; The [[ablation]] and [[vaporization]] caused by its fall on a decaying trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's mantle, leaving just its core, which will finally be destroyed after at most 200 years.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jianke1998/&gt; Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%) of the solar [[metallicity]].&lt;ref name="RvMP1997"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;§IIC&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Post-red giant stage ===

[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Helix nebula]], a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will produce in 8 billion years.]]

After fusing helium in its core to [[carbon]], the Sun will begin to collapse again, [[stellar evolution|evolving]] into a compact [[white dwarf]] star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a [[planetary nebula]]. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become [[tidelock]]ed, with each showing only one face to the other.&lt;ref name="tide1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract [[angular momentum]] from the system, causing the [[lunar orbit]] to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="canup_righter"&gt;

In about 65 billion years, it is estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the [[Earth–Moon system]] being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2017/01/31/earth-and-moon-may-be-on-long-term-collision-course/#38a21ffa3c68|work=Forbes|author=Bruce Dorminey|title=Earth and Moon May Be on Long-Term Collision Course|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years, then on a time scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; (10 quintillion) years the remaining planets in the Solar System will be ejected from the system by [[violent relaxation]]. If this does not occur to the Earth, the ultimate fate of the planet will be that it collides with the [[black dwarf]] Sun due to the decay of its orbit via [[gravitational radiation]], in 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name="dyson"&gt;

These two climate states last for  millions of years and should not be confused with [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods, which occur only during an icehouse period and tend to last less than 1 million years. There are [[Timeline of glaciation|five known great glaciation]]s in Earth's climate history; the main factors involved in changes of the [[paleoclimate]] are believed to be the concentration of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], changes in the [[Earth's orbit]], and oceanic and [[orogenic]] changes due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate dynamics]]. Greenhouse and icehouse periods have profoundly shaped the [[evolution]] of life on Earth.

==Greenhouse Earth==
===Overview of greenhouse Earth===
A "greenhouse Earth" or "hothouse Earth" is a period in which there are no continental [[glacier]]s whatsoever on the planet, the levels of carbon dioxide and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[water vapor]] and [[methane]]) are high, and [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs) range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[tropics]] to 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Gregory|author2=Paul J. Valdes |author3=Bruce W.

This state should not be confused with a hypothetical ''hothouse earth'', which is an irreversible tipping point corresponding to the ongoing [[runaway greenhouse effect]] on [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steffen | first=Will | last2=Rockström | first2=Johan |authorlink2=Johan Rockström | last3=Richardson | first3=Katherine | last4=Lenton | first4=Timothy M. | last5=Folke | first5=Carl | last6=Liverman | first6=Diana | last7=Summerhayes | first7=Colin P. | last8=Barnosky | first8=Anthony D. | last9=Cornell | first9=Sarah E. | last10=Crucifix | first10=Michel | last11=Donges | first11=Jonathan F. | last12=Fetzer | first12=Ingo | last13=Lade | first13=Steven J. | last14=Scheffer | first14=Marten | last15=Winkelmann | first15=Ricarda | last16=Schellnhuber | first16=Hans Joachim | title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=2018-08-06 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115 | page=201810141 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC]] states that "a 'runaway greenhouse effect'—analogous to [that of] Venus—appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session31/inf3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of greenhouse Earth===
There are several theories as to how a greenhouse Earth can come about.  The geological record shows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases are abundant during this time. [[Tectonic movement]]s were extremely active during the more well-known greenhouse ages (such as 368 million years ago in the [[Paleozoic]] Era). Because of [[Divergent boundary|continental rifting]] ([[continental plate]]s moving away from each other) [[volcanic]] activity becomes more prominent, producing more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and heating up the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=Richard D.|author2=Karen L.

==Icehouse Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{see also|Ice age|Timeline of glaciation}}

===Overview of icehouse Earth===
An "icehouse Earth" is the earth as it experiences an [[ice age]]. Unlike a greenhouse Earth, an icehouse Earth has [[ice sheet]]s present, and these sheets wax and wane throughout times known as [[glacial periods]] and [[interglacial|interglacial period]]s. During an icehouse Earth, greenhouse gases tend to be less abundant, and temperatures tend to be cooler globally. The Earth is currently in an icehouse stage,&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montanez|first=Isabel|author2=G.S. Soreghan|title=Earth's Fickle Climate: Lessons Learned from Deep-Time Ice Ages|journal=Geotimes|date=March 2006|volume=51|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ice sheets are present on both [[Geographical pole|pole]]s and glacial periods have occurred at regular intervals over the past million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monnin |first1=E. |last2=Indermühle |first2=A. |last3=Dällenbach |first3=A. |last4=Flückiger |first4=J. |last5=Stauffer |first5=B. |last6=Stocker |first6=T.

===Causes of icehouse Earth===
The causes of an icehouse state are much debated, because not much is really known about the transition periods between greenhouse to icehouse climates and what could make the climate so different. One important aspect is clearly the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, possibly due to low volcanic activity.

Other important issues are the movement of the tectonic plates and the opening and closing of oceanic gateways.&lt;ref name="Smith-p337-340"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alan G.|author2=Kevin T. Pickering|title=Oceanic gateways as a critical factor to initiate icehouse Earth|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|year=2003|volume=160|pages=337–340|doi=10.1144/0016-764902-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to play a crucial part in icehouse Earths because they can bring forth cool waters from very deep water circulations that could assist in creating ice sheets or thermal isolation of areas. Examples of this occurring are the opening of the [[Oligocene#The opening of the Tasman Gateway|Tasmanian gateway]] 36.5 million years ago that separated [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] and which is believed to have set off the [[Cenozoic]] icehouse,&lt;ref name="Exon-p11-17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exon|first=N.|author2=J. Kennet |author3=M. Malone |title=The Opening of the Tasmanian Gateway Drove Cenozoic Paleoclimate: Results of Leg 189|journal=JOIDES|year=2000|volume=26|pages=11–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the [[Drake Passage]] 32.8 million years ago by the separation of [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latimer|first=J.C.|author2=G.

The revealed fresh [[soil]]s act as [[scrubber]]s of carbon dioxide, which can significantly affect the amount of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. An example of this is the collision between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Asia]]n continent, which created the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Mountains]] about 50 million years ago.

=== Glacials and interglacials ===
{{main|Glacial period|Interglacial}}
Within icehouse states, there are "[[glacial period|glacial]]" and "[[interglacial]]" periods that cause ice sheets to build up or retreat. The causes for these glacial and interglacial periods are mainly variations in the movement of the earth around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broecker|first=Wallace S.|author2=George H. Denton|title=What Drives Glacial Cycles|journal=Scientific American|date=January 1990|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomical components, discovered by the Serbian geophysicist [[Milutin Milanković]] and now known as [[Milankovitch cycles]], include the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth, the [[orbital eccentricity]] (or shape of the [[orbit]]) and the [[precession]] (or wobble) of the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's spin]]. The tilt of the axis tends to fluctuate between 21.5° to 24.5° and back every 41,000 years on the vertical axis. This change actually affects the [[seasonality]] upon the earth, since more or less [[Insolation|solar radiation]] hits certain areas of the planet more often on a higher tilt, while less of a tilt would create a more even set of seasons worldwide. These changes can be seen in ice cores, which also contains information that shows that during glacial times (at the maximum extension of the ice sheets), the atmosphere had lower levels of carbon dioxide. This may be caused by the increase or redistribution of the [[acid]]/[[Base (chemistry)|base]] balance with [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ion]]s that deals with [[alkalinity]]. During an Icehouse, only 20% of the time is spent in interglacial, or warmer times.&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56" /&gt;

=== Snowball earth ===
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
A "[[snowball earth]]" is the complete opposite of greenhouse Earth, in which the earth's surface is completely frozen over; however, a snowball earth technically does not have continental ice sheets like during the icehouse state. "The Great Infra-[[Cambrian]] Ice Age" has been claimed to be the host of such a world, and in 1964, the scientist [[W. Brian Harland]] brought forth his discovery of indications of glaciers in [[low latitudes]] (Harland and Rudwick). This became a problem for Harland because of the thought of the "Runaway Snowball Paradox" (a kind of [[Snowball effect]]) that, once the earth enters the route of becoming a snowball earth, it would never be able to leave that state. However, in 1992 {{ill|Joseph Kirschvink|display=1|de}} brought up a solution to the paradox. It is believed that since the continents at this time were huddled at the low and mid-latitudes that there was a great cooling event by planetary [[albedo]], or reflection of the earth’s surface. Kirschvink explained that the way to get out of the snowball could be connected to carbon dioxide, since volcanic activity would not halt, and that the buildup and lack of "[[scrubber|scrubbing]]" of this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that the earth would return to a greenhouse state. Some scientists believe that the end of the snowball Earth caused an event known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], which produced the beginnings of [[multi-cellular]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maruyama|first=S.|author2=M. Santosh|title=Models on Snowball Earth and Cambrian explosion: A synopsis|journal=Gondwana Research|year=2008|volume=14|pages=22–32|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.01.004|bibcode=2008GondR..14...22M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some biologists claim that a complete snowball Earth could not have happened since [[photosynthetic]] life would not have survived underneath many meters of ice without [[sunlight]]. However, it has been observed that, even under meters of thick ice around Antarctica, sunlight shows through. Most scientists{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} today believe that a "hard" Snowball Earth, one completely covered by ice, is probably impossible. However, a "slushball earth", with points of openings near the [[equator]], is possible.

Recent studies may have again complicated the idea of a snowball earth. In October 2011, a team of French researchers announced that the carbon dioxide during the last speculated "snowball earth" may have been lower than originally stated, which provides a challenge in finding out how Earth was able to get out of its state and if it were a snowball or slushball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNRS|first=Delegation Paris Michel-Ange|title=Snowball Earth's hypothesis challenged|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/000102083450.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=24 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

===Causes===
The [[Eocene]], which occurred between 53 and 49 million years ago, was the Earth's warmest temperature period for 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herath|first=Anuradha K.|title=From Greenhouse to icehouse|url=http://www.astrobio.net./exclusive/3320/from-greenhouse-to-icehouse|work=Astrobio|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "super-greenhouse" eventually became an icehouse by the late Eocene. It was believed that the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused this change, though there are possible [[positive feedback]]s, or added influence that contributes to the cooling.

The best record we have for a transition from an icehouse to a greenhouse period where plant life exists is during the [[Permian]] [[Age (geology)|epoch]] that occurred around 300 million years ago. In 40 million years a major transition took place, causing the Earth to change from a moist, icy planet where [[rainforest]]s covered the tropics, into a hot, dry, and windy location where little could survive. Professor [[Isabel P. Montañez]] of [[University of California, Davis]], who has researched this time period, found the climate to be "highly unstable" and "marked by dips and rises in carbon dioxide".&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of California-Davis|title=A Bumpy Shift from Ice House to Greenhouse|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070104144854.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts===
The Eocene-Oligocene transition, the latest transition occurring approximately 34 million years ago, resulted in rapid global temperature decrease, the glaciation of Antarctica and a series of biotic extinction events. The most dramatic species turnover event associated with this time period is the [[Grande Coupure]], a period which saw the replacement of European tree-dwelling and leaf-eating mammal species by migratory species from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prothero|first=D. R.|date=1994-01-01|title=The Late Eocene-Oligocene Extinctions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=22|issue=1|pages=145–165|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|bibcode=1994AREPS..22..145P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The science of [[paleoclimatology]] attempts to understand the history of greenhouse and icehouse conditions over geological time. Through the study of [[ice core]]s, [[dendrochronology]], [[ocean]] and [[lake]] [[sediment]]s ([[varve]]), [[palynology]] ([[fossil]]ized [[pollen]]) and [[isotope]] analysis (such as [[Radiometric dating]] and stable isotope analysis), scientists can create models of past climate. One study has shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the [[Permian]] age rocked back and forth between 250 [[parts per million]] (which is close to present-day levels) up to 2,000 parts per million.&lt;ref name="UCDavis" /&gt; Studies on lake sediments suggest that the "Hothouse" or "super-Greenhouse" [[Eocene]] was in a "permanent [[El Nino]] state" after the 10&amp;nbsp;°C warming of the deep ocean and high latitude surface temperatures shut down the [[Pacific Ocean]]'s El Nino-[[Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Matthew|author2=Rodrigo Caballero|title=Eocene El Nino: Evidence for Robust Tropical Dynamics in the "Hothouse"|journal=Science|date=7 February 2003|volume=299|pages=877–881|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..877H |doi = 10.1126/science.1078766|pmid=12574626}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory was suggested for the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] on the sudden decrease of carbon isotopic composition of global inorganic carbon pool by 2.5 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John A.|author2=Daniel P. Schrag|title=Beyond Methane: Towards a theory for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2006|volume=245|pages=523–537|bibcode = 2006E&amp;PSL.245..523H |doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis noted for this negative drop of isotopes could be the increase of [[methane hydrate]]s, the trigger for which remains a mystery. This increase of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], which happens to be a potent, but short-lived greenhouse gas, increased the global temperatures by 6&amp;nbsp;°C with the assistance of the less potent carbon dioxide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Modern conditions==
Currently, the Earth is in an icehouse climate state. About 34 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in [[Antarctica]]; the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]] did not start forming until 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Some processes that may have led to our current icehouse may be connected to the development of the Himalayan Mountains and the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between [[South America]] and Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Scientists have been attempting to compare the past transitions between icehouse and greenhouse, and vice versa to understand where our planet is now heading.

Without the human influence on the greenhouse gas concentration, the Earth would be heading toward a [[ice age|glacial]] period. Predicted changes in [[orbital forcing]] suggest that in absence of human-made [[global warming]] the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now&lt;ref name=BergerLoutre&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger A, Loutre MF |title=Climate.

But due to the ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is instead heading toward a greenhouse Earth period.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Permanent ice is actually a rare phenomenon in the history of the Earth, occurring only in coincidence with the icehouse effect, which has affected about 20% of Earth's history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9180">A '''helium mass spectrometer''' is an instrument commonly used to detect and locate small leaks. It was initially developed in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II to find extremely small leaks in the [[Gaseous diffusion|gas diffusion process]] of [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=LEAK DETECTION|author=N. Hilleret|publisher=[[CERN]]|place=[[Geneva, Switzerland]]|quote=At the origin of the helium leak detection method was the ”Manhattan Project” and the unprecedented leak-tightness requirements needed by the uranium enrichment plants. The required sensitivity needed for the leak checking led to the choice of a mass spectrometer designed by Dr. A.O.C. Nier tuned on the helium mass. Because of its industrial use, the material choice (originally glass) turned out to be unbearably fragile and after many complaints by the users, a new metallic version was developed and constructed. The sensitivity of the apparatus was in 1946 ~10{{sup|−7}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} and it increased to ~10{{sup|−10}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} by 1970. Nowadays the quoted sensitivity of the most sensitive detectors is ~10{{sup|−13}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}, a factor 10{{sup|6}} gain within 50 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically uses a [[vacuum chamber]] in which a sealed container filled with helium is placed. Helium leaks out of the container, and the rate of the leak is detected by a [[mass spectrometer]].

== Detection technique ==
Helium is used as a [[Flow tracer|tracer]] because it penetrates small leaks rapidly. Helium has also the property of being non-toxic, [[inert gas|chemically inert]] and present in the atmosphere only in minute quantities (5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]]). Typically a helium leak detector will be used to measure leaks in the range of 10{{sup|−5}} to 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·[[metre|m]]{{sup|3}}·[[second|s]]{{sup|−1}}.

A flow of 10{{sup|−5}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} is slightly less than 1 ml per minute at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP).

A flow of 10{{sup|−13}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} is slightly less than 3 ml per century at STP.

== Types of leaks ==
Typically there are two types of leaks in the detection of helium as a ''[[Flow tracer|tracer]]'' for leak detection: residual leak and virtual leak. A residual leak is a real leak due to an imperfect seal, a puncture, or some other hole in the system. A virtual leak is the semblance of a leak in a vacuum system caused by [[outgassing]] of chemicals trapped or adhered to the interior of a system that is actually sealed. As the gases are released into the chamber, they can create a [[false positive]] indication of a residual leak in the system.

== Uses ==
Helium mass spectrometer leak detectors are used in production line industries such as [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]], automotive parts, [[Beverage can|carbonated beverage containers]] food packages and [[aerosol spray|aerosol]] packaging, as well as in the manufacture of steam products, [[gas bottle]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[tire]] valves, and numerous other products including all [[vacuum]] systems.

== Test methods ==
=== Global helium spray ===
This method requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested will be located in some kind of a tent in which the helium concentration will be raised to 100% helium.

If the part is small the vacuum system included in the leak testing instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.

If the size of the part is too large, an additional vacuum pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.

If leakage is encountered the small and "agile" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered.

=== Local helium spray ===
This method is a small variation from the one above.
It still requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested is sprayed with a localized stream of helium tracer gas.

If the part is small the vacuum system included in the instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.

If the size of the part is too large, an additional pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.

If leakage is encountered the small and "agile" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium spray head will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area.

=== Helium charged vacuum test ===
In this case the part is pressurized (sometime this test is combined with a burst test, i.e. at 40 bar) with helium while sitting in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is connected to a vacuum pumping system and a leak detector. Once the vacuum has reached the mass spectrometer operating pressure, any helium leakage will be measured.
This test method applies to a lot of components that will operate under pressure: airbag canisters, evaporators, condensers, high-voltage SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; filled switchgear.

=== Partial vacuum method (ultra sniffer test) ===
In contrast to the Helium charged sniffer test, the partial vacuum method, the ultra sniffer test gas method (UST-method) uses the partial vacuum effect, so that the gas tightness of test sample can be detected at normal pressure with the same sensitivity as the helium charged vacuum test with helium gas helium. The method has a sensitivity of 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}.
Similar to the classical Helium charged sniffer test the test sample is enclosed in a bag, but in contrast to the classic method, the bag is exposed with a helium-free gas, so that the helium concentration inside the bag can reduced from 5·10{{sup|−7}} to 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}. This sensitivity corresponds to a theoretical gas loss of 1 cm{{sup|3}} in 3000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=UST method |author=Robert Brockmann |publisher=researchgate |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Brockmann/contributions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UST method can be used very economically for the ad hoc testing of test samples. The test system can be set up easily, with normal pneumatic items, such as valves and plastic hoses. For the embedding of the test samples, a simple plastic bag is sufficient. The UST method was also used for the leak testing of component of the [[Fusion power|fusion experiment]] [[Wendelstein 7-X]] in Germany.

=== Bombing test ===
This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed.

First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a "bombing" chamber.

If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device.

Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured.

This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices.

This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down.

=== Helium charged sniffer test ===
In this last case the part is pressurized with helium. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a special device, a sniffer probe, that allows it to sample air (and tracer gas when confronted with a leak) at atmospheric pressure and to bring it into the mass spectrometer.

This mode of operation is frequently used to locate a leak that has been detected by other methods, in order to allow for parts repair. Modern machines can digitally remove the helium two decades below the background level and thus it is now possible detect leaks as small as 5·10{{sup|−10}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} in sniffing mode.

'''Industrial melanism''' is an [[evolution]]ary effect prominent in several [[arthropod]]s, where dark [[pigmentation]] ([[melanism]]) has evolved in an environment affected by [[industrial pollution]], including sulphur dioxide gas and dark soot deposits. Sulphur dioxide kills [[lichen]]s, leaving tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned, while soot darkens bark and other surfaces. Darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their [[camouflage]] matches the polluted background better; they are thus favoured by [[natural selection]].  This change, extensively studied by [[Bernard Kettlewell]], is a popular [[Teaching of evolution|teaching example in Darwinian evolution]], providing [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence for natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Majerus2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majerus |first1=Michael E. N. |authorlink=Michael Majerus |title=Industrial Melanism in the Peppered Moth, ''Biston betularia'': An Excellent Teaching Example of Darwinian Evolution in Action |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=63–74 |doi=10.1007/s12052-008-0107-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kettlewell's results have been challenged by zoologists, creationists and the journalist [[Judith Hooper]], but later researchers have upheld Kettlewell's findings.&lt;ref name=rudge2005/&gt;
 
Industrial melanism is widespread in the [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths), involving over 70 species such as ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]'' (scalloped hazel)&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=L. M. |last2=Turner |first2=J. R. G.|title=Decline of melanism in two British moths: spatial, temporal and inter-specific variation |journal=Heredity |date=2008 |volume=101 |pages=483–489 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.105 |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v101/n6/full/hdy2008105a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lymantria monacha]]'' (dark arches),&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010/&gt; but the most studied is the [[Peppered moth evolution|evolution of the peppered moth]], ''[[Biston betularia]]''. It is also seen in a beetle, ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous [[aposematism|warning coloration]], and in the seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' where the melanism may help in excretion of trace elements through [[sloughing]] of the skin. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution, in effect a [[natural experiment]], makes natural selection for camouflage "the only credible explanation".&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Other explanations for the observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed, including strengthening the immune system in a polluted environment, absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution, and the ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers.

==History==
[[File:Biston betularia 20110529 102239 8073M.JPG|thumb|upright|Intermediate ''insularia'' form (between pale ''typica'' and dark ''carbonaria'' in tone) of peppered moth on a [[lichen]]-covered [[birch]] tree: [[Bernard Kettlewell]] counted the frequencies of all three forms.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955/&gt;]]

Industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by the geneticist [[William Bateson]]; he observed that the colour morphs were inherited, but did not suggest an explanation for the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]].&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateson, William |authorlink=William Bateson |year=1900 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in moths—memorandum from the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society |journal=Entomological Record |volume=12 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the geneticist [[Leonard Doncaster]] described the increase in frequency of the melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in the [[Industrial Revolution|heavily industrialised]] north-west region of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doncaster, Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Doncaster |year=1906 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in Lepidoptera |journal=Entomological Record |volume=18 |pages=165–168, 206–208, 222–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] constructed a [[mathematical model|mathematical argument]] showing that the rapid growth in frequency of the ''carbonaria''  form of the peppered moth, ''Biston betularia'', implied [[natural selection|selective pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J. B. S. |authorlink=J. B. S. Haldane |title=A mathematical theory of natural and artificial selection--I. 1924 |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |year=1990 |volume=52 |issue=1–2 |pages=209–40; discussion 201–207 |pmid=2185859 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(05)80010-2}} Originally published in Trans Camb Phil Soc 23: 19–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Haldane, J. B. S. |authorlink=J. B. S. Haldane |title=The Causes of Evolution |year=1932 |publisher=Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1955 onwards, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] conducted [[Kettlewell's experiment|a series of experiments]] exploring the [[peppered moth evolution|evolution of melanism in the peppered moth]]. He used a [[capture-mark-recapture]] technique to show that dark forms survived better than light ones.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kettlewell |first1=H. B.

By 1973, pollution in England had begun to decrease, and the dark ''carbonaria'' form had declined in frequency. This provided convincing evidence, gathered and analysed by Kettlewell and others such as the entomologist and geneticist [[Michael Majerus]] and the population geneticist Laurence M. Cook, that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to the changing pollution of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kettlewell, H. B.

==Taxonomic range==

Industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of [[moth]] that Kettlewell found in England, and many others from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hendry |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kinnison |first2=Michael T. |title=Microevolution Rate, Pattern, Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E031CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-010-0585-2 |pages=185–}}, which cites Kettlewell 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among these, ''[[Apamea crenata]]'' (clouded border brindle moth) and ''[[Acronicta rumicis]]'' (knot grass moth) are always polymorphic, though the melanic forms are more common in cities and (like those of the peppered moth) are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted.&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Among other insects, industrial melanism has been observed in a [[beetle]], ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'', the two-spot ladybird.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"/&gt;

In the vertebrates, industrial melanism is known from the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt; and may be present in urban [[feral pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatelain |first1=M. |last2=Gasparini |first2=J. |last3=Jacquin |first3=L. |last4=Frantz |first4=A. |title=The adaptive function of melanin-based plumage coloration to trace metals |journal=Biology Letters |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=20140164–20140164 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0164|pmc=3982444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Peppered moth evolution}}

Originally, peppered moths lived where light-colored [[lichen]]s covered the trees. For [[camouflage]] from predators against that clean background, they had generally light coloration.&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, [[sulphur dioxide]] pollution in the atmosphere reduced the lichen cover, while [[soot]] blackened the bark of urban trees, making the light-colored moths more vulnerable to predation. This provided a selective advantage to the gene responsible for melanism, and the darker-colored moths increased in frequency.&lt;ref name="Grant1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Bruce S. |title=Fine Tuning the Peppered Moth Paradigm |journal=Evolution |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1999 |pages=980–984 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb05394.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McIntyre, N.

''typica''), forming a peak of 98% of the population in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clarke |first1=C. A. |last2=Mani |first2=G.

[[File:Lichen-covered tree, Tresco.jpg|thumb|upright|Tree bark covered in shrubby and leafy [[lichen]]s forms a patterned background against which non-melanic [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]] moth [[camouflage]] is effective.]]

Melanic ''B. betularia'' have been widely observed in North America. In 1959, 90% of ''B. betularia'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania were melanic. By 2001, melanism dropped to 6% of the population, following clean air legislation.&lt;ref name=Grant2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B. S.; Wiseman L.

The return of lichens is in turn directly correlated with the reduction in atmospheric sulphur dioxide.&lt;ref name=Brakefield2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brakefield, P. M.; Liebert, T.

===Controversy===

Kettlewell's experiments were criticised by the zoologist Theodore David Sargent, who failed to reproduce Kettlewell's results between 1965 and 1969, and argued that Kettlewell had specially trained his birds to give the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargent |first1=TD |title=Cryptic moths: effects on background selections of painting the circumocular scales |journal=Science |year=1968 |volume=159 |issue=3810 |pages=100–101 |pmid=5634373 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3810.100|bibcode=1968Sci...159..100S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargent |first1=T.

It has been suggested that the demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because the exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin-pointed. However, as air quality has improved in industrial areas of America and Britain, through improved [[regulation]], offering the conditions for a [[natural experiment]], melanism has sharply declined in moths including ''B. betularia'' and ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]''. Cook and J. R. G. Turner have concluded that "natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline",&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt; and other biologists working in the area concur with this judgement.&lt;ref name=Grant1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B.

===Immunity===

In 1921, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] argued that the observed increase in the melanic form of the black arches moth, ''[[Lymantria monacha]]'', could not have been caused by [[mutation pressure]] alone, but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause: he did not consider camouflage as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt |first=R. |authorlink=Richard Goldschmidt |title=Controversial Geneticist and Creative Biologist: A Critical Review of His Contributions with an Introduction by Karl von Frisch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5L5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3-0348-5855-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century later, it was suggested that the moth's industrial melanism might, in addition ([[pleiotropy]]) to providing camouflage with "the well-known protective dark coloration",&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010/&gt; also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution. The darker forms have a stronger [[immune response]] to foreign objects; these are encapsulated by [[haemocyte]]s (insect blood cells), and the capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of the dark pigment, [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Rantala, M. J. |date=2010 |title=Immune defence, a possible nonvisual selective factor behind the industrial melanism of moths (Lepidoptera) |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=831–838 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie andKanost1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillespie |first1=Jeremy P. |last2=Kanost |first2=Michael R. |last3=Trenczek |first3=Tina |title=Biological Mediators of Insect Immunity |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=611–643 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace metal excretion===

A non-camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates. In tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' is more likely to be melanic. These snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks. Sloughed skin contains toxic minerals, higher for dark skin, so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements.{{efn|The article does not address whether this is a genetic mutation or reversible adaptation by individuals.&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Goiran&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goiran, C.; Bustamante, P.; Shine, R. |title=Industrial Melanism in the Seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=16 |pages=2510–2513.e2 |year=2017 |pmid=28803870 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may apply in the case of urban feral pigeons, which have the ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers. However, toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers, so the putative mechanism is limited in its range.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"/&gt;

===Thermal advantage===

 | align   = right
}}

Melanic forms of the two-spot ladybird ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' are very frequent in and near cities, and rare in unpolluted countryside, so they appear to be industrial. Ladybirds are [[aposematic]] (with conspicuous warning coloration), so camouflage cannot explain the distribution. A proposed explanation is that the melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to the pollution aspect of industrialization, since smoke and particulates in the air reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the habitats of these species. Melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection, as the dark coloration absorbs the limited sunlight better.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muggleton |first1=John |last2=Lonsdale |first2=David |last3=Benham |first3=Brian R. |title=Melanism in ''Adalia bipunctata'' L. (Col., Coccinellidae) and its Relationship to Atmospheric Pollution |journal=The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=12 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=451 |doi=10.2307/2402167}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation might be that in colder environments, the thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and the likelihood to mate. In the Netherlands, melanic ''A. bipunctata'' had a distinct mating advantage over the non-melanic form.&lt;ref name="De JongVerhoog1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Jong |first1=Peter W. |last2=Verhoog |first2=Michelle D. |last3=Brakefield |first3=Paul M. |title=Sperm competition and melanic polymorphism in the 2-spot ladybird, ''Adalia bipunctata'' (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)  |journal=Heredity |volume=70 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=172–178 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1993.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt;

However, thermal melanism failed to explain the distribution of the species near [[Helsinki]] where the city forms a relatively warm 'heat island', while near the Finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism, so the selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation.&lt;ref name=Mikkola1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Albrecht, A. |year=1988 |title=The melanism of ''Adalia-bipunctata'' around the Gulf of Finland as an industrial phenomenon (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=25 |pages=77-85 |jstor=23734522}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Birmingham]] similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution; melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as the city became cleaner. Further, the same study found that a related species, ''[[Adalia decempunctata]]'', experienced no change in frequency of melanism in the same places in that period.&lt;ref name="BrakefieldLees1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brakefield |first1=Paul M. |last2=Lees |first2=David R. |title=Melanism in Adalia ladybirds and declining air pollution in Birmingham |journal=Heredity |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1987 |pages=273–277 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1987.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], an '''interface''' is the boundary between two spatial regions occupied by different matter, or by matter in different physical states. The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a '''surface''', and studied in [[surface science]]. In [[thermal equilibrium]], the regions in contact are called [[phase (matter)|phases]], and the interface is called a [[phase boundary]]. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the [[grain boundary]] in polycrystalline matter.

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

==Selection==
The habitats that have been designated to be of "principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity" derive from lists originally drawn up for the [[UK Biodiversity Action Plan|UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP)]]. These lists were reviewed in 2007, and the total number of UK BAP habitats increased from 45 to 65, and the number of UK BAP species increased from under 600 to 1,150.&lt;ref name="UK BAP priority"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK BAP priority species and habitats|url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5705|website=jncc.defra.gov.uk|publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From these, the formal list just for Wales (and laid out below) now contains 53 of those 65 habitats.&lt;ref name="Priority habitat list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7|url=https://www.biodiversitywales.org.uk/File/35/en-GB|publisher=Welsh Government|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal obligations===
Section 6 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 places a legal obligation on public bodies in Wales to 'maintain and enhance biodiversity' whilst carrying out their functions.&lt;ref name="Section 6"/&gt; Section 7 of that Act requires [[Welsh Ministers]] to publish and maintain lists of species and types of habitats in Wales that are regarded as of 'principal importance' for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing that biodiversity. This section of the Act replaces the biodiversity duty originally outlined in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 for both England and Wales.&lt;ref name="EWA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Section 7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity lists and duty to take steps to maintain and enhance biodiversity |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2016/3/section/7/enacted|website=www.legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
Awareness of the presence of any priority habitat or priority species identified on these lists is of importance within the [[Local planning authority|local authority planning process]] when land is considered for development. Along with legally protected species, as well as statutory and non-statutory sites, knowledge of the presence of priority habitats and priority species is required if the impact of future development is to be avoided or mitigated.  Planning Policy Wales indicates that, when determining planning applications, the existence of priority habitats are of greater status than others. By fully considering all these features in the decision-making process, a planning authority will have demonstrated that it has discharged its duty to conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and wildlife|url=http://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/what-we-do/planning/development-and-wildlife|website=www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk|publisher=Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 10: Priority habitats and species and development|url=http://www.thomsonecology.com/teh/Priority-Habitats-and-Species-and-Development|website=www.thomsonecology.com|publisher=Thomson Ecology|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7392">A '''metasystem transition''' is the [[emergence]], through [[evolution]], of a higher [[:wikt:level|level]] of [[organization]] or [[Control theory|control]].

A [[metasystem]] is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as [[molecules]] (as theorized for instance by [[Hypercycle_(chemistry)|hypercycles]]), [[cell (biology)|cells]], or individuals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed [[individual]], capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more [[Complex systems|complex]], more [[intelligent]], and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems. Prime examples are the [[origin of life]], the transition from unicellular to [[multicellular]] organisms, the emergence of [[eusociality]] or [[symbol]]ic [[thought]]. 

The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician [[Valentin Turchin]] in his 1970 book ''The Phenomenon of Science'', and developed among others by [[Francis Heylighen]] in the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project. The related notion of [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]] was proposed by the biologists [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Eörs Szathmáry]], in their 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"&gt;Smith, J. M., &amp; Szathmary, E. (1997). ''The Major Transitions in Evolution''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related idea, that systems ("operators") evolve to become more complex by successive closures encapsulating components in a larger whole, is proposed in "[[the operator theory]]", developed by Gerard Jagers op Akkerhuis.

Turchin has applied the concept of metasystem transition in the domain of computing, via the notion of [[metacompilation]] or supercompilation. A supercompiler is a compiler program that compiles its own code, thus increasing its own efficiency, producing a remarkable speedup in its execution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Evolutionary quanta ==

The following is the classical sequence of metasystem transitions in the history of animal evolution according to Turchin, from the origin of [[animal|animate]] life to [[sapience|sapient]] culture:

#''' Control of Position = [[motility|Motion]]''': the animal or agent develops the ability to control its position in space
# '''Control of Motion = [[sentience|Irritability]]''': the movement of the agent is no longer given, but a reaction to elementary sensations or stimuli
# '''Control of Irritability = [[Reflex]]''': different elementary sensations and their resulting actions are integrated into a coordinated, but still rigid, reflex-like behavior
# '''Control of Reflex = [[Association (psychology)|Association]]''': behavioral routines become flexible or adaptive, through the learning of new associations between experienced stimuli and actions
# '''Control of Association = [[Thought]]''': new routines no longer need to be learned through experience; they can be developed by abstract, symbolic [[reasoning]]
# '''Control of Thought = [[Culture]]''': symbols and concepts are no longer fixed entities; they  adapt through a process of [[cultural evolution]]

[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|340px|Schematic timeline of information and replicators in the biosphere: [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]] in information processing&lt;ref name=" InfoBiosphere2016"/&gt;]]

Many{{who|date=December 2016}} argue that the next human metasystem transition consists of a merger of biological metasystems with technological metasystems, especially information processing technology. Several [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|cumulative major transitions of evolution]] have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including [[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and also [[language]] and [[culture]] as inter-human information processing systems.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E., &amp; Szathmáry, E.

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 112(33), 10104–10111. http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421398112&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. "Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere... Like previous evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks... humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013 "Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds"], Gillings, M.

[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tables of natural history, from [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
'''Natural history''' is a domain of inquiry involving [[organism]]s including [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s in their environment; leaning more towards [[observation]]al than [[experiment]]al methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a '''naturalist''' or '''natural historian'''.

Natural history encompasses [[Scientific method|scientific research]] but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;With ''natural history'' articles more often published today in [[List of science magazines|science magazines]] than in [[scientific journal|academic journals]].([http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history Natural History ''WordNet Search, princeton.edu''].&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic study of any category of [[nature|natural]] objects or organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{Citation |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while it dates from studies in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] and the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|mediaeval Arabic world]], through to European [[Renaissance]] naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a [[cross discipline]] umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., [[geobiology]] has a strong multi-disciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===
The meaning of the English term "natural history" (a [[calque]] of the [[Latin]] ''historia naturalis'') has narrowed progressively with time; while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term "nature" has widened (see also [[#History|History]] below).

In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], "natural history" covered essentially anything connected with [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], or which used materials drawn from nature, such as [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|encyclopedia of this title]], published [[circa]] 77 to 79 AD, which covers [[astronomy]], [[geography]], humans and their [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[superstition]], as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the [[humanities]] (primarily what is now known as [[classics]]) and [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the [[Renaissance]], and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and  [[natural philosophy]], the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], while natural history included the [[biology|biological]] and [[geology|geological]] sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the [[gentleman scientist]]s, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional [[Academy of Sciences|science society]] meetings such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – both founded during the seventeenth century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koerner |first=Lisbet |authorlink=Lisbet Rausing |title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation |year=1999 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-09745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted the development of geology to help find useful [[mineral]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin, "Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture", Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lowe Fleischner, ''The Way of Natural History'', Trinity University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lycee Michelet Vanves bibliotheque collection histoire naturelle.jpg|thumb|left|A natural history collection in a French public secondary school]]
Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: "Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities"&lt;ref&gt;Marston Bates, ''The nature of natural history'', Scribners, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: "The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species".&lt;ref&gt;D. S Wilcove and T. Eisner, "The impending extinction of natural history," Chronicle of Higher Education 15 (2000): B24&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: "Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Greene and J. B. Losos, "Systematics, Natural-History, and Conservation – Field Biologists Must Fight a Public-Image Problem," Bioscience 38 (1988): 458–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environment, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: "A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment".&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Bartholomew, "The Role of Natural History in Contemporary Biology", Bioscience 36 (1986): 324–329&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: "Descriptive ecology and ethology".&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Greene, "Organisms in nature as a central focus for biology", Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20 (2005):23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as "the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships.

It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component",&lt;ref&gt;S. G Herman, "Wildlife biology and natural history: time for a reunion", The Journal of wildlife management 66, no. 4 (2002): 933–946&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as "A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Fleischner, "Natural history and the spiral of offering", Wild Earth 11, no. 3/4 (2002): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the "Patient interrogation of a landscape" while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo ([[Inuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'', Vintage, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading [[natural history museum]]s, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology and astronomy along with botany and zoology,&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History, [http://www.amnh.org/about/ Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145807/http://www.amnh.org/about/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field Museum, [http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103185243/http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or include both cultural and natural components of the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History Museum, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/index.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions have recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declinetorebirth.org/conversations/an-accepted-way-of-viewing-art An Accepted Way of Viewing Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]] from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript]]
Natural history begins with [[Aristotle]] and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by [[Pliny the Elder]] to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art and humanity.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History: A Selection | publisher=Penguin Classics | author=Pliny the Elder | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-14-044413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the [[ancient Greeks]] until the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] and other 18th century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]], an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964&gt;{{citation |date=1964 | origyear=1936 |author=Arthur O. Lovejoy |authorlink=Arthur Oncken Lovejoy |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe – although in the [[Arabic]] and [[Oriental]] world it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the thirteenth century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into [[Christian philosophy]], particularly by [[Thomas Aquinas]], forming the basis for [[natural theology]]. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual [[monster]]s. [[Leonhart Fuchs]] was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] and [[Hieronymus Bock]]. Other important contributors to the field were [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Konrad Gesner]] (''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''), [[Frederik Ruysch]], or [[Gaspard Bauhin]].&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;"[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Natural+History Natural History Timeline]". HistoryofScience.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]], culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref name="natural"/&gt;

===Birth of scientific biology===&lt;!--off topic? Biology isn't NH--&gt;
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his ''[[Histoire naturelle]]'', a 44 volume encyclopedia describing quadrupeds, birds, minerals and some science and technology. Reptiles and fish were covered in supplements by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]].]]&lt;!--not discussed in text, no refs!--&gt;
A significant contribution to English natural history was made by [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]], [[John George Wood]], and [[John Ray]], who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the [[natural theology]] argument for the existence or goodness of God.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Armstrong|title=The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB0hEc4CN3wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Europe]], professional disciplines such as botany, geology, [[mycology]], [[palaeontology]], [[physiology]] and [[zoology]] were formed. ''Natural history'', formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an "amateur" activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland it was believed that the study of natural history contributed to good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |title='An aid to mental health': natural history, alienists and therapeutics in Victorian Scotland| author=Finnegan, Diarmid A. |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=326–337 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.006| pmid=18761284| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the [[Ornithology|study of birds]], butterflies, seashells ([[malacology]]/[[conchology]]), beetles and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth's biosphere that support them), [[ethology]] (the scientific study of animal behavior), and [[evolutionary biology]] (the study of the relationships between life-forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world's large natural history collections, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the nineteenth century, [[Henry Walter Bates]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of "remote" parts of the world—the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and the [[Malay archipelago]], among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory based science.

The understanding of "Nature" as "an organism and not as a mechanism" can be traced to the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt's copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[John Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Wulf]] (2015),''[[The Invention of Nature]]'', Knopf {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
{{further|List of natural history museums}}
Natural history [[museum]]s, which evolved from [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research.

==Societies==
[[File:Szczecin pomnik Jana Czekanowskiego.jpg|thumb|The monument of [[Jan Czekanowski]], a president of [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] (1923–1924), in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]]]
The term "natural history" alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional and local natural history societies that maintain records for [[animal]]s (including [[birds]] (ornithology), [[insect]]s ([[entomology]]) and [[mammal]]s (mammalogy)), [[fungi]] ([[mycology]]), plants (botany) and other organisms. They may also have [[geological]] and [[microscope|microscopical]] sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]] founded in 1829, [[London]] Natural History Society (1858), [[Birmingham Natural History Society]] (1859), [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] founded in 1872, [[Glasgow]] Natural History Society, [[Manchester]] Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists' Club founded in 1913,&lt;ref name="whitbynaturalistsclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbynaturalists.co.uk |title=Whitby Naturalists' Club |publisher=whitbynaturalists.co.uk |accessdate=January 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough Field Naturalists' Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, [[Sheffield]], founded in 1918.&lt;ref name="WMBC-Oldest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older|title=Older Organisations|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=20 November 2010|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|accessdate=11 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040849/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many [[civil servants]] took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in [[UK|Britain]]. (See also: [[Indian natural history]])

Societies in other countries include the [[American Society of Naturalists]] and [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]].

[[File:Raymond Kurzweil, Stanford 2006 (square crop).jpg|thumb|Ray Kurzweil in 2006]]

American author, inventor and [[futurist]] [[Raymond Kurzweil]] has become well known for his predictions about [[artificial intelligence]] and the human species, mainly concerning the [[Technological Singularity]]. He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'' and 2005's ''[[The Singularity is Near]]'' outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots ([[nanobots]]) called [[utility fog|foglets]] and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby [[nanotechnology]] is incorporated into many internal organs.

==Accuracy of predictions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===''The Age of Intelligent Machines''===
Kurzweil's first book, ''[[The Age of Intelligent Machines]]'', was published in 1990. It forecast the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union]] due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication "was a big factor" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Renee Blodgett |url=http://www.weblogtheworld.com/countries/northern-america/ray-kurzweil-on-gorbachev/ |title=Ray Kurzweil on Gorbachev |publisher=We Blog The World |date=April 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players "by the year 2000".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Age of Intelligent Machines|date=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-11121-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997 chess World Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] was defeated by IBM's [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Swift and Slashing, Computer Topples Kasparav|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/nyregion/swift-and-slashing-computer-topples-kasparov.html|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coffman|first=K.G|title=Growth of the Internet|date=2001|publisher=AT&amp;T Labs Research|url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/oft.internet.growth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the publication of ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'', there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2001_Feb/ai_70910777/pg_3 | work=UNESCO Courier | title=Fleeing the dot.com era – decline in Internet usage | first=Sally | last=Wyatt | date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services".{{Cite quote|date=February 2013}} Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===''The Age of Spiritual Machines''===
In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]'', which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled "To Face the Future", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named "2009", "2019", "2029", and "2099". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Kurzweil restated his earlier prediction from ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The [[K-NFB Reader|"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)]] was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KNFB Reader becomes the Property of the Nation's Blind|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm15/bm1506/bm150603.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) [[Nokia N82]] smartphone was available for $1,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNFB Reader Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|archivedate=February 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208144803/http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for [[iOS]] phones was released for $99 in 2014 and [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] for $75 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inclusiveandroid.com/content/award-winning-text-recognition-app-gives-blind-access-print-now-available-android&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Singularity Is Near''===
While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as ''The Age of Intelligent Machines'' and ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'' did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', though longer-term visions abound.

Kurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the ''computational capacities'' to simulate [[protein folding]] will be introduced.  In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond.  The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heidi Ledford |title=Supercomputer sets protein-folding record |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101014/full/news.2010.541.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date = October 2010|accessdate=January 8, 2011 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The biyearly protein structure prediction contest [[CASP]] shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Other sources===
In an October 2002 article published on [http://www.Kurzweilai.net his website], Kurzweil stated that "[[Deep Fritz]]-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 Deep Fritz Draws: Are Humans Getting Smarter, or Are Computers Getting Stupider?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616094405/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0527.html?printable=1 |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/player/deep_fritz.html The chess games of Deep Fritz (Computer)].

===Ray Kurzweil's response===
According to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/01/ray-kurzweil-responds-to-issue-of.html Ray Kurzweil Responds to the Issue of Accuracy of His Predictions], Next Big Future, January 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzweil, Ray (October 2010) [http://www.kurzweilai.net/predictions/download.php How My Predictions Are Faring].

*Most portable computers do not have moving parts or keyboards.
*Though desktop PCs are still common for data storage, individuals primarily use portable devices for their computer-related tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personal worn computers provide monitoring of body functions, automated identity and directions for navigation.
*Many devices offer high-speed network access via wireless technology.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digital products such as books, songs, games, movies and software are typically acquired as files via a wireless network and have no physical object associated with them.&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt;
*Cables are disappearing. Computer peripherals use wireless communication.
*People can talk to their computer to give commands.
*Computer displays built into eyeglasses for augmented reality are used.
*Computers can recognize their owner's face from a picture or video.
*Three-dimensional chips are commonly used.
*Sound producing speakers are being replaced with very small chip-based devices that can place high resolution sound anywhere in three-dimensional space.
*A $1,000 computer can perform a trillion calculations per second.
*Supercomputers have been built that can operate at 20 petaflops (roughly the hardware-equivalent of the human brain according to Kurzweil).
*Consumer-level computers across the world can network together to form decentralized supercomputers, many of which have the computational capacity of the human brain.
*There is increasing interest in massively parallel neural nets, genetic algorithms and other forms of "chaotic" or complexity theory computing.
*Research has been initiated on reverse engineering the brain through both destructive and non-invasive scans.
*Autonomous nano-engineered machines have been demonstrated and include their own computational controls.
*Digital documents routinely display moving images and sounds.
*Artificial voices sound fully human.
*Phones can translate spoken sentences to different languages and read them back aloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780140282023|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Telephone communication is mostly wireless.
*Cell phones display high resolution images. Users can engage in audio-video teleconferences.
*High resolution audio-visual cybersex is common, aided by falling costs of high-speed internet and computer hardware.
*At least 50% of all transactions are conducted over the internet.
*Personal artificial digital assistants are in widespread use. They can understand spoken language, look up answers to questions, set appointments, conduct transactions, tell jokes, and more.
*An increasing share of the population is working from home and while traveling.
*The typical home has over 100 computers in it, many of which are embedded in appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurzweil|first1=Ray|title=The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence|date=1999|publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-14-028202-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Though not yet ubiquitous, many households have one or more robots that perform some type of housekeeping.
*People often play music alongside digital musicians. (In "How My Predictions Are Faring" written in 2010, Kurzweil cited ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and Apple's ''Magic [[GarageBand]] Jam'' as two examples.)
*Audio-visual virtual reality has entered the mass market. Users can digitally tour real locations or play in highly immersive fantasy worlds. Tactile (haptic) VR technology is still primitive however.
*Militaries rely heavily on armed unmanned airborne devices.
*Death rates for cancer and heart disease have continued to fall as a result of improvements in medical technology.
*Telemedicine is common. Devices monitor and relay health-related data of many patients and send that information to doctors remotely. Teleconferencing between doctor and patient is also popular.
*Computers and medical software are capable enough at image and pattern recognition that they are routinely used to help diagnose diseases by analyzing scans of patients.
*Doctors and medical students often train in virtual reality environments, which include haptic feedback and simulated patients.

====2019====
*The computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the [[human brain]] (20 quadrillion calculations per second).
*The summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race.
*Computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.).
*People experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.
*These special glasses and contact lenses can deliver "augmented reality" and "virtual reality" in three different ways. First, they can project "heads-up-displays" (HUDs) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. Second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. Third, the devices could block out the "real" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment.
*People communicate with their computers via two-way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. Furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. Dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being.
*Most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person.
*Most people own more than one PC, though the concept of what a "computer" is has changed considerably: Computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or CPUs contained in a large box connected to a monitor. Instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes.
*Cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared.
*Rotating computer hard drives are no longer used.
*Three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate.
*Massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use.
*Destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. The algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets.
*Pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere.
*Nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. "Nanoengineered machines" begin to be used in manufacturing.
*Thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. The aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly.
*Computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete.
*Most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. In the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. These assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely.
*Students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers.
*All students have access to computers.
*Most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge.
*Blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. Sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities.
*Retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful.
*Deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. Cochlear and other implants are also widely used.
*People with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers.
*Computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. These are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (e.g. Retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk).
*Language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations.
*Effective language technologies (natural language processing, [[speech recognition]], speech synthesis) exist.
*Anyone can wirelessly access the internet with wearable devices such as computerized glasses, contacts, and watches.
*Traditional computers and communication devices such as desktop PCs, laptops, and cell phones still exist, but most of their functions can be performed by wearable gadgets. Examples include reading books, listening to music, watching movies, playing games, and teleconferencing.
*Devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (e.g. tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. "Virtual sex"—in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a "simulated" partner that only exists on a computer—becomes a reality.
*Just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, [[haptic technology]] has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a V.R. booth. It is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. It is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience.
*Worldwide economic growth has continued. There has not been a global economic collapse.
*The vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer.
*Household robots are ubiquitous and reliable.
*Computers do most of the vehicle driving—-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.
*Most roads now have automated driving systems—networks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate.
*Prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. They are also primarily computer-controlled.
*Humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. The depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights.
*Most decisions made by humans involve consultation with machine intelligence. For example, a doctor may seek the advice of a digital assistant. A lawyer might utilize a virtual researcher. Or a shopper may receive recommendations from a software program that has learned his or her shopping habits.
*While a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the Turing Test.
*Human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing.
*Interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface.
*Public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. Personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes.
*The basic needs of the underclass are met. (Not specified if this pertains only to the developed world or to all countries)
*Virtual artists—creative computers capable of making their own art and music—emerge in all fields of the arts.
*Most flying weapons are bird-sized robots. Some are as small as insects.
*Average life expectancy is over 100.
*Computerized watches, clothing, and jewelry can monitor the wearers health continuously. They can detect many types of diseases and offer recommendations for treatment.

====2029====
*A $1,000 personal computer is 1,000 times more powerful than the human brain.
*The vast majority of computation is done by computers and not by human brains.
*Further progress has been made in understanding the secrets of the human brain. Hundreds of distinct sub-regions with specialized functions have been identified. Some of the algorithms that code for development of these regions have been deciphered and incorporated into neural net computers.
*Massively parallel neural nets, which are constructed through reverse-engineering the human brain, are in common use.
*The eyeglasses and headphones that used to deliver virtual reality are now obsolete thanks to computer implants that go into the eyes and ears. The implants are either permanent or removable. They allow direct interface with computers, communications and Internet-based applications. The implants are also capable of recording what the user sees and hears.
*Computer implants designed for direct connection to the brain are also available. They are capable of augmenting natural senses and of enhancing higher brain functions like memory, learning speed and overall intelligence.
*Computers are now capable of learning and creating new knowledge entirely on their own and with no human help. By scanning the enormous content of the Internet, some computers "know" literally every single piece of public information (every scientific discovery, every book and movie, every public statement, etc.) generated by human beings.
*Direct brain implants allow users to enter full-immersion virtual reality—with complete sensory stimulation—without any external equipment. People can have their minds in a totally different place at any moment. This technology is in widespread use.
*Most communication occurs between humans and machines as opposed to human-to-human.
*The manufacturing, agricultural and transportation sectors of the economy are almost entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease are almost nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.
*The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates a real "[[robot rights]]" movement, and there is open, public debate over what sorts of civil rights and legal protections machines should have. The existence of humans with heavy levels of cybernetic augmentation and of larger numbers of other people with less extreme cybernetic implants lead to further arguments over what constitutes a "human being."
*Although computers routinely pass the Turing Test, controversy still persists over whether machines are as intelligent as humans in all areas.
*Artificial Intelligences claim to be conscious and openly petition for recognition of the fact. Most people admit and accept this new truth.
* Reverse engineering of the human brain completed
* Non-biological intelligence combines the subtlety and pattern recognition strength of human intelligence, with the speed, memory, and knowledge sharing of machine intelligence
* Non-biological intelligence will continue to grow exponentially whereas biological intelligence is effectively fixed in its rate of growth

====2049====
*Food is commonly "assembled" by nanomachines. This food is externally indistinguishable from "natural" food, but it can be made more wholesome since production can be controlled at the molecular level. This technology decouples food production from climate conditions and the availability of natural resources.
*The distinction between virtual reality and "real" reality becomes confounded as [[Utility fog|foglets]] come into common use, allowing immediate assembly or disassembly of all sorts of physical objects.

====2072====
*[[Picoengineering]] (technology on the scale of trillionths of a meter) becomes practical.

====2099====
*The human brain has been completely reverse engineered and all aspects of its functioning are understood.
*Natural human thinking possesses no advantages over computer minds.
*Machines have attained equal legal status with humans.
*Humans and machines merge in the physical and mental realms. Cybernetic brain implants enable humans to fuse their minds with AI's.
*In consequence, clear distinctions between humans and machines no longer exist.
*Most conscious beings lack a permanent physical form.
*The vast majority of the Earth's sentient beings are AI's that exist entirely as thinking computer programs capable of instantly moving from one computer to another across the Internet (or whatever equivalent exists in 2099). These computer-based beings are capable of manifesting themselves at will in the physical world by creating or taking over robotic bodies, with individual AI's also being capable of controlling multiple bodies at once.
*Individual beings merge and separate constantly, making it impossible to determine how many “people” there are on Earth.
*This new plasticity of consciousness and ability for beings to join minds seriously alters the nature of self-identity.
*The majority of interpersonal interactions occur in virtual environments. Actually having two people physically meet in the real world to have a conversation or transact business without any technological interference is very rare.
*Organic human beings are a small minority of the intelligent life forms on Earth. Even among the remaining ''Homo sapiens'', the use of computerized implants that heavily augment normal abilities is ubiquitous and accepted as normal. The small fraction of humans who opt to remain "natural" and unmodified effectively exist on a lower and more limited plane of consciousness from everyone else, and thus find it impossible to fully interact with AI's and highly modified humans.
*"Natural" humans are protected from extermination. In spite of their shortcomings and frailties, humans are respected by AI's for giving rise to the machines.
*Since knowledge and skills can be instantly downloaded and comprehended by most intelligent beings, the process of learning is compressed into an instantaneous affair instead of the years-long struggle normal humans experience. Free from this time-consuming burden, AI's now focus their energies on making new discoveries and contributions.
*AI's are capable of dividing their attention and energies in countless directions, allowing one being to manage a multitude of endeavors simultaneously.
*Femtoengineering (engineering on the scale of one thousandth of a trillionth of a meter) might be possible.
*AI's communicate via a shared electronic language.
*Artwork and music created by machines encompasses areas of the light spectrum and frequencies of sounds that normal humans cannot perceive.
*Money has deflated in value, meaning all sorts of goods and services have become cheaper.
*Some humans at least as old as the Baby Boomers are still alive and well.
*Computer viruses are a major threat since most intelligent beings are software-based.
*AI's frequently make "backup copies" of themselves, guaranteeing a sort of immortality should the original AI be killed.
*The concept of "life expectancy" has become irrelevant to humans and machines thanks to medical immortality and advanced computers.
*The pace of technological change continues to accelerate as the 22nd century nears.

====Thousands of years from now====
*"Intelligent beings consider the fate of all the Universe."

===''The Singularity is Near'' (2005)===
{{Page numbers needed|section|date=July 2016}}

====2010====
*Supercomputers will have the same raw computing power as human brains, though the software to emulate human thinking on those computers does not yet exist. ([[IBM Sequoia]])
*Computers will start to disappear as distinct physical objects, meaning many will have nontraditional shapes or will be embedded in clothing and everyday objects.
*Full-immersion audio-visual virtual reality will exist.

====2015====
*By now, it is likely that "clean a house" will be within the capabilities of a household robot.

====2018====
*10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; bits (=10 TB) of computer memory—roughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain—will cost $1000.
10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.

====2010s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Two", the revolution in Genetics/Biotechnology, is to reach its peak. During the 2020s, humans will have the means of changing their genes; not just "designer babies" will be feasible, but designer baby boomers through the rejuvenation of all of one's body's tissues and organs by transforming one's skin cells into youthful versions of every other cell type. People will be able to "reprogram" their own biochemistry away from disease and aging, radically extending life expectancy.
*Computers become smaller and increasingly integrated into everyday life.
*More and more computer devices will be used as miniature web servers, and more will have their resources pooled for computation.
*High-quality broadband Internet access will become available almost everywhere.
*Eyeglasses that beam images onto the users' retinas to produce virtual reality will be developed. They will also come with speakers or headphone attachments that will complete the experience with sounds.  These eyeglasses will become a new medium for [[advertising]] which will be wirelessly transmitted to them as one walks by various business establishments. This was fictionalized in [[Dennō Coil]].
*The VR glasses will also have built-in computers featuring "virtual assistant" programs that can help the user with various daily tasks. 
*Virtual assistants would be capable of multiple functions. One useful function would be real-time language translation in which words spoken in a foreign language would be translated into text that would appear as subtitles to a user wearing the glasses. 
*Cell phones will be built into clothing and will be able to project sounds directly into the ears of their users. 
*Advertisements will utilize a new technology whereby two ultrasonic beams can be targeted to intersect at a specific point, delivering a localized sound message that only a single person can hear.

====2020s====
* The decade in which "Bridge Three", the revolution in Nanotechnology, is to begin: allowing humans to vastly overcome the inherent limitations of biology, as no matter how much humanity fine-tunes its biology, they will never be as capable otherwise. This decade also marks the revolution in Robotics ([[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI]]), as an AI is expected to pass the [[Turing test]] by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning it can pass for a human being (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of an average, educated human). What follows then will be an era of consolidation in which nonbiological intelligence will undergo exponential growth (Runaway AI), eventually leading to the extraordinary expansion contemplated by the Singularity, in which human intelligence is multiplied by billions by the mid-2040s.
*Early in this decade, humanity will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence within a $1000 personal computer, followed shortly by effective software models of human intelligence toward the middle of the decade: this will be enabled through the continuing exponential growth of brain-scanning technology, which is doubling in bandwidth, temporal and spatial resolution every year, and will be greatly amplified with nanotechnology, allowing us to have a detailed understanding of all the regions of the human brain and to aid in developing human-level machine intelligence by the end of this decade.
*Computers less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm in size will be possible.
*As one of their first practical applications, [[nanomachines]] are used for medical purposes.
*Highly advanced medical [[nanobots]] will perform detailed [[Neuroimaging|brainscans]] on live patients.
*Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood.
*Nanobots capable of entering the bloodstream to "feed" cells and extract waste will exist (though not necessarily be in wide use) by the end of this decade. They will make the normal mode of human food consumption obsolete.
*By the late 2020s, nanotech-based manufacturing will be in widespread use, radically altering the economy as all sorts of products can suddenly be produced for a fraction of their traditional-manufacture costs. The true cost of any product is now the amount it takes to download the design schematics.
*By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality.
*The threat posed by genetically engineered [[pathogens]] permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots—infinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism—become sufficiently advanced.
*The many variations of "Human Body 2.0" (as Kurzweil calls it) are incrementally accumulated into this and the following decade, with each organ and body system having its own course of refinement and development. It ultimately consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation, obsolescing many internal organs, brain-extension and an improved skeleton.

====2023====
*10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; calculations per second—roughly the equivalent of one human brain—will cost $1,000.

====2025====
*The most likely year for the debut of advanced nanotechnology.
*Some military [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s and land vehicles will be 100% computer-controlled.

====2030s====
*[[Mind uploading]] becomes successful and perfected by the end of this decade as humans become software-based: living out on the Web, projecting bodies whenever they want or need (whether in virtual or real reality), and living indefinitely so long as they maintain their "mind file". Eventually, all human beings (including those with [[transbiological]] 2.0 or 3.0 bodies) will migrate to this [[postbiological]] state except for those who wish to remain unenhanced: the transbiological era giving way to the postbiological era.
*Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. [[Afferent nerve fiber|Afferent nerve]] pathways could be blocked, totally cancelling out the "real" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience.
*Brain nanobots could also elicit emotional responses from users.
*Using brain nanobots, recorded or real-time brain transmissions of a person's daily life known as "experience beamers" will be available for other people to remotely experience. This is very similar to how the characters in ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' were able to enter the mind of Malkovich and see the world through his eyes.
*Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to "telepathically" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks.
*The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality.
*The many variations of "Human Body 3.0" are gradually implemented during this and the following decade; It most likely lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology.

====2040s====
*People spend most of their time in full-immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited ''[[The Matrix]]'' as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist).
*[[Utility fog|Foglet]]s are in use.
*Nonbiological intelligence will be billions of times more capable than biological intelligence.

====2045: The Singularity====
*$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans.
*The [[technological singularity]] occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a "runaway reaction" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted (hence the term "Singularity").
*The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans.

====Post-2045: "Waking up" the Universe====
*The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as [[memristors]] integrated into [[Crossbar latch]]es) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size.
*Because of this, A.I.s convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer, except for a few [[nature reserves]] set aside on the planetary surface for those humans who decided to remain in their natural state. "MOSH's" (Mostly Original Substrate Human) who choose to remain purely organic would still possess virtual assistants that will act as their transcendent servants, living in the blurred real world ("foglet-reality") and being provided with environments and everything they could possibly need as they live out the rest of their normal lives unless they enhance themselves.
*At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter and energy in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate outward from Earth, first into the [[Solar System]] and then out into [[interstellar space]], then galaxies in all directions, utilizing [[starship]]s that are [[Von Neumann probes]] with nanobot crews, breaking down whole planets, stars, moons, and meteoroids and reassembling them into computers. This, in effect, "wakes up" the universe as all the inanimate "dumb" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life).
*Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make [[Jupiter Brain|planet-sized computers]] by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity.
*The process of "waking up" the universe could be completed well before the end of the 22nd century, provided humans are not limited by the speed of light.
*With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of "life") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. It is unknown what events will happen in a post cosmic computer mind era, but whatever it is, it will truly be incomprehensible in every sense of the word to feeble human minds. Perhaps an infinite unification of infinite saturated universes, multiverses, and omniverses, an endless vast collection of united cosmic computers possibly.
====Some indeterminate points within a few decades from now====
*Space technology becomes advanced enough to provide the Earth permanent protection from the threat of asteroid impacts.
*The antitechnology [[Luddite]] movement will grow increasingly vocal and possibly resort to violence as these people become enraged over the emergence of new technologies that threaten traditional attitudes regarding the nature of human life (radical life extension, genetic engineering, cybernetics) and the supremacy of mankind (artificial intelligence). Though the Luddites might, at best, succeed in delaying the Singularity, the march of technology is irresistible and they will inevitably fail in keeping the world frozen at a fixed level of development.
*The emergence of distributed energy grids and full-immersion virtual reality will, when combined with high bandwidth Internet, enable the ultimate in [[telecommuting]]. This, in turn, will make cities obsolete since workers will no longer need to be located near their workplaces. The decentralization of the population will make societies less vulnerable to terrorist and military attacks.

Kurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that "nanotechnology-based" flying cars would be available in 20 years.&lt;ref name=booktv&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?194500-1/depth-ray-kurzweil |title=In Depth with Ray Kurzweil |publisher=[[Book TV]] |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a "tipping point" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030&lt;ref&gt;Human 2.0. By: Kurzweil, Ray, New Scientist, 02624079, September 24, 2005, Vol. 187, Issue 2518&lt;/ref&gt; (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.

Kurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/04/12/virtual-reality-will-come-from-inside-our-brain-not-goggles-says-ray-kurzweil/|title=Virtual reality via nanobot injection?

Kurzweil said the following in a November 2007 ''Computerworld'' interview:
*Speech-to-speech translation features will be available in cell phones in either 2009 or 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Lamont, Ian.

*By the same year, practical virtual reality glasses will be in use. The devices will work by beaming images directly onto the retinas of their users, creating large, three-dimensional floating images in the person's field of view. Such devices would provide a visual experience on par with a very large television, but would be highly portable, combining the best features of a [[Portable media player|portable video player]] and a widescreen TV. The glasses will deliver full-immersion virtual reality.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
*By 2017, "augmented reality" will exist: The V.R. glasses previously mentioned will have advanced computers and sensors built into them that will be able to recognize elements within the user's environment and then provide appropriate information and assistance through visual or auditory means. If the user looks at a building or a person's face, the computer will provide information through a "heads-up-display" beamed onto the person's retinas. The devices could also be used for keeping track of schedules, navigating, and querying for general information.&lt;ref name=thegrill/&gt;
* "By 2019, we will largely overcome the major diseases that kill 95 percent of us in the developed world, and we will be dramatically slowing and reversing the dozen or so processes that underlie aging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|title=Ray Kurzweil's Future|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/08/09/ray_kurzweils_future|website=In The Pipeline|publisher=Science|accessdate=November 21, 2015|authorlink=Derek Lowe (chemist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By 2022, medical technology will be more than a thousand times more advanced than it is today, and the "tipping point" of human life expectancy will have been reached, with every new year of research guaranteeing at least one more year of life expectancy. Kurzweil also states that 3–4 months of life expectancy were added in 2007 due to the development of new medicines and treatments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;
*Cell phones and PCs will be increasingly woven into a global grid of computers wirelessly connected to the Internet. Instead of each device just sending and receiving its own data, more and more of the machines will be tasked with processing foreign data, creating a huge, interconnected network with millions of nodes.
*By 2027, accurate computer simulations of all parts of the human brain will exist.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] criticized Kurzweil's predictions: "On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Rennie |author-link=John Rennie (editor) |title=Ray Kurzweil's slippery futurism |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date = December 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Estructura-suelo.jpg|thumb|right|alt=This is a diagram and related photograph of soil layers from bedrock to soil.|A, B, and C represent the soil profile, a notation firstly coined by [[Vasily Dokuchaev]], the father of [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]]; A is the [[topsoil]]; B is a [[regolith]]; C is a [[saprolite]], a less-weathered regolith; the bottom-most layer represents the [[bedrock]].]]
[[File:Stagnogley.JPG|thumb|Surface-water-[[Gley soil|gley]] developed in [[glacial till]], [[Northern Ireland]].]]

'''Soil''' is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support [[life]]. [[Earth]]'s body of soil is the [[pedosphere]], which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of [[water storage]], supply and purification; it is a modifier of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil.

The pedosphere interfaces with the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesworth |first=Ward |date=2008 |title=Encyclopedia of soil science |isbn=978-1402039942 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |nopp=true |url=http://data.lib.hutech.edu.vn/mucluc/f2e0a00788a82be82718e64d734d1a50.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pedolith'', used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ''ground stone''. Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a [[Porosity|porous]] phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voroney |first1=R.

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] which consists of two or more layers, referred to as [[soil horizon]]s, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.&lt;ref name="Buol"/&gt; The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[Soil#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}}

The [[soil texture]] is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] processes causes those particles to [[flocculate]] (stick together) to form [[soil structure|aggregates]] or [[ped]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronick |first1=Carol J. |last2=Lal |first2=Ratan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil structure and management: a review |journal=Geoderma |date=January 2005 |volume=124 |issue=1/2 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.005 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/soil_structure.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Geode.124....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, [[porosity]], [[consistency]], reaction ([[acidity]]), etc.

Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |website=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil [[pore space]] is called the soil solution. Since [[soil water]] is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of minerals from the [[soil profile]]. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Christian |last2=d'Herbès |first2=Jean-Marc |last3=Poesen |first3=Jean |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=37 |issue=1 |title=Soil and water components of banded vegetation patterns |year=1999 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248379223 |pages=1‒24 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00053-3 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/SSAC121/lec14.pdf |title=Soil colloids: properties, nature, types and significance |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soilminerals.com/Cation_Exchange_Simplified.htm |title=Cation exchange capacity in soils, simplified |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrient availability is affected by [[soil pH]], which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18519/FS-1054%20Soil%20pH%20and%20Nutrient%20Availbility.pdf |last=Miller |first=Jarrod O. |title=Soil pH affects nutrient availability |website=[[University of Maryland]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the [[mineral]]s that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulding |first1=Keith W.T. |last2=Bailey |first2=Neal J. |last3=Bradbury |first3=Nicola J. |last4=Hargreaves |first4=Patrick |last5=Howe |first5=MT |last6=Murphy |first6=Daniel V. |last7=Poulton |first7=Paul R. |last8=Willison |first8=Toby W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=139 |issue=1 |title=Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes |year=1998 |pages=49‒58 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues ([[soil organic matter]]), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living [[Soil microbe|microorganisms]] and [[soil organic matter]] are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kononova |first=M.

==History of studies==

===Fertility===
The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for our animals. Throughout history, civilizations have prospered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of their soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillel |first=Daniel |date=1993 |title=Out of the Earth: civilization and the life of the soil |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520080805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: "But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung."{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}

[[Columella]]'s "Husbandry," circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]] ([[green manure]]) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the [[Roman Empire]] until its collapse.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=1}} From the [[fall of Rome]] to the [[French Revolution]], knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low. During the European [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], [[Ibn al-'Awwam|Yahya Ibn al-'Awwam]]'s handbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=[[Ibn al-'Awwam]] |date=1864 |title=Le livre de l'agriculture, traduit de l'arabe par Jean Jacques Clément-Mullet |publisher=Librairie A.

Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Ploeg |first1=Rienk R. |last2=Schweigert |first2=Peter |last3=Bachmann |first3=Joerg |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Scientific World Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=S2 |title=Use and misuse of nitrogen in agriculture: the German story |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/683180/abs/ |year=2001 |pages=737–44 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.263 |pmid=12805882 |pmc=6084271 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1635, the Flemish chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=3}} [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0023133404}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of [[soil fertility]]. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]]'s willow tree derived from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1-5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the "[[superphosphate]]", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.

In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the power of soils to absorb manure |year=1852 |volume=13 |pages=123–43 |url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/45583402 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty years later [[Robert Warington]] proved that this transformation was done by living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warington |first=Robert |title=Note on the appearance of nitrous acid during the evaporation of water: a report of experiments made in the Rothamsted laboratory |year=1878 |publisher=[[Harrison and Sons]] |location=London, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 [[Sergei Winogradsky]] announced he had found the bacteria responsible for this transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=Winogradsky |first=Sergei |journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l'Académie des Sciences]] |title=Sur les organismes de la nitrification |year=1890 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=1013–16 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30663/f1087 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

[[Crop rotation]], mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Formation===
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of [[Life|biotic]] and abiotic (not associated with life) processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, others began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] studied the relationship among rock material, climate, and vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered soil types classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1921 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/65783 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka|Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ge |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis F. Marbut]] was influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as he was placed in charge of the U. S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;

==Formation==
Soil formation, or [[pedogenesis]], is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and [[colloid]]s are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive [[soil horizons]]. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those [[regolith]]s that formed on Mars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Janice L. |last2=Murchie |first2=Scott L. |last3=Pieters |first3=Carlé L. |last4=Zent |first4=Aaron P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002 |title=A model for formation of dust, soil, and rock coatings on Mars: physical and chemical processes on the Martian surface |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=E11 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1029/2001JE001581 |bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5097B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro-González |first1=Rafael |last2=Rainey |first2=Fred A. |last3=Molina |first3=Paola |last4=Bagaley |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Hollen |first5=Becky J. |last6=de la Rosa |first6=José |last7=Small |first7=Alanna M. |last8=Quinn |first8=Richard C. |last9=Grunthaner |first9=Frank J. |last10=Cáceres |first10=Luis |last11=Gomez-Silva |first11=Benito |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2003 |title=Mars-like soils in the Atacama desert, Chile, and the dry limit of microbial life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–21 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |pmid=14605363 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9020258 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[lichens]] and [[cyanobacteria]] then [[epilithic]] [[higher plants]]) become established very quickly on [[basalt]]ic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with [[nutrient]]-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-[[weathering]] [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]]&lt;ref name="Van Schöll2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Schöll |first1=Laura |last2=Smits |first2=Mark M. |last3=Hoffland |first3=Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Ectomycorrhizal weathering of the soil minerals muscovite and hornblende |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=805–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01790.x |pmid=16918551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time.

===Factors===

How soil formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time.&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenny |first=Hans |title=Factors of soil formation: a system of qunatitative pedology |year=1941 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |url=http://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/sykc/hjx/content/ckzl/6/2.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reordered to climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CROPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html |title=The physical environment: an introduction to physical geography |first=Michael E. |last=Ritter |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parent material====
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called [[parent material]]. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20–21}}
* [[Quartz]]: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Calcite]]: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Lössacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.
* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60–90 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

=====Weathering=====
The [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

* '''Physical disintegration''' is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28–31}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839–41 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saprolite]] is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called [weathered granite], saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: [[hydrolysis]], [[chelation]] from organic compounds, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include [[freezing]] and [[thawing]]. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary [[bedrock]] material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called ''arenization'', resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ([[micas]],  [[amphiboles]], [[feldspars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sequeira Braga |first1=Maria Amália |last2=Paquet |first2=Hélène |last3=Begonha |first3=Arlindo |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Weathering of granites in a temperate climate (NW Portugal): granitic saprolites and arenization |journal=Catena |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://home.uevora.pt/~lopes/Artigos/23.PDF |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00017-6 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective [[precipitation]] (i.e., precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]]) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]]: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Howard E. |last2=Burke |first2=Ingrid C. |last3=Lauenroth |first3=William K. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regional patterns of decomposition and primary production rates in the U.S. Great Plains |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=320–27 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233379719 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0320:RPODAP]2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is the dominant factor in [[soil formation]], and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the [[climate zone]]s in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of [[weathering]], [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and plant growth will be maximized.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the [[regolith]]. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site [[topography]], and [[soil permeability]] interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development.

====Topography====
The [[topography]], or [[relief]], is characterized by the inclination ([[slope]]), [[elevation]], and orientation of the terrain. Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L.

In [[swales]] and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s. Intermediate topography affords the best conditions for the formation of an agriculturally productive soil.

Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily [[quartz]] particles, ranging in size from {{convert|2.0|to|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Silt ranges in size from {{convert|0.05|to|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are {{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}} or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 [[angstroms]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m).{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Flemming|1957|p=331}} In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called [[eluviation]]) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called [[illuviation]]). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be [[calcareous]] as well as [[siliceous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/calcsand.html |title=Calcareous Sand |website=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while textural clay ({{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grim |first=Ralph E. |date=1953 |title=Clay mineralogy |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, NY |url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2037422/1/1334.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their [[specific surface area]] (e.g. [[moisture retention]]) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. [[cation exchange capacity]]).

Soil components larger than {{convert|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} are classed as rock and gravel and are removed before determining the percentages of the remaining components and the textural class of the soil, but are included in the name. For example, a sandy [[loam]] soil with 20% gravel would be called gravelly sandy loam.

When the organic component of a soil is substantial, the soil is called organic soil rather than mineral soil. A soil is called organic if:

# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
# Mineral fraction is 0% to 50% clay and organic matter is between 20% and 30%
# Mineral fraction is 50% or more clay and organic matter 30% or more.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=53}}

The clumping of the soil textural components of sand, silt and clay causes [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] to form and the further association of those aggregates into larger units creates [[soil structure]]s called peds (a contraction of the word [[pedolith]]).

Soil structure often gives clues to its texture, organic matter content, biological activity, past soil evolution, human use, and the chemical and mineralogical conditions under which the soil formed. While texture is defined by the mineral component of a soil and is an innate property of the soil that does not change with agricultural activities, soil structure can be improved or destroyed by the choice and timing of farming practices.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"/&gt;

Soil structural classes:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=55–56}}

# Types: '''Shape''' and arrangement of peds
## Platy: Peds are flattened one atop the other 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Found in the A-horizon of forest soils and lake sedimentation.
## Prismatic and Columnar: Prismlike peds are long in the vertical dimension, 10–100&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5–50&amp;nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.
# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type
## Very fine or very thin: &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm platy and spherical; &lt;5&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Fine or thin: 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Medium: 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 20–50 prismlike.
## Coarse or thick: 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 50–100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Very coarse or very thick: &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; &gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.
## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.
## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.

At the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink–swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishné |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

===Consistency===
Consistency is the ability of soil to stick to itself or to other objects ([[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and [[adhesion]], respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boekel |first1=P. |last2=Peerlkamp |first2=Petrus K. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |title=Soil consistency as a factor determining the soil structure of clay soils |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/211680 |year=1956 |pages=122–25 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the engineering of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Robert W. |date=2000 |chapter=Soil mechanics and foundations |title=Building design and construction handbook |edition=6th |editor1-first=Frederick S. |editor1-last=Merritt |editor2-first=Jonathan T. |editor2-last=Rickett |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0070419995 |url=http://my.fit.edu/~locurcio/14-Civil%20&amp;%20Const%20handbooks/McGraw%20Hill%20-%20Design%20&amp;%20Const%20Handbook/06-Soils%20&amp;%20Foundations.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6706e/x6706e08.htm |title=Soil consistency |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.

The terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:

# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm
# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic
# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62–63, 565–67}}

Soil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.

Soil [[heat flux]] refers to the rate at which [[heat energy]] moves through the soil in response to a temperature difference between two points in the soil. The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:

: &lt;math&gt;q_x  = - k \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units
: &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
: &lt;math&gt;\delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.

Heat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.

===Color===
{{Main|Soil color}}
Soil colour is often the first impression one has when viewing soil. Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma. The [[Yellow River]] in China carries yellow sediment from eroding loess soils. [[Mollisols]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America are darkened and enriched by organic matter. [[Podsol]]s in [[Taiga|boreal forests]] have highly contrasting layers due to acidity and leaching.

In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation. Soil color, while easily discerned, has little use in predicting soil characteristics.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=71}} It is of use in distinguishing boundaries of [[Soil horizon|horizons]] within a soil profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sss/2014/03/30/soil-color-never-lies/ |publisher=[[European Geosciences Union]] |title=Soil color never lies |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining the origin of a soil's [[parent material]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viscarra Rossel |first1=Raphael A. |last2=Cattle |first2=Stephen R. |last3=Ortega |first3=A. |last4=Fouad |first4=Youssef |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geoderma |volume=150 |title=In situ measurements of soil colour, mineral composition and clay content by vis–NIR spectroscopy |year=2009 |pages=253–66 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of wetness and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] conditions,&lt;ref name="Blavet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blavet |first1=Didier |last2=Mathe |first2=E. |last3=Leprun |first3=Jean-Claude |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=39 |issue=3 |title=Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_55-56/010021572.pdf |year=2000 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a qualitative means of measuring organic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=J.

The rate at which a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores ([[macropores]]) first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the remaining water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores ([[micropores]]). The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away. Consequently, not all soil water is available to plants, with a strong dependence on [[Soil texture|texture]].&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/75545/BSE-194.pdf |last1=Easton |first1=Zachary M. |last2=Bock |first2=Emily |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil and soil water relationships |website=[[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When saturated, the soil may lose nutrients as the water drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sims |first1=J.

===Water retention forces===
{{Further|Soil water (retention)|Water retention curve}}
Water is retained in a soil when the [[adhesive force]] of attraction that water's [[hydrogen]] atoms have for the [[oxygen]] of soil particles is stronger than the cohesive forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–74}} When a field is flooded, the soil [[pore space]] is completely filled by water. The field will drain under the force of gravity until it reaches what is called [[field capacity]], at which point the smallest pores are filled with water and the largest with water and gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of water held when field capacity is reached is a function of the [[specific surface area]] of the soil particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Møldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole H. |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, high clay and high organic soils have higher field capacities.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Satish C. |last2=Larson |first2=William E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Water Resources Research]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |title=Estimating soil water retention characteristics from particle size distribution, organic matter percent, and bulk density |year=1979 |pages=1633–5 |doi=10.1029/WR015i006p01633 |bibcode=1979WRR....15.1633G |citeseerx=10.1.1.475.497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed [[suction]] and usually expressed in units of bars (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure. Alternatively, the terms "soil moisture tension" or [[water potential]] may be used.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–75}}

===Moisture classification===
The forces with which water is held in soils determine its availability to plants. Forces of [[adhesion]] hold water strongly to mineral and humus surfaces and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles produce increasingly higher [[suction]], finally up to 15&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=Michael J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Joe T. |last3=Bland |first3=William L. |last4=Dugas |first4=William A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agronomy Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |title=Lower limit of soil water availability |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309079210 |year=1996 |pages=644–51 |doi=10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800040024x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called [[wilting point]]. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration, the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts, although [[stoma]]tal closure may decrease transpiration and thus may retard wilting below the [[wilting point]], in particular under [[adaptation]] or [[acclimatization]] to drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Ani |first1=Tariq |last2=Bierhuizen |first2=Johan Frederik |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica |volume=20 |issue=3 |title=Stomatal resistance, transpiration, and relative water content as influenced by soil moisture stress |url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&amp;docid=539770 |year=1971 |pages=318–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1971.tb00715.x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=75–76}}

===Soil moisture content===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensor|Moisture content}}
When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth, the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type. Sandy soil will retain very little water, while clay will hold the maximum amount.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"/&gt; The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay [[loam]] that begins at 43% water by weight to a field capacity of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11% water. The available water for the clay loam might be 11% whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8% by weight.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=76–77}}

The above are average values for the soil textures as the percentages of sand, silt and clay vary.

===Water flow===
Water moves through soil due to the force of [[gravity]], [[osmosis]] and [[capillarity]]. At zero to one-third bar [[suction]], water is pushed through soil from the point of its application under the force of gravity and the pressure gradient created by the pressure of the water; this is called saturated flow. At higher suction, water movement is pulled by capillarity from wetter toward drier soil. This is caused by water's [[adhesion]] to soil solids, and is called unsaturated flow.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/AGRO103/lec03.pdf |title=Soil water movement: saturated and unsaturated flow and vapour movement, soil moisture constants and their importance in irrigation |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water infiltration and movement in soil is controlled by six factors:

# Soil texture
# Soil structure. Fine-textured soils with granular structure are most favourable to infiltration of water.
# The amount of organic matter. Coarse matter is best and if on the surface helps prevent the destruction of soil structure and the creation of crusts.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
# The amount of water already in the soil
# Soil temperature. Warm soils take in water faster while frozen soils may not be able to absorb depending on the type of freezing.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=86}}

Water infiltration rates range from {{convert|0.25|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for high clay soils to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for sand and well stabilised and aggregated soil structures.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=88}} Water flows through the ground unevenly, in the form of so-called "gravity fingers", because of the [[surface tension]] between water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueto-Felgueroso |first1=Luis |last2=Juanes |first2=Ruben |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=24 |title=Nonlocal interface dynamics and pattern formation in gravity-driven unsaturated flow through porous media |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bcee/6f04cc7a8bc8df98d0cb48410ccb1efb6a33.pdf |year=2008 |pages=244504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.244504 |pmid=19113626 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101x4504C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/research/pfweb/educators/intro/fingerflow.htm |title=Finger flow in coarse soils |website=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water uptake by plants===
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients. Most soil water is taken up by plants as passive [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] caused by the pulling force of water evaporating ([[transpiration|transpiring]]) from the long column of water ([[xylem sap]] flow) that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves, according to the [[cohesion-tension theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aston |first1=M.

Root extension is vital for plant survival. A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&amp;nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&amp;nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&amp;nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&amp;nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&amp;nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&amp;nbsp;square feet (83&amp;nbsp;ft squared). The total surface area of the loam soil was estimated to be 560,000&amp;nbsp;square feet.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=46}} In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil. However, root extension should be viewed as a dynamic process, allowing new roots to explore a new volume of soil each day, increasing dramatically the total volume of soil explored over a given growth period, and thus the volume of water taken up by the root system over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Paul J. |last2=Coile |first2=Theodore S. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |title=An estimation of the volume of water made available by root extension |year=1940 |pages=743–7 |doi=10.1104/pp.15.4.743 |pmid=16653671 |pmc=437871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root architecture, i.e. the spatial configuration of the root system, plays a prominent role in the adaptation of plants to soil water and nutrient availabiity, and thus in plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |title=Root architecture and plant productivity |year=1995 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.1.7 |pmid=12228579 |pmc=157559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots must seek out water as the unsaturated flow of water in soil can move only at a rate of up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch) per day; as a result they are constantly dying and growing as they seek out high concentrations of soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comas |first1=Louise H. |last2=Eissenstat |first2=David M. |last3=Lakso |first3=Alan N. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |title=Assessing root death and root system dynamics in a study of grape canopy pruning |year=2000 |pages=171–8 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00679.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient soil moisture, to the point of causing [[wilting]], will cause permanent damage and [[crop yield]]s will suffer.

===Consumptive use and water use efficiency===
Only a small fraction (0.1% to 1%) of the water used by a plant is held within the plant. The majority is ultimately lost via [[transpiration]], while [[evaporation]] from the soil surface is also substantial, the transpiration:evaporation ratio varying according to vegetation type and climate, peaking in [[tropical rainforests]] and dipping in [[steppes]] and [[deserts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=William H. |last2=Jasechko |first2=Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agricultural and Forest Meteorology]] |volume=189/190 |title=Transpiration in the global water cycle |url=http://www.isohydro.ca/uploads/1/4/1/9/14194300/2014-schlesinger-jasechko-agformet.pdf |year=2014 |pages=115–7 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.01.011 |accessdate=22 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2014AgFM..189..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration plus evaporative soil moisture loss is called [[evapotranspiration]].

The total water used in an agricultural field includes [[surface runoff]], [[drainage]] and consumptive use. The use of loose [[mulch]]es will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, but in the end the total evaporative loss (plant plus soil) will approach that of an uncovered soil, while more water is immediately available for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolk |first1=Judy A. |last2=Howell |first2=Terry A. |last3=Evett |first3=Steve R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=50 |issue=2 |title=Effect of mulch, irrigation, and soil type on water use and yield of maize |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=1896&amp;content=PDF |year=1999 |pages=137–47 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(99)00011-2 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water use efficiency]] is measured by the [[transpiration ratio]], which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700. For example, alfalfa may have a transpiration ratio of 500 and as a result 500&amp;nbsp;kilograms of water will produce one&amp;nbsp;kilogram of dry alfalfa.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=97–99}}

==Atmosphere==
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is radically different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of [[oxygen]] by microbes and plant roots, and their release of [[carbon dioxide]], decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil [[pore space]] it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous soils regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration thanks to [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respired accumulates in the soil pore system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_Karberg_001.pdf |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme levels CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.

# Crystalline Chain '''carbonate and sulfate minerals''': [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[dolomite]] (CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H2O).

# '''Sesquioxide clays''': old, highly leached clays which result in oxides of [[iron]], [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]].{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=101–07}}

====Alumino-silica clays====
'''Alumino-silica clays''' or [[aluminosilicate]] clays are characterised by their regular [[crystalline]] or quasi-crystalline structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aylmore |first1=L. A.

The substitution of lower-valence cations for higher-valence cations (isomorphous substitution) gives clay a local negative charge on an oxygen atom&lt;ref name="Barton2002"/&gt; that attracts and holds water and positively charged soil cations, some of which are of value for plant growth. Isomorphous substitution occurs during the clay's formation and does not change with time.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=107}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=20–21}}
* '''Montmorillonite''' clay is made of four planes of oxygen with two silicon and one central aluminium plane intervening. The alumino-silicate montmorillonite clay is said to have a 2:1 ratio of silicon to aluminium. The seven planes together form a single crystal of montmorillonite. The crystals are weakly held together and water may intervene, causing the clay to swell up to ten times its dry volume. It occurs in soils which have had little leaching, hence it is found in arid regions. As the crystals are not bonded face to face, the entire surface is exposed and available for surface reactions, hence it has a high cation exchange capacity (CEC).{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=108}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}
* '''Illite''' is a 2:1 clay similar in structure to montmorillonite but has potassium bridges between the faces of the clay crystals and the degree of swelling depends on the degree of weathering of the potassium. The active surface area is reduced due to the potassium bonds. Illite originates from the modification of mica, a primary mineral. It is often found together with montmorillonite and its primary minerals. It has moderate CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Vermiculite''' is a mica-based clay similar to illite, but the crystals of clay are held together more loosely by hydrated magnesium and it will swell, but not as much as does montmorillonite. It has very high CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=73}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Chlorite''' is similar to vermiculite, but the loose bonding by occasional hydrated magnesium, as in vermiculite, is replaced by a hydrated magnesium sheet, that firmly bonds the planes above and below it. It has two planes of silicon, one of aluminium and one of magnesium; hence it is a 2:2 clay. Chlorite does not swell and it has low CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|p=112}}
* '''Kaolinite''' is very common, highly weathered clay, and more common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even heavier weathering results in sesquioxide clays.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=33}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=101}}

====Crystalline chain clays====
The carbonate and sulfate minerals are much more soluble and hence are found primarily in desert soils where leaching is less active.

====Amorphous clays====
'''Amorphous clays''' are young, and commonly found in volcanic ash. They are mixtures of alumina and silica which have not formed the ordered crystal shape of alumino-silica clays which time would provide. The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH. They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions. As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}

====Sesquioxide clays====
'''[[Sesquioxide]] clays''' are a product of heavy rainfall that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It takes hundreds of thousands of years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. ''Sesqui'' is Latin for "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=103–12}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=18, 21–24, 29}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32, 35}}

===Organic colloids===
[[Humus]] is the final state of decomposition of organic matter. While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary. It is composed of the very stable [[lignin]]s (30%) and complex sugars ([[polyuronide]]s, 30%), proteins (30%), waxes, and fats that are resistant to breakdown by microbes. Its chemical assay is 60% carbon, 5% nitrogen, some oxygen and the remainder hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=112}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=35}}{{sfn|Allaway|1957|p=69}}

===Carbon and terra preta===
In the extreme environment of high temperatures and the leaching caused by the heavy rain of tropical rain forests, the clay and organic colloids are largely destroyed. The heavy rains wash the alumino-silicate clays from the soil leaving only sesquioxide clays of low CEC. The high temperatures and humidity allow bacteria and fungi to virtually dissolve any organic matter on the rain-forest floor overnight and much of the nutrients are volatilized or leached from the soil and lost. However, carbon in the form of charcoal is far more stable than soil colloids and is capable of performing many of the functions of the soil colloids of sub-tropical soils. Soil containing substantial quantities of charcoal, of an anthropogenic origin, is called [[terra preta]]. Research into terra preta is still young but is promising. Fallow periods "on the Amazonian Dark Earths can be as short as 6 months, whereas fallow periods on [[oxisol]]s are usually 8 to 10 years long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Terra Preta de Indio|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|publisher=University of Cornell, Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424061552/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{for|the [[academic discipline]]|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its microbial population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water. It is the surface chemistry of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties. "A colloid is a small, insoluble, nondiffusible particle larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in a fluid medium without settling. Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays." The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net charges, gives soil its ability to hold and release ions. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release cations in what is referred to as cation exchange. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release anions in the soil giving the soil [[cation-exchange capacity|anion exchange capacity]] (AEC).

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, buffers (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies percolating water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–06}}

# Isomorphous substitution occurs in clay during its formation, when lower-valence cations substitute for higher-valence cations in the crystal structure. Substitutions in the outermost layers are more effective than for the innermost layers, as the charge strength drops off as the square of the distance. The net result is oxygen atoms with net negative charge and the ability to attract cations.
# Edge-of-clay oxygen atoms are not in balance ionically as the tetrahedral and octahedral structures are incomplete.
# Hydroxyls may substitute for oxygens of the silica layers. When the hydrogens of the clay hydroxyls are ionised into solution, they leave the oxygen with a negative charge.
# Hydrogens of humus hydroxyl groups may be ionised into solution, leaving an oxygen with a negative charge.

Cations held to the negatively charged colloids resist being washed downward by water and out of reach of plants' roots, thereby preserving the fertility of soils in areas of moderate rainfall and low temperatures.

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as they differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another. If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; same as NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called mass action. This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low pH, and an abundance of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy those sites. A low pH may cause hydrogen of hydroxyl groups to be pulled into solution, leaving charged sites on the colloid available to be occupied by other cations. This ionisation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of soil colloids creates what is described as pH-dependent charges. Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Freed cations can be made available to plants but are also prone to be leached from the soil, possibly making the soil less fertile. Plants are able to excrete H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the soil and by that means, change the pH of the soil near the root and push cations off the colloids, thus making those available to the plant.

====Cation exchange capacity (CEC)====
Cation exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that will combine with 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (1&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of dry soil or 20&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=114}} The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.

Most of the soil's CEC occurs on clay and humus colloids, and the lack of those in hot, humid, wet climates, due to leaching and decomposition respectively, explains the relative sterility of tropical soils. Live plant roots also have some CEC.

====Anion exchange capacity (AEC)====
Anion exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove anions from the soil water solution and sequester those for later exchange as the plant roots release carbonate anions to the soil water solution. Those colloids which have low CEC tend to have some AEC. Amorphous and sesquioxide clays have the highest AEC, followed by the iron oxides. Levels of AEC are much lower than for CEC. Phosphates tend to be held at anion exchange sites.

Iron and aluminum hydroxide clays are able to exchange their hydroxide anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) for other anions. The order reflecting the strength of anion adhesion is as follows:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The amount of exchangeable anions is of a magnitude of tenths to a few milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;g dry soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=115–16}} As pH rises, there are relatively more hydroxyls, which will displace anions from the colloids and force them into solution and out of storage; hence AEC decreases with increasing pH (alkalinity).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−3.5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (hydrogen ions) per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−10.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole/litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−9.5&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−2.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole per litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydrogen ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5  = 6 or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) and is more acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0394329833|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of pH on a soil is to remove from the soil or to make available certain ions. Soils with high acidity tend to have toxic amounts of aluminium and manganese. Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils. Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&amp;nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&amp;nbsp;5.5.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–17}}

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain as those attach to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil sterile. Once the colloids are saturated with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH&amp;nbsp;10. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–19}}

====Base saturation percentage====
There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) and there are base-forming cations. The fraction of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base saturation percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100&amp;nbsp;percent and there are no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=119–20}}

===Buffering===
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, while soils high in colloids have high buffering capacity. Buffering occurs by cation exchange and neutralisation.

The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will displace hydrogen ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–21}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Plant nutrition|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Sixteen elements or nutrients are essential for plant growth and reproduction. They are [[carbon]] '''C''', [[hydrogen]] '''H''', [[oxygen]] '''O''', [[nitrogen]] '''N''', [[phosphorus]] '''P''', [[potassium]] '''K''', [[sulfur]] '''S''', [[calcium]] '''Ca''', [[magnesium]] '''Mg''', [[iron]] '''Fe''', [[boron]] '''B''', [[manganese]] '''Mn''', [[copper]] '''Cu''', [[zinc]] '''Zn''', [[molybdenum]] '''Mo''', [[nickel]] '''Ni''' and [[chlorine]] '''Cl'''.{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Russel|1957|pp=123–25}}&lt;ref name = BradyWeil&gt;{{cite book | title = The nature and properties of soils | year = 2008 | edition = 14th | last1 = Brady | first1 = Nyle C. | last2 = Weil | first2 = Ray R. | publisher = Pearson | location = Upper Saddle River, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients required for plants to complete their life cycle are considered '''essential nutrients'''. Nutrients that enhance the growth of plants but are not necessary to complete the plant's life cycle are considered '''non-essential'''. With the exception of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are supplied by carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen, provided through [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; the nutrients derive originally from the mineral component of the soil.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they [[weathering|weather]] too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, The application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=|isbn=978-9251054901|location=Rome|pages=43–90|chapter=Chapter 4: Soil fertility and crop production|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram for gram, the capacity of humus to hold nutrients and water is far greater than that of clay minerals. All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–31}}&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;

===Uptake processes===
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots. To be taken up by a plant, a nutrient element must be located near the root surface; however, the supply of nutrients in contact with the root is rapidly depleted. There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:

# Mass flow of water
# Diffusion within water
# Interception by root growth

All three mechanisms operate simultaneously, but one mechanism or another may be most important for a particular nutrient. For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface. However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion of molecules. By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as transpiration has almost stopped. Finally, root interception comes into play as roots continually grow into new, undepleted soil.

{| class="wikitable" style="border-spacing: 5px; margin:auto;"

In the above table, phosphorus and potassium nutrients move more by diffusion than they do by mass flow in the soil water solution, as they are rapidly taken up by the roots creating a concentration of almost zero near the roots (the plants cannot transpire enough water to draw more of those nutrients near the roots). The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement by mass flow requires the transpiration of water from the plant causing water and solution ions to also move toward the roots. Movement by root interception is slowest as the plants must extend their roots.

Plants move ions out of their roots in an effort to move nutrients in from the soil. Hydrogen H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is exchanged for other cations, and carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are exchanged for nutrient anions. As plant roots remove nutrients from the soil water solution, they are replenished as other ions move off of clay and humus (by [[ion exchange]] or [[desorption]]), are added from the [[weathering]] of soil minerals, and are released by the [[Soil organic matter#Decomposition|decomposition of soil organic matter]]. Plants derive a large proportion of their anion nutrients from decomposing organic matter, which typically holds about 95&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil nitrogen, 5 to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil phosphorus and about 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil sulfur. Where crops are produced, the replenishment of nutrients in the soil must usually be augmented by the addition of fertilizer or organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=126}}

Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake. Examples of such conditions include [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] or [[soil compaction]] resulting in poor soil aeration, excessively high or low soil temperatures, and above-ground conditions that result in low translocation of sugars to plant roots.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–28}}

===Carbon===
[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring soil respiration in the field using an SRS2000 system.]]
Plants obtain their carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's dry mass is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released as a byproduct which then finds its way out of the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=41}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|p=153}}

===Nitrogen===
{{Further|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:SoilNitrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Generalization of percent soil nitrogen by soil order}}]]
Nitrogen is the most critical element obtained by plants from the soil and [[nitrogen deficiency]] often limits plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=128}} Plants can use the nitrogen as either the ammonium cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the anion nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants. The total nitrogen content depends largely on the soil organic matter content, which in turn depends on the climate, vegetation, topography, age and soil management. Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils. Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.

Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the form of ammonia in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Both ammonium and nitrate can be ''immobilized'' by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered in the form of amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''. Nitrogen may also be ''leached'' from the soil if it is in the form of nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called ''volatilisation''. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by ''fixation''. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Allison|1957|pp=85–94}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|pp=152–55}}{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–31}}

====Gains====
In the process of [[mineralization (soil)|mineralisation]], microbes feed on organic matter, releasing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and other nutrients. As long as the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fresh residues in the soil is above 30:1, nitrogen will be in short supply and other bacteria will feed on the ammonium and incorporate its nitrogen into their cells in the [[immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]] process. In that form the nitrogen is said to be ''immobilised''. Later, when such bacteria die, they too are ''mineralised'' and some of the nitrogen is released as ammonium and nitrate. If the C/N is less than 15, ammonia is freed to the soil, where it may be used by bacteria which [[redox|oxidise]] it to nitrate ([[nitrification]]). Bacteria may on average add {{convert|25|lb}} nitrogen per acre, and in an unfertilised field, this is the most important source of usable nitrogen. In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition. It occurs fastest in warm, moist, well aerated soil. The mineralisation of 3% of the organic material of a soil that is 4% organic matter overall, would release {{convert|120|lb}} of nitrogen as ammonium per acre.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=129–30}}

In [[nitrogen fixation]], [[rhizobium]] bacteria convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Rhizobia]] share a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment. It is estimated that such symbiotic bacteria in the [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s add 45 to 250&amp;nbsp;pounds of nitrogen per acre per year, which may be sufficient for the crop. Other, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and [[blue-green algae]] live independently in the soil and release nitrate when their dead bodies are converted by way of mineralisation.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–29}}

Some amount of usable nitrogen is fixed by [[lightning]] as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide is soluble in water to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, previously released from the soil or from combustion, may fall with precipitation as nitric acid at a rate of about five pounds nitrogen per acre per year.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=87}}

====Sequestration====
When bacteria feed on soluble forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), they temporarily sequester that nitrogen in their bodies in a process called ''immobilisation''. At a later time when those bacteria die, their nitrogen may be released as ammonium by the processes of mineralisation.

Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers. The layers are small enough that bacteria cannot enter. Some organisms can exude extracellular enzymes that can act on the sequestered proteins. However, those enzymes too may be trapped on the clay crystals.

Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes [[potassium]] ions from between the layers of clay such as [[illite]] or [[montmorillonite]]. Only a small fraction of soil nitrogen is held this way.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}

====Losses====
Usable nitrogen may be lost from soils when it is in the form of nitrate, as it is easily [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]]. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This occurs when poor [[soil aeration]] limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of nitrate applied as fertiliser may occur.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=130}}

''Ammonium volatilisation'' occurs when ammonium reacts chemically with an alkaline soil, converting NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of ammonium fertiliser to such a field can result in volatilisation losses of as much as 30 percent.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Phosphorus===
After nitrogen, phosphorus is probably the element most likely to be deficient in soils. The soil mineral [[apatite]] is the most common mineral source of phosphorus. While there is on average 1000&amp;nbsp;lb of phosphorus per acre in the soil, it is generally in the form of phosphates with low solubility. Total phosphorus is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent by weight of the soil, but only one percent of that is available. Of the part available, more than half comes from the mineralisation of organic matter. Agricultural fields may need to be fertilised to make up for the phosphorus that has been removed in the crop.{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}

When phosphorus does form solubilised ions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, they rapidly form insoluble phosphates of calcium or hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil and is not leached but actually builds up in the surface layer if not cropped. The application of soluble fertilisers to soils may result in zinc deficiencies as zinc phosphates form. Conversely, the application of zinc to soils may immobilise phosphorus again as zinc phosphate. Lack of phosphorus may interfere with the normal opening of the plant leaf stomata, resulting in plant temperatures 10 percent higher than normal. Phosphorus is most available when soil pH is 6.5 in mineral soils and 5.5 in organic soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Potassium===
The amount of potassium in a soil may be as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb per acre-foot, of which only 150&amp;nbsp;lb is available for plant growth. Common mineral sources of potassium are the mica [[biotite]] and potassium feldspar, KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. When solubilised, half will be held as exchangeable cations on clay while the other half is in the soil water solution. Potassium fixation often occurs when soils dry and the potassium is bonded between layers of illite clay. Under certain conditions, dependent on the soil texture, intensity of drying, and initial amount of exchangeable potassium, the fixed percentage may be as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent within ten minutes. Potassium may be leached from soils low in clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|pp=101–04}}

===Calcium===
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant in the form of exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=135–36}}

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is one of the dominant exchangeable cations in most soils (as are calcium and potassium). Primary minerals that weather to release magnesium include [[hornblende]], [[biotite]] and [[vermiculite]]. Soil magnesium concentrations are generally sufficient for optimal plant growth, but highly weathered and sandy soils may be magnesium deficient due to leaching by heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}}

===Sulfur===
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}} Deficiencies may exist in some soils (especially sandy soils) and if cropped, sulfur needs to be added. The application of large quantities of nitrogen to fields that have marginal amounts of sulfur may cause sulfur deficiency in the rapidly growing plants by the plant's growth outpacing the supply of sulfur. A 15-ton crop of onions uses up to 19&amp;nbsp;lb of sulfur and 4&amp;nbsp;tons of alfalfa uses 15&amp;nbsp;lb per acre. Sulfur abundance varies with depth. In a sample of soils in Ohio, United States, the sulfur abundance varied with depths, 0-6&amp;nbsp;inches, 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches, 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches, 18-24&amp;nbsp;inches in the amounts: 1056, 830, 686, 528&amp;nbsp;lb per acre respectively.{{sfn|Jordan|Reisenauer|1957|p=107}}

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients essential in plant life, in their order of importance, include  [[iron]],{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|pp=111}} [[manganese]],{{sfn|Sherman|1957|p=135}} [[zinc]],{{sfn|Seatz|Jurinak|1957|p=115}} [[copper]],{{sfn|Reuther|1957|p=128}} [[boron]],{{sfn|Russel|1957|p=121}} [[chlorine]]{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=146}} and [[molybdenum]].{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=141}} The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil. They are required in very small amounts but are essential to plant health in that most are required parts of some enzyme system which speeds up plants' metabolisms. They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates. Iron deficiency may also result from excessive amounts of heavy metals or calcium minerals (lime) in the soil. Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=107}}

===Non-essential nutrients===
Nutrients which enhance the health but whose deficiency does not stop the life cycle of plants include: [[cobalt]], [[strontium]], [[vanadium]], [[silicon]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria Pereira|first1=B.F.|title=Nutrients and Nonessential Elements in Soil after 11 Years of Wastewater Irrigation|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/3/920|website=ACSESS Digital Library|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their importance are evaluated they may be added to the list of essential plant nutrients.

==Soil organic matter==
{{main|Soil organic matter}}
Soil organic matter is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead. A typical soil has a biomass composition of 70% microorganisms, 22% macrofauna, and 8% roots. The living component of an acre of soil may include 900&amp;nbsp;lb of earthworms, 2400&amp;nbsp;lb of fungi, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb of bacteria, 133&amp;nbsp;lb of protozoa and 890&amp;nbsp;lb of arthropods and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pimentel, D.|display-authors=etal|year=1995|title=Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|pages=1117–22|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1117P |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5201.1117|issue=24|pmid=17789193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small part of the organic matter consists of the living cells such as bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes that work to break down the dead organic matter. Were it not for the action of these micro-organisms, the entire carbon dioxide part of the atmosphere would be sequestered as organic matter in the soil.

Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:

# Polysaccharides
## cellulose
## hemicellulose
## starch
## pectin
# Lignins
# Proteins

Most living things in soils, including plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on the temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by amoebas, which in turn are fed upon by nematodes and arthropods. Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.&lt;ref name=Foth1984&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foth | first = Henry D. | year = 1984 | title = Fundamentals of soil science | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0471889267 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

===Humus===
[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown. Humus usually constitutes only five percent of the soil or less by volume, but it is an essential source of nutrients and adds important textural qualities crucial to [[soil health]] and plant growth. Humus also hold bits of undecomposed organic matter which feed arthropods and worms which further improve the soil. The end product, humus, is soluble in water and forms a weak acid that can attack silicate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilluly, Waters, Woodford|title=Principles of Geology|year=1975|edition=4th|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=USA|isbn=978-0716702696|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humus is a colloid with a high cation and anion exchange capacity that on a dry weight basis is many times greater than that of clay colloids. It also acts as a buffer, like clay, against changes in pH and soil moisture.

[[Humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, which begin as raw organic matter, are important constituents of humus. After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.

Lignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.&lt;ref name=Verkaik2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) forests |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=287 |pages=337–45 |doi=10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8 |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/25615 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierer2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fierer |first=N. |last2=Schimel |first2=Joshua P. |last3=Cates |first3=Rex G. |last4=Zou |first4=Jiping |title=Influence of balsam poplar tannin fractions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Alaskan taiga floodplain soils |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=2001 |volume=33 |pages=1827–39 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00111-0 |issue=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].&lt;ref name="Foth1984"/&gt; Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.

===Climatological influence===
The production, accumulation and degradation of organic matter are greatly dependent on climate. Temperature, soil moisture and [[topography]] are the major factors affecting the accumulation of organic matter in soils. Organic matter tends to accumulate under wet or cold conditions where [[decomposer]] activity is impeded by low temperature&lt;ref name="Wagai2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagai |first=Rota |last2=Mayer |first2=Lawrence M. |last3=Kitayama |first3=Kanehiro |last4=Knicker |first4=Heike |date=2008 |title=Climate and parent material controls on organic matter storage in surface soils: A three-pool, density-separation approach |journal=Geoderma |volume=147 |issue=1–2 |pages=23–33 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.07.010|bibcode=2008Geode.147...23W |url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/82461/1/Acceso%20restringido%20Digital%20CSIC.pdf |format=Submitted manuscript |hdl=10261/82461 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or excess moisture which results in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name="Minayeva2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Minayeva |first=T.

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a [[soil horizon]]. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers&lt;ref name=Retallack1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Retallack | first = G.

Some may have only one horizon.

The exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

Soil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref name=IUSS2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=IUSS Working Group WRB|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014.

====United States====
{{Main|USDA soil taxonomy#Orders}}

A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html The Soil Orders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112143347/http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html |date=12 January 2010 }}, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=411–32}}  The names of the orders end with the suffix ''-sol''. The criteria for the different soil orders include properties that reflect major differences in the genesis of soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soil Survey Staff|title=Soil taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys. 2nd edition.

* [[Alfisol]] – soils with [[aluminium]] and [[iron]]. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* [[Andisol]] – volcanic ash soils. They are young and very fertile. They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
* [[Aridisol]] – dry soils forming under [[desert]] conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of [[caliche]] or [[duripan]]. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* [[Entisol]] – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* [[Gelisol]] – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* [[Histosol]] – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* [[Inceptisol]] – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* [[Mollisol]] – soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* [[Oxisol]] – are heavily [[weathered]], are rich in iron and aluminum oxides ([[sesquioxides]]) or [[kaolin]] but low in [[silica]]. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low [[Cation-exchange capacity|CEC]] of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* [[Spodosol]] – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* [[Ultisol]] – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (important [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]). They are highly [[weathered]], but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* [[Vertisol]] – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

"Soils of Mountains", which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as "Rugged Mountains" which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The '''soil suborders''' within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of '''soil subgroups''': typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

A '''soil family''' category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale's precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=409–10}}

A family may contain several '''soil series''' which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the [[Merrimack River]] in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

A '''soil phase of series''', originally called 'soil type' describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants; however, as demonstrated by [[hydroponics]], it is not essential to plant growth if the soil-contained nutrients can be dissolved in a solution. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated.

Soil material is also a critical component in the mining, construction and landscape development industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Soils for Landscape Development |author1=Leake, Simon|author2=Haege, Elke|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0643109643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects. The movement of massive volumes of soil can be involved in [[surface mining]], road building and dam construction. [[Earth sheltering]] is the architectural practice of using soil for external [[thermal mass]] against building walls. Many [[building material]]s are soil based.

Soil resources are critical to the environment, as well as to food and fibre production. Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later, thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans water as it percolates through it. Soil is the habitat for many organisms: the major part of known and unknown [[biodiversity]] is in the soil, in the form of [[invertebrates]] ([[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[mite]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[Enchytraeidae|enchytraeids]], [[nematode]]s, [[protist]]s), [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], fungi and [[algae]]; and most organisms living above ground have part of them ([[plants]]) or spend part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[insects]]) below-ground. Above-ground and below-ground biodiversities are tightly interconnected,&lt;ref name="Ponge2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ponge| first = Jean-François| year = 2003| title = Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity| journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume = 35| issue = 7| pages = 935–45| doi = 10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| format = PDF| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| archivedate = 29 January 2016| df = dmy-all| citeseerx = 10.1.1.467.4937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Deyn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Deyn |first=Gerlinde B. |last2=Van der Putten |first2=Wim H. |date=2005 |title=Linking aboveground and belowground diversity |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |pages=625–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.009 |pmid=16701446 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making soil protection of paramount importance for any restoration or conservation plan.

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even on desert crusts, cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by photosynthesis. Poor farming and grazing methods have degraded soils and released much of this sequestered carbon to the atmosphere. Restoring the world's soils could offset the effect of increases in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and slow global warming, while improving crop yields and reducing water needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Hansen, J. |display-authors = etal |journal=Open Atmospheric Science Journal|year=2008|volume= 2|issue = 1 |pages= 217–31 | title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|arxiv = 0804.1126 |bibcode = 2008OASJ....2..217H |doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using aerobic soil processes. [[Landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]]. Land application of waste water relies on soil biology to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

Organic soils, especially [[peat]], serve as a significant fuel resource; but wide areas of peat production, such as [[sphagnum]] [[bog]]s, are now protected because of patrimonial interest.

[[Geophagy]] is the practice of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes. It has been shown that some [[monkeys]] consume soil, together with their preferred food (tree [[foliage]] and [[fruits]]), in order to alleviate [[tannin]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Setz1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Setz| first = EZF| authorlink =  |author2=Enzweiler J |author3=Solferini VN |author4=Amendola MP |author5=Berton RS | year = 1999| title = Geophagy in the golden-faced saki monkey (Pithecia pithecia chrysocephala) in the Central Amazon| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 247| issue=1|pages = 91–103| doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1999.tb00196.x | url = https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/1059/Setz-et-al-1999.pdf| format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degradation==
{{Main|Soil retrogression and degradation}}
[[Land degradation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Bassett | first3 = T.J. | last4 = Bowen | first4 = M.L. | last5 = Crummey | first5 = D.E. | last6 = Isaacson | first6 = J.S. | last7 = Johnson | first7 = D.N. | last8 = Lamb | first8 = P. | last9 = Saul | first9 = M. | year = 1997 | title = Meanings of environmental terms | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 581–89 | doi=10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600030002x | last10 = Winter-Nelson | first10 = A. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a human-induced or natural process which impairs the capacity of [[land (economics)|land]] to function. Soils degradation involves the [[Soil acidification|acidification]], [[soil contamination|contamination]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]] or [[Soil salinity|salination]].

[[Soil acidification]] is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion. Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].

[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation.

[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.

Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602–10 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | postscript = . | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater. [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] with higher levels of applied water in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands | year = 1993 | publisher = Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0160616235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816225219/http://www.waterlog.info/ |archivedate=16 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclamation==
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.&lt;ref name="Water Management Institute2010"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |author=International Water Management Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition. Adding organic matter (like [[ramial chipped wood]] for instance) to soil which is depleted in nutrients and too high in sand will boost its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Provide for your garden's basic needs ... and the plants will take it from there|date=10 March 2011|journal=USA Weekend|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209012951/http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
