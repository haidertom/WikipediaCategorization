'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

{{Meso myth}}
{{Ancient Near East mythology}}
'''Mesopotamian religion''' refers to the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of the civilizations of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], particularly [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]] between circa 3500 BC and 400 AD, after which they largely gave way to [[Syriac Christianity]]. The religious development of Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian culture in general was not particularly influenced by the movements of the various peoples into and throughout the area, particularly the south. Rather, Mesopotamian religion was a consistent and coherent tradition which adapted to the internal needs of its adherents over millennia of development.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mesopotamian-religion|title=Mesopotamian religion|publisher=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest undercurrents of Mesopotamian religious thought date to the mid 4th millennium BC, and involved the [[nature worship|worship of forces of nature]] as providers of sustenance. In the 3rd millennium BC objects of worship were personified and became an expansive cast of divinities with particular functions. The last stages of Mesopotamian polytheism, which developed in the 2nd and 1st millenniums, introduced greater emphasis on personal religion and structured the gods into a monarchical hierarchy with the national god being the head of the pantheon.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Mesopotamian religion finally declined with the spread of Iranian religions during the Achaemenid Empire and with the [[Christianization]] of Mesopotamia.

== History ==
{{See also|Sumerian religion|Babylonian religion}}
[[File:Mesopotamia.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Overview map of ancient Mesopotamia.]]
In the fourth millennium BC, the first evidence for what is recognisably Mesopotamian religion can be seen with the invention in Mesopotamia of [[writing]] circa 3500 BC.

The people of Mesopotamia originally consisted of two groups, [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian speakers]] (later divided into the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) and the people of [[Sumer]], who spoke a [[language isolate]]. These peoples were members of various [[city-state]]s and small [[monarchy|kingdoms]]. The Sumerians left the first records, and are believed to have been the founders of the civilisation of the [[Ubaid period]] (6500 BC to 3800 BC) in [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. By historical times they resided in southern Mesopotamia, which was known as [[Sumer]] (and much later, [[Babylonia]]), and had considerable influence on the Akkadian speakers and their culture. The Akkadian-speaking [[Semites]] are believed to have entered the region at some point between 3500 BC and 3000 BC, with Akkadian names first appearing in the regnal lists of these states c. 29th century BC.

The Sumerians were advanced: as well as inventing [[writing]], they also invented early forms of [[mathematics]], early [[wheel]]ed vehicles/[[chariot]]s, [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], written [[code of law]], organised [[medicine]], advanced [[agriculture]] and [[architecture]], and the [[calendar]]. They created the first [[city-state]]s such as [[Uruk]], [[Ur]], [[Lagash]], [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Umma]], [[Eridu]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Akshak]], [[Sippar]], [[Nippur]] and [[Larsa]], each of them ruled by an ''[[ensí]]''. The Sumerians remained largely dominant in this synthesised culture, however, until the rise of the [[Akkadian Empire]] under [[Sargon of Akkad]] circa 2335 BC, which united all of Mesopotamia under one ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:7–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was increasing [[syncretism]] between the Sumerian and Akkadian cultures and deities, with the Akkadians typically preferring to worship fewer [[deity|deities]] but elevating them to greater positions of power. Circa 2335 BC, [[Sargon of Akkad]] conquered all of Mesopotamia, uniting its inhabitants into the world's first empire and spreading its domination into ancient [[Iran]], the [[Levant]], [[Anatolia]], [[Canaan]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Akkadian Empire endured for two centuries before collapsing due to economic decline, internal strife and attacks from the north east by the [[Gutian people]].

Following a brief Sumerian revival with the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] or [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]], Mesopotamia broke up into a number of Akkadian states. [[Assyria]] had evolved during the 25th century BC, and asserted itself in the north circa 2100 BC in the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] and southern Mesopotamia fragmented into a number of kingdoms, the largest being Isin, Larsa and [[Eshnunna]].

In 1894 BC the initially minor city-state of [[Babylon]] was founded in the south by invading [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]]-speaking [[Amorites]]. It was rarely ruled by native dynasties throughout its history.

Some time after this period, the Sumerians disappeared, becoming wholly absorbed into the Akkadian-speaking population.

Assyrian kings are attested from the late 25th century BC and dominated northern Mesopotamia and parts of eastern [[Anatolia]] and northeast [[Syria]].

Circa 1750 BC, the Amorite ruler of Babylon, King [[Hammurabi]], conquered much of Mesopotamia, but this empire collapsed after his death, and Babylonia was reduced to the small state it had been upon its founding. The Amorite dynasty was deposed in 1595 BC after attacks from mountain-dwelling people known as the [[Kassites]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]], who went on to rule Babylon for over 500 years.

Assyria, having been the dominant power in the region with the Old Assyrian Empire between the 20th and 18th centuries BC before the rise of Hammurabi, once more became a major power with the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1391–1050 BC). Assyria defeated the [[Hittites]] and [[Mitanni]], and its growing power forced the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] to withdraw from the [[Near East]]. The Middle Assyrian Empire at its height stretched from the [[Caucasus]] to modern [[Bahrain]] and from [[Cyprus]] to western Iran.

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) was the most dominant power on earth and the largest empire the world had yet seen between the 10th century BC and the late 7th century BC, with an empire stretching from [[Cyprus]] in the west to central [[Iran]] in the east, and from the [[Caucasus]] in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]] and the Arabian Peninsula in the south, facilitating the spread of Mesopotamian culture and religion far and wide under emperors such as [[Ashurbanipal]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser IV]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. During the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Mesopotamian [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the empire, and also Mesopotamia proper. The last written records in Akkadian were [[astrology|astrological texts]] dating from 78 CE discovered in Assyria.

The empire fell between 612 BC and 599 BC after a period of severe internal civil war in Assyria which soon spread to Babylonia, leaving Mesopotamia in a state of chaos. A weakened Assyria was then subject to combined attacks by a coalition of hitherto vassals, in the form of the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Sagartians]] and [[Cimmerians]] beginning in 616 BC. These were led by [[Nabopolassar]] of Babylon and [[Cyaxares]] of Media and Persia. [[Nineveh]] was sacked in 612 BC, [[Harran]] fell in 608 BC, [[Carchemish]] in 605 BC, and final traces of Assyrian imperial administration disappeared from [[Dūr-Katlimmu]] by 599 BC.

Babylon had a brief late flowering of power and influence, initially under the migrant Chaldean dynasty, which took over much of the empire formerly held by their northern kinsmen. However, the last king of Babylonia, [[Nabonidus]], an Assyrian, paid little attention to politics, preferring to worship the [[lunar deity]] [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], leaving day-to-day rule to his son [[Belshazzar]]. This and the fact that the [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Medes]] to the east were growing in power now that the might of Assyria that had held them in [[vassal]]age for centuries was gone, spelt the death knell for native Mesopotamian power. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 539 BC, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, although Mesopotamian people, culture and religion continued to endure after this.

=== Effect of Assyrian religious beliefs on its political structure ===
Like many nations in Mesopotamian history, Assyria was originally, to a great extent, an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with "the city", and the [[polity]] had three main centres of power—an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for "king", ''šarrum''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], of whom the ruler was the [[high priest]]. The ruler himself was only designated as "steward of Assur" (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ''ensí''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the [[eponymous archon]] and [[Roman consul]]s of [[classical antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Larsen, Mogens Trolle |year=2000 |chapter=The old Assyrian city-state |editor-last=Hansen |editor-first=Mogens Herman |title=A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre |pages=77–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Refers to entire paragraph on political structure --&gt;

==== Religion in the Neo-Assyrian Empire ====
The religion of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] centered around the Assyrian king as the king of their lands as well. However, kingship at the time was linked very closely with the idea of divine mandate.&lt;ref name="Bertman66"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian king, while not being a god himself, was acknowledged as the chief servant of the chief god, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. In this manner, the king's authority was seen as absolute so long as the high priest reassured the peoples that the gods, or in the case of the [[Henotheism|henotheistic]] Assyrians, the God, was pleased with the current ruler.&lt;ref name="Bertman66" /&gt; For the Assyrians who lived in [[Assur]] and the surrounding lands, this system was the norm. For the conquered peoples, however, it was novel, particularly to the people of smaller city-states. In time, Ashur was promoted from being the local deity of Assur to the overlord of the vast Assyrian domain, which spread from the Caucasus and [[Armenia]] in the north to Egypt, Nubia and the Arabian Peninsula in the south, and from Cyprus and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to central Iran in the east.&lt;ref name="Bertman66" /&gt; [[Ashur (god)|Assur]], the patron deity of the city of Assur from the late [[Bronze Age]], was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of Babylon, [[Marduk]]. Worship was conducted in his name throughout the lands dominated by the Assyrians. With the worship of Assur across much of the [[Fertile Crescent]], the Assyrian king could command the loyalty of his fellow servants of Assur.

=== Later Mesopotamian history ===
In 539 BC, Mesopotamia was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BC), then ruled by [[Cyrus the Great]]. This brought to an end over 3,000 years of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] Mesopotamian dominance of the Near East. The [[Persian people|Persians]] maintained and did not interfere in the native culture and religion and Assyria and Babylon continued to exist as entities (although Chaldea and the Chaldeans disappeared), and Assyria was strong enough to launch major rebellions against [[Persia]] in 522 and 482 BC. During this period the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved in Assyria, and were centuries later to be the vehicle for the spread of [[Syriac Christianity]] throughout the near east.

Then, two centuries later in 330 BC the [[Macedon]]ian [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] emperor [[Alexander the Great]] overthrew the Persians and took control of Mesopotamia itself. After Alexander's death increased [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] influence was brought to the region by the [[Seleucid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:17–18)&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria and Babylonia later became provinces under the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[Athura]] and province of [[Persian Babylonia|Babylonia]]), [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (province of [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]]) and [[Sassanid Empire]] (province of [[Asuristan]]). Babylonia was dissolved as an entity during the Parthian Empire, though Assyria endured as a geo-political entity until the 7th century AD [[Arab]] [[Islamic conquest]].

During the [[Parthian Empire]] there was a major revival in Assyria (known as [[Athura]] and [[Assuristan]]) between the 2nd century BC and 4th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;^ Crone &amp; Cook 1977, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; with temples once more being dedicated to gods such as Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Hadad and Ishtar in independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Beth Garmai]], [[Hatra]] and [[Beth Nuhadra]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003). "The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq" (PDF). L’archéologie de l’empire achéménide (Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crone &amp; Cook 1977, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Christianization of Mesopotamia beginning in the 1st century CE the independent Assyrian states of [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Assur]], [[Hatra]], [[Beth Nuhadra]] and [[Beth Garmai]] were largely ruled by converts to home grown forms of still extant [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] in the form of the [[Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], as well as [[Judaism]]. [[Gnostic]] sects such as [[Sabianism]] and the still extant [[Mandeanism]] also became popular, though native religions still coexisted alongside these new [[monotheistic]] religions among the native populace; gods such as Ashur and Sin were still worshiped until the 4th century CE in Assyria. In the 3rd century CE another native Mesopotamian religion flourished, [[Manicheanism]], which incorporated elements of Christianity, Judaism, [[Buddhism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], as well as local Mesopotamian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Widengren |first=Geo  |title=Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion |publisher=Lundequistska bokhandeln |year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Mesopotamian myths}}

There are no specific written records explaining Mesopotamian [[religious cosmology]] that survive to us today. Nonetheless, modern scholars have examined various accounts, and created what is believed to be an at least partially accurate depiction of Mesopotamian cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:77–78)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Epic of Creation'', dated to 1200 BC, it explains that the god Marduk killed the mother goddess [[Tiamat]] and used half her body to create the earth, and the other half to create both the [[paradise]] of ''šamû'' and the [[underworld|netherworld]] of ''irṣitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:79)&lt;/ref&gt; A document from a similar period stated that the universe was a spheroid, with three levels of ''šamû'', where the gods dwelt, and where the stars existed, above the three levels of earth below it.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:80)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deities ===
{{further|List of Mesopotamian deities}}

[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The goddess [[Ishtar]], winged and wearing a version of the horned cap of divinity. Detail of the so-called "Ishtar vase", early 2nd millennium BC ([[Louvre]] AO 17000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeremy Black |author2=Anthony Green |title=Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], thereby accepting the existence of many different deities, both male and female, though it was also [[henotheism|henotheistic]],&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:41)&lt;/ref&gt; with certain gods being viewed as superior to others by their specific devotees. These devotees were often from a particular city or city-state that held that deity as its [[patron]] deity, for instance the god [[Enki]] was often associated with the city of [[Eridu]] in Sumer, the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] with [[Assur]] and [[Assyria]], [[Enlil]] with the Sumerian city of [[Nippur]], [[Ishtar]] with the Assyrian city of [[Erbil|Arbela]], and the god [[Marduk]] was associated with [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:53)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the full number of gods and goddesses found in Mesopotamia is not known, K. Tallqvist, in his ''Akkadische Götterepitheta'' (1938) counted around two thousand four hundred that we now know about, most of which had Sumerian names. In the [[Sumerian language]], the gods were referred to as ''dingir'', while in the Akkadian language they were known as ''ilu'' and it seems that there was syncreticism between the gods worshipped by the two groups, adopting one another's deities.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:45" /&gt;

The Mesopotamian gods bore many similarities with humans, and were [[anthropomorphic]], thereby having humanoid form. Similarly, they often acted like humans, requiring food and drink, as well as drinking alcohol and subsequently suffering the effects of [[drunkenness]],&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:64–66)&lt;/ref&gt; but were thought to have a higher degree of perfection than common men. They were thought to be more powerful, all-seeing and all-knowing, unfathomable, and, above all, immortal. One of their prominent features was a terrifying brightness (''melammu'') which surrounded them, producing an immediate reaction of awe and reverence among men.&lt;ref name="Ringgren_a"&gt;Ringgren (1974: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the various deities were family relations of one another, a trait found in many other polytheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:50)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian J. Bottéro was of the opinion that the gods were not viewed [[mysticism|mystically]], but were instead seen as high-up masters who had to be obeyed and feared, as opposed to loved and adored.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:37"&gt;Bottéro (2001:37)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many Mesopotamians, of all classes, often had names that were devoted to a certain deity; this practice appeared to have begun in the third millennium BC among the Sumerians, but also was later adopted by the Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:39)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] was not ordered, but later Mesopotamian theologians came up with the concept of ranking the deities in order of importance. A Sumerian list of around 560 deities that did this was uncovered at Farm and Tell Abû Ṣalābīkh and dated to circa 2600 BC, ranking five primary deities as being of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:48–49)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important of these early Mesopotamian deities was the god [[Enlil]], who was originally a Sumerian divinity viewed as a king of the gods and a controller of the world, who was later adopted by the Akkadians. Another was the Sumerian god An, who served a similar role to Enlil and became known as [[Anu]] among the Akkadians. The Sumerian god [[Enki]] was later also adopted by the Akkadians, initially under his original name, and later as [[Éa (Babylonian god)|Éa]]. Similarly the Sumerian moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] became the Akkadian Sîn while the Sumerian sun god [[Utu]] became the Akkadian [[Shamash]]. One of the most notable goddesses was the Sumerian sex and war deity [[Inanna]]. With the later rise to power of the Babylonians in the 18th century BC, the king, [[Hammurabi]], declared Marduk, a deity who before then had not been of significant importance, to a position of supremacy alongside Anu and Enlil in southern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:54)&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most significant legend to survive from Mesopotamian religion is the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], which tells the story of the heroic king [[Gilgamesh]] and his wild friend [[Enkidu]], and the former's search for immortality which is entwined with all the gods and their approval. It also contains the earliest reference to [[The Great Flood]].

== Cultic practice ==
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="[[Enlil]]! his authority is far-reaching; his word is sublime and holy. His decisions are unalterable; he decides fate forever! His eyes scrutinize the entire world!"|source=A prayer to the god Enlil.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:30–31)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Public devotions ===
{{see|Mesopotamian temple}}
Each Mesopotamian city was home to a deity, and each of the prominent deities was the patron of a city, and all known temples were located in cities, though there may have been shrines in the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011: 39)&lt;/ref&gt; The temple itself was constructed of mud brick in the form of a [[ziggurat]], which rose to the sky in a series of stairstep stages. Its significance and symbolism have been the subject of much discussion, but most regard the tower as a kind of staircase or ladder for the god to descend from and ascend to the heavens, though there are signs which point towards an actual cult having been practiced in the upper temple, so the entire temple may have been regarded as a giant altar. Other theories treat the tower as an image of the cosmic mountain where a dying and rising god "lay buried." Some temples, such as the temple of Enki in Eridu contained a holy tree (''kiskanu'') in a holy grove, which was the central point of various rites performed by the king, who functioned as a "master gardener."&lt;ref name="Ringgren"&gt;Ringgren (1974:78)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesopotamian temples were originally built to serve as dwelling places for the god, who was thought to reside and hold court on earth for the good of the city and kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2001: 66)&lt;/ref&gt; His presence was symbolized by an image of the god in a separate room. The god's presence within the image seems to have been thought of in a very concrete way, as instruments for the presence of the deity."&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:77)&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident from the poem ''How Erra Wrecked the World'', in which [[Erra (god)|Erra]] deceived the god Marduk into leaving his [[Cult image|cult statue]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:65)&lt;/ref&gt; Once constructed, idols were consecrated through special nocturnal rituals where they were given "life", and their mouth "was opened" (''pet pî'') and washed (''mes pî'') so they could see and eat.&lt;ref name="Ringgren" /&gt; If the deity approved, it would accept the image and agree to "inhabit" it. These images were also entertained, and sometime escorted on hunting expeditions. In order to service the gods, the temple was equipped with a household with kitchens and kitchenware, sleeping rooms with beds and side rooms for the deity's family, as well as a courtyard with a basin and water for cleansing visitors, as well as a stable for the god's chariot and draft animals.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011:68)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the god's well-being was maintained through service, or work (''dullu''). The image was dressed and served banquets twice a day. It is not known how the god was thought to consume the food, but a curtain was drawn before the table while he or she "ate", just as the king himself was not allowed to be seen by the masses while he ate. Occasionally, the king shared in these meals, and the priests may have had some share in the offerings as well. Incense was also burned before the image, because it was thought that the gods enjoyed the smell. Sacrificial meals were also set out regularly, with a sacrificial animal seen as a replacement (''pūhu'') or substitute (''dinānu'') for a man, and it was considered that the anger of the gods or demons was then directed towards the sacrificial animal. Additionally, certain days required extra sacrifices and ceremonies for certain gods, and every day was sacred to a particular god.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 81–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was thought, in theory, to be the religious leader (''enu'' or ''šangū'') of the cult and exercised a large number of duties within the temple, with a large number of specialists whose task was to mediate between men and gods:&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 79)&lt;/ref&gt; a supervising or "watchman" priest (''šešgallu''), priests for individual purification against demons and magicians (''āšipu''), priests for the purification of the temple (''mašmašu''), priests to appease the wrath of the gods with song and music (''kalū''), as well as female singers (''nāru''), male singers (''zammeru''), craftsmen (''mārē ummāni''), swordbearers (''nāš paṭri''), masters of divination (''[[bārû]]''), penitents (''šā'ilu''), and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:80)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private devotions ===
Besides the worship of the gods at public rituals, individuals also paid homage to a personal deity. As with other deities, the personal gods changed over time and little is known about early practice as they are rarely named or described. In the mid-third millennium BC, some rulers regarded a particular god or gods as being their personal protector. In the second millennium BC, personal gods began to function more on behalf of the common man,&lt;ref name="Schneider 2011: 59"&gt;Schneider (2011: 59)&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had a close, personal relationship, maintained through prayer and maintenance of his god's statue.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:91ff"&gt;Bottéro (2001:91ff)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of written [[prayers]] have survived from ancient Mesopotamia, each of which typically exalt the god that they are describing above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:29–30)&lt;/ref&gt; The historian J. Bottéro stated that these poems display "extreme reverence, profound devotion, [and] the unarguable emotion that the [[supernatural]] evoked in the hearts of those ancient believers" but that they showed a people who were scared of their gods rather than openly celebrating them.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:37" /&gt; They were thought to offer good luck, success, and protection from disease and demons,&lt;ref name="Schneider 2011: 59"/&gt; and one's place and success in society was thought to depend on his personal deity, including the development of his certain talents and even his personality. This was even taken to the point that everything he experienced was considered a reflection of what was happening to his personal god.&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:91ff"/&gt; When a man neglected his god, it was assumed that the demons were free to inflict him, and when he revered his god, that god was like a shepherd who seeks food for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhorme |first=P. |year=1910 |title=La Religion Assyro-Babylonienne |location=Paris |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a strong belief in [[demons]] in Mesopotamia, and private individuals, like the temple priests, also participated in incantations (šiptu) to ward them off.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 89)&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no collective term for these beings either in Sumerian or Akkadian, they were merely described as harmful or dangerous beings or forces, and they were used as a logical way to explain the existence of evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:63)&lt;/ref&gt; They were thought to be countless in number, and were thought to even attack the gods as well. Besides demons, there were also spirits of the dead, (etimmu) who could also cause mischief. Amulets were occasionally used, and sometimes a special priest or exorcist ([[āšipu]] or mašmašu) was required. Incantations and ceremonies were also used to cure diseases which were also thought to be associated with demonic activity, sometimes making use of [[sympathetic magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 90–91)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes an attempt was made to capture a demon by making an image of it, placing it above the head of a sick person, then destroying the image, which the demon was somehow likely to inhabit. Images of protecting spirits were also made and placed at gates to ward off disaster.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974: 92-93"&gt;Ringgren (1974: 92–93)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Divination]] was also employed by private individuals, with the assumption that the gods have already determined the destinies of men and these destinies could be ascertained through observing omens and through rituals (e.g., casting lots).&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974: 92-93"/&gt; It was believed that the gods expressed their will through "words" (amatu) and "commandments" (qibitu) which were not necessarily spoken, but were thought to manifest in the unfolding routine of events and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:92)&lt;/ref&gt; There were countless ways to divine the future, such as observing oil dropped into a cup of water ([[lecanomancy]]), observing the entrails of sacrificial animals ([[extispicy]]), observation of the behavior of birds ([[augury]]) and observing celestial and meteorological phenomena ([[astrology]]), as well as through interpretation of dreams. Often interpretation of these phenomena required the need for two classes of priests: askers (sa'ilu) and observer ([[Bārû|baru]]), and also sometimes a lower class of ecstatic seer (mahhu) that was also associated with [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974: 93–95)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morality, virtue, and sin ==
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote="Do not return evil to the man who disputes with you, requite with kindness your evil-doer, maintain justice to your enemy... Let not your heart be induced to do evil... Give food to eat, beer to drink, the one begging for alms honor, clothe; in this a man's god takes pleasure, it is pleasing to Shamash, who will repay him with favour. Be helpful, do good"|source=Incantation from the ''[[Šurpu]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:113-115"&gt;Ringgren (1974:113–115)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although ancient [[paganism]] tended to focus more on duty and ritual than morality, a number of general moral virtues can be gleaned from surviving prayers and myths. It was believed that man originated as a divine act of creation, and the gods were believed to be the source of life, and held power over sickness and health, as well as the destinies of men. Personal names show that each child was considered a gift from divinity.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:108"&gt;Ringgren (1974:108)&lt;/ref&gt; Man was believed to have been created to serve the gods, or perhaps wait on them: the god is lord (''belu'') and man is servant or slave (''ardu''), and was to fear (''puluhtu'') the gods and have the appropriate attitude towards them. Duties seem to have been primarily of a cultic and ritual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:111–112)&lt;/ref&gt; although some prayers express a positive psychological relationship, or a sort of conversion experience in regard to a god.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:116"&gt;Ringgren (1974:116)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the reward to mankind is described as success and long life.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:108"/&gt;

Every man also had duties to his fellow man which had some religious character, particularly the king's duties to his subjects. It was thought that one of the reasons the gods gave power to the king was to exercise justice and righteousness,&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:110)&lt;/ref&gt; described as ''mēšaru'' and ''kettu'', literally "straightness, rightness, firmness, truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:112)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include not alienating and causing dissension between friends and relatives, setting innocent prisoners free, being truthful, being honest in trade, respecting boundary lines and property rights, and not putting on airs with subordinates. Some of these guidelines are found in the second tablet of the ''[[Šurpu]]'' incantation series.&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:113-115"/&gt;

Sin, on the other hand, was expressed by the words ''hitu'' (mistake, false step), ''annu'' or ''arnu'' (rebellion), and ''qillatu'' (sin or curse),&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:113-115"/&gt; with strong emphasis on the idea of rebellion, sometimes with the idea that sin is man's wishing to "live on his own terms" (ina ramanisu). Sin also was described as anything which incited the wrath of the gods. Punishment came through sickness or misfortune,&lt;ref name="Ringgren 1974:116"/&gt; which inevitably lead to the common reference to unknown sins, or the idea that one can transgress a divine prohibition without knowing it—psalms of lamentation rarely mention concrete sins. This idea of retribution was also applied to the nation and history as a whole. A number of examples of Mesopotamian literature show how war and natural disasters were treated as punishment from the gods, and how kings were used as a tool for deliverance.&lt;ref&gt;Ringgren (1974:118)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumerian myths suggest a prohibition against premarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;''Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece'' by Dale Launderville, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages were often arranged by the parents of the bride and groom; engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets. These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that premarital sex was a common, but surreptitious, occurrence.&lt;ref name=Kramer1963&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=The Univ. of Chicago Press|location=|isbn=0-226-45238-7|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} Outside Sumerian society, Mesopotamian religion and culture were highly sexualized, more so in Babylonia than Assyria, where free sexual expression was viewed as one of the natural benefits of civilized life—same gender attraction, transgender individuals, and male and female prostitution were tolerated, and in some cases considered [[sacred prostitution|sacred]]. The worship of Inanna/Ishtar, which was prevalent in Mesopotamia could involve wild, frenzied dancing and bloody ritual celebrations of social and physical abnormality. It was believed that "nothing is prohibited to Inanna", and that by depicting transgressions of normal human social and physical limitations, including traditional gender definition, one could cross over from the "conscious everyday world into the trance world of spiritual ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;Meador (2000:164)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Afterlife ==
The ancient Mesopotamians believed in an [[afterlife]] that was a land below our world. It was this land, known alternately as ''Arallû'', ''Ganzer'' or ''[[Irkalla|Irkallu]]'', the latter of which meant "Great Below", that it was believed everyone went to after death, irrespective of social status or the actions performed during life.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:108)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian Hell, the Mesopotamians considered the underworld neither a punishment nor a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choksi|first1=M.|title=Ancient Mesopotamian Beliefs in the Afterlife|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/article/701/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the condition of the dead was hardly considered the same as the life previously enjoyed on earth: they were considered merely weak and powerless ghosts. The myth of Ishtar's descent into the underworld relates that "dust is their food and clay their nourishment, they see no light, where they dwell in darkness." Stories such as the Adapa myth resignedly relate that, due to a blunder, all men must die and that true everlasting life is the sole property of the gods.&lt;ref name="Ringgren_a" /&gt;

== Eschatology ==
There are no known Mesopotamian tales about the [[End Time|end of the world]], although it has been speculated that they believed that this would eventually occur. This is largely because [[Berossus]] wrote that the Mesopotamians believed the world to last "twelve times twelve ''sars''"; with a ''sar'' being 3,600 years, this would indicate that at least some of the Mesopotamians believed that the Earth would only last 518,400 years. Berossus does not report what was thought to follow this event, however.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical study ==

=== Challenges ===
The modern study of Mesopotamia ([[Assyriology]]) is still a fairly young science, beginning only in the middle of the Nineteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Scheider (2011: 128)&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of Mesopotamian religion can be a complex and difficult subject because, by nature, their religion was governed only by usage, not by any official decision,&lt;ref&gt;Bottero (2001: 47)&lt;/ref&gt; and by nature it was neither dogmatic nor systematic. Deities, characters, and their actions within myths changed in character and importance over time, and occasionally depicted different, sometimes even contrasting images or concepts. This is further complicated by the fact that scholars are not entirely certain what role religious texts played in the Mesopotamian world.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider (2011:38–39)&lt;/ref&gt;

For many decades, some scholars of the Ancient Near East argued that it was impossible to define there as being a singular Mesopotamian religion, with Leo Oppenheim (1964) stating that "a systematic presentation of Mesopotamian religion cannot and should not be written. "&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:26)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Jean Bottéro]], the author of ''Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia'', disagreed, believing that it would be too complicated to divide the religion into many smaller groups, stating that:

: Should we dwell on a certain social or cultural category: the "official religion, " the "private religion, " the religion of the "educated"... Should we emphasise a certain city or province: [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], Assyria? Should we concentrate on a certain period in time: the [[Seleucid]], the [[Achaemenid]], the [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]], the [[Neo-Assyrian]], the [[Kassite]], the Old Babylonian, the Neo-Sumerian, or the Old Akkadian period? Since, contrary to what some would imprudently lead us to believe, there were no distinct religions but only successive states of the same religious system...&amp;nbsp;– such an approach would be excessive, even pointless.&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:27)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panbabylonism ===
{{Main|Panbabylonism}}
According to [[Panbabylonism]], a school of thought founded by [[Hugo Winckler]] and held in the early 20th century among primarily German Assyriologists, there was a common cultural system extending over the Ancient Near East which was overwhelmingly influenced by the Babylonians. According to this theory the religions of the Near East were rooted in Babylonian astral science- including the Hebrew Bible and Judaism. This theory of a Babylonian-derived Bible originated from the discovery of a stele in the acropolis of Susa bearing a Babylonian flood myth with many similarities to the flood of Genesis, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. However, [[flood myth]]s appear in almost every culture around the world, including cultures that never had contact with Mesopotamia. The fundamental tenets of Panbabylonism were eventually dismissed as pseudoscientific,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF-rCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Freudian Orient: Early Psychoanalysis, Anti-Semitic Challenge, and the Vicissitudes of Orientalist Discourse|first=Frank F.|last=Scherer|date=18 November 2017|publisher=Karnac Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Assyriologists and biblical scholars recognize the influence of Babylonian mythology on Jewish mythology and other Near Eastern mythologies, albeit indirect. Indeed, similarities between both religious traditions may draw from even older sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=R.

== Influence ==
=== Gnosticism ===

=== Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism ===
=== Biblical eschatology ===
In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], Babylonian religion is associated with religious apostasy of the lowest order, the archetype of a political/religious system heavily tied to global commerce, and it is depicted as a system which, according to the author, continued to hold sway in the first century CE, eventually to be utterly annihilated. According to some interpretations, this is believed to refer to the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keener |first=Craig S. |year=1993 |title=The IVP Bible Background Commentary, New Testament |publisher=Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, Illinois |page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to other interpretations, this system remains extant in the world until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Adam |title=Commentary and Critical Notes |volume= 3 |publisher=Abingdon Press |location=Nashville, Tennessee |page=1045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamieson |first=Rev.

For in one hour your judgment has come.' And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more..."

=== Popular culture ===
Mesopotamian religion, culture, history and mythology has influenced some forms of music. As well as traditional [[Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Syriac folk music]], many [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands have named themselves after Mesopotamian gods and historical figures, including the partly Assyrian band [[Melechesh]].

=== New religious movements ===
Various [[new religious movements]] in the 20th and 21st centuries have been founded that venerate some of the deities found in ancient Mesopotamian religion, including various strains of [[neopaganism]] that have adopted the worship of the historical Mesopotamian gods.

== Reconstruction ==
As with most dead religions, many aspects of the common practices and intricacies of the doctrine have been lost and forgotten over time. However, much of the information and knowledge has survived, and great work has been done by historians and scientists, with the help of religious scholars and translators, to re-construct a working knowledge of the religious history, customs, and the role these beliefs played in everyday life in Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylonia, Ebla and Chaldea during this time. Mesopotamian religion is thought to have been an influence on subsequent religions throughout the world, including [[ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]], [[Arameans#Religion and art|Aramean]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek]].

Mesopotamian religion was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshipping over 2,100 different deities,&lt;ref name="Bottéro 2001:45"&gt;Bottéro (2001:45)&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were associated with a specific state within Mesopotamia, such as Sumer, Akkad, Assyria or Babylonia, or a specific Mesopotamian city, such as;  ([[Ashur]]), [[Nineveh]], [[Ur]], [[Nippur]], [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Harran]], [[Uruk]], [[Ebla]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Eridu]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Sippar]], [[Gasur]], [[Ekallatum]], [[Til Barsip]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Babylon]].

Some of the most significant of these Mesopotamian deities were [[Anu]], [[Enki]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], [[Shamash]], [[Shulmanu]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Kur]], [[Dagon|Dagan]] ([[Dagon]]), [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], [[Tishpak]] and [[Marduk]].

Mesopotamian religion has historically the oldest body of recorded literature of any religious tradition. What is known about Mesopotamian religion comes from [[archaeology|archaeological evidence]] uncovered in the region, particularly numerous literary sources, which are usually written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Assyro-Babylonian]]) or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] using [[cuneiform script]] on clay tablets and which describe both mythology and [[cult (religious practice)|cultic]] practices. Other artifacts can also be useful when reconstructing Mesopotamian religion. As is common with most ancient civilizations, the objects made of the most durable and precious materials, and thus more likely to survive, were associated with religious beliefs and practices. This has prompted one scholar to make the claim that the Mesopotamian's "entire existence was infused by their religiosity, just about everything they have passed on to us can be used as a source of knowledge about their religion."&lt;ref&gt;Bottéro (2001:21–22)&lt;/ref&gt; While Mesopotamian religion had almost completely died out by approximately 400–500 CE after its indigenous adherents had largely become [[Assyrian Christians]], it has still had an influence on the modern world, predominantly because many biblical stories that are today found in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Mandaeism]] were possibly based upon earlier Mesopotamian myths, in particular that of the [[creation myth]], the [[Garden of Eden]], the [[flood myth]], the [[Tower of Babel]], figures such as [[Nimrod]] and [[Lilith]] and the [[Book of Esther]]. It has also inspired various contemporary [[neo-pagan]] groups.

== Fringe theories ==
The unusual and apparently physical closeness of gods to men in these stories has prompted various speculations including [[Julian Jaynes]]'s theory of the [[bicameral mind]] and [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s [[ancient astronauts]] theory. While rejected in scholarship, such speculations have influenced many science fiction stories and movies.

An '''annual cycle''' refers to a set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.

In [[biology]], the annual cycle for plants and animals details behavioral and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, John M. and Houston, Alasdair I. (2008) "Introduction: Adaptation to the annual cycle" ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 363(1490):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a [[business cycle]] refers to the way modelling and analysis is applied to the periodic development and marketing of new products and services.

In [[religion]], the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, in [[Christianity]] the [[liturgical year]] is an annual cycle, which for some [[Christian denomination]]s is composed of the ''temporal cycle'' that tracks the events in the life of [[Christ]], and the ''sanctoral cycle'' which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the ''temporal cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;Flesher, Paul [http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm "Christian Time and Worship"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309191604/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }} ''Exploring Religions'' University of Wyoming&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in [[orbit]] over the course of the year.  Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming [[solar radiation]] at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[westerlies]] and [[polar easterlies|easterlies]] over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.

Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an [[anomaly time series]].

The '''axis mundi''' (also '''cosmic axis''', '''world axis''', '''world pillar''', '''center of the world''', '''world tree'''), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the connection between [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]]. As the [[celestial pole]] and [[geographic pole]], it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.40&lt;/ref&gt; The spot functions as the ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel), the world's point of beginning.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Cooper. ''An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols.'' Thames and Hudson: New York, 1978. {{ISBN|0500271259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winther, Rasmus Grønfeldt (2014) World Navels. ''Cartouche'' 89: 15-21 http://philpapers.org/archive/WINWN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The image relates to the center of the earth (perhaps like an [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] providing nourishment){{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It may have the form of a natural object (a [[mountain]], a [[tree]], a [[vine]], a [[Plant stem|stalk]], a column of [[smoke]] or [[fire]]) or a product of human manufacture (a staff, a [[tower]], a [[ladder]], a [[staircase]], a [[maypole]], a [[cross]], a [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a [[rope]], a [[totem pole]], a [[Column|pillar]], a [[spire]]). Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious ([[pagoda]], [[temple mount]], [[minaret]], [[church (building)|church]]) or secular ([[obelisk]], [[lighthouse]], [[rocket]], [[skyscraper]]). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"&gt;[[Jean Chevalier (writer)|Jean Chevalier]] and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.61-63, 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; The ''axis mundi'' symbol may be found in cultures utilizing [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices or [[animism|animist]] belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced "urban centers". In [[Mircea Eliade]]'s opinion, "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The axis mundi is often associated with [[mandalas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]]]]
The symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the spot one occupies stands at "the center of the world". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.37-39&lt;/ref&gt; From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of [[China]], meaning "Middle Nation" ({{lang|zh|中国}} [[pinyin]]: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}''), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"/&gt;

Within the central known universe a specific locale-often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest gains status as center of the center, the '''axis mundi'''. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.41-43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] fills a similar role in China.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chong. ''Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung''. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1907. p.337.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Hebrews [[Mount Zion]] expressed the symbol.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Sioux]] beliefs take the [[Black Hills]] as the axis mundi.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Mount Kailash]] is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]]. The [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people in central Australia consider [[Uluru]] to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuacán]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York (NY)|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob's Ladder]] is an axis mundi image, as is the [[Temple Mount]]. For Christians the [[Cross]] on Mount [[Calvary]] expresses the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.680-685&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]], known in [[Taoism|Taoist literature]] as "the mountain at the middle of the world." To "go into the mountains" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.681&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries of all faiths tend, like shrines, to be placed at elevated spots. Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.

Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as "the center of the world". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13103-3|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urartu|ancient Armenians]] had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was [[Mount Ararat]], which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peopleofar.com/2013/08/11/noahs-ark-in-the-mountains-of-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.

Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the [[Cosmic Tree]] provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.42-45&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Pacific island]] cultures the [[banyan]] tree, of which the [[Bodhi tree]] is of the [[Sacred Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ''ashwath vriksha'' ("I am banyan tree among trees" - ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. The [[Yggdrasil]], or World Ash, functions in much the same way in [[Norse mythology]]; it is the site where [[Odin]] found enlightenment. Other examples include [[Jievaras]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Thor's Oak]] in the myths of the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The [[Tree of Life]] and the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the [[Garden of Eden|Paradise garden]] from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. [[Bamboo]], the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The [[Christmas tree]], which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian [[Europe]]an beliefs, represents an axis mundi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain.

Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.1025-1033&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify span|[[Entheogen]]s (psychoactive substances) are often{{who|date=November 2012}} regarded as world axes|date=November 2012}}, such as the [[Fly Agaric]] mushroom among the [[Evenks]] of [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree ({{lang|zh|建木}}). Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the ''[[Huainanzi]]''. The [[Mesoamerican world tree]] connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary  |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]]  |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=186|isbn=0500050686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1492)]]

===Human figure===
The human body can express the symbol of world axis.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the ''[[sefirot]]'' in [[Kabbalism]] and in the ''[[chakra]]'' system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as [[yoga]] and [[tai chi]] begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. [[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Homes===
Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"/&gt; The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that "the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky."&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.529-531&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caduceus large.jpg|thumb|110px|right|The [[caduceus]]]]

===Shamanic function===
A common [[shamanism|shamanic]] concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from [[Odin]] and the [[Yggdrasil|World Ash Tree]] to [[the Garden of Eden]] and [[Jacob's Ladder]] to [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and [[Rapunzel]]. It is the essence of the journey described in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]]. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.
It is also a central tenet in the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, [[mistletoe]]. Derivations of this idea find form in the [[Rod of Asclepius]], an emblem of the medical profession, and in the [[caduceus]], an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Synthesis|date=November 2008}}
Axis mundi symbolism continues to be evoked, even in modern societies, through various art forms and has a deep rooted spiritual inspiration that transcends time.

The idea has proven consequential in the realm of [[architecture]].  Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as "centers" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The column takes the form of a "sky pillar" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.&lt;ref&gt; Jennifer Westjohn. Photographer. "jenniferwestjohn.com" "the5thpoint.com" 2013-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Axis mundi symbolism exists in modern [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. &lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp. 18, 1020-1022&lt;/ref&gt; Each astronaut embarks on a perilous journey into the heavens, per se, and if successful, returns with a boon for dissemination. The [[Apollo 13]] insignia stated it succinctly: ''Ex luna scientia'' ("From the Moon, knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-13/apollo-13.html Nasa Apollo Mission: Apollo 13. 2007-08-25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi.

'''Divine apathy''' is the doctrine that the divine nature is incapable of suffering, passivity or modification. This doctrine is a common feature of [[Platonism|Platonist]], [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]], and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophical theology]] and seems to have heavily influenced post-Biblical Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thought.  On the other hand, the Bible depicts YHWH as capable of grieving, for example:

"And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart." (Genesis 6:6 King James Version)

"And then יהוה sighed as He has effectuated the ʔǟḏǟ̖m in the land, and then He travailed (Himself) to His heart." (Genesis 6:6 Scriptures of the Faith Once Delivered)

==In contrast to folk religion==
Elite religion is often contrasted with [[folk religion]], or the religious symbols and beliefs of the masses. Elite religion is then the "official religion" as championed by the leaders of a religion.

==Strengthening denominationalism==
Sociologist [[Charles Liebman]] theorized that the strengthening of elite religion over members of a particular group led to the growth of [[denominationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles. ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. (1973): 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent.

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''. Stanford, CA: [[Stanford University Press]]. {{ISBN|1-55786-857-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery (1948) ''Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam''. London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====
{{Main|Predeterminism}}
{{See also|Predestination}}

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====

{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas.

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Free Will: Essential Readings from the Contemporary Debates |author1=Paul Russell |author2=Oisin Deery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLyi7nmzr28C&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=I. The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623–42 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity. The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.''

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson.

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 13–16 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

(2008). ''Belief in free will supports guilt over personal misdeeds''. Unpublished findings. Tallahassee, FL: Florida State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Roese. 2008. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Personality and Social Psychology 12: 168–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

Along similar lines, Tyler Stillman has found that belief in free will predicts better job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/1948550609351600| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 43–50| last = Stillman| first = Tyler F.|author2=Roy F.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St.-Jerome-In-His-Study.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[St. Jerome]], who lived as a hermit near [[Bethlehem]], depicted in his study being visited by two angels ''([[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi|Cavarozzi]], early 17th century)''.]]
A '''hermit''' ([[adjectival form]]: '''eremitic''' or '''hermitic''') is a person who lives in [[seclusion]] from society, usually for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hermit|title=hermit definition - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hermit|title=hermit Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/hermit|title=hermit - meaning of hermit in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - LDOCE|website=www.ldoceonline.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermits are a part of several sects of Christianity, and the concept is found in other religions as well.

==Description==
In [[Christianity]], the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the eremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|Desert Theology]] of the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the desert that was meant to bring about a change of heart).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In the Christian tradition the eremitic life&lt;ref&gt;Marina Miladinov, ''Margins of Solitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West'' (Zaghreb: Leykam International, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is an early form of [[Monk|monastic living]] that preceded the monastic life in the [[cenobium]]. The [[Rule of St Benedict]] (ch. 1) lists hermits among four kinds of [[monk]]s. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], in addition to hermits who are members of [[religious institute]]s, the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] (canon 603) recognizes also [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|diocesan hermits]] under the direction of their [[diocesan bishop|bishop]] as members of the [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|consecrated life]]. The same is true in many parts of the [[Anglican Communion]], including the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the US, although in the canon law of the Episcopal Church they are referred to as "solitaries" rather than "hermits".

Often, both in religious and secular literature, the term "hermit" is also used loosely for any Christian living a [[wikt:secluded|secluded]] prayer-focused life, and sometimes interchangeably with [[anchorite|anchorite/anchoress]], [[recluse]] and "solitary". Other religions, for example, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] ([[Sufism]]), and [[Taoism]], also have hermits in the sense of individuals living an ascetic form of life.

In modern colloquial usage, "hermit" denotes anyone living apart from the rest of society, or simply participating in fewer social events, for any reason.

==Etymology==
The word ''hermit'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''ĕrēmīta'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deremita eremita], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐρημίτης (''erēmitēs''), "of the desert",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29rhmi%2Fths ἐρημίτης],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from ἔρημος (''erēmos''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29rh%3Dmos ἔρημος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; signifying "desert", "uninhabited", hence "desert-dweller"; adjective: "eremitic".

==History==

===Tradition===
In the common Christian tradition the first known Christian hermit in Egypt was [[Paul of Thebes]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 3rd century), hence also called "St. Paul the first hermit". His disciple [[Antony of Egypt]] (fl. 4th century), often referred to as "Antony the Great", is perhaps the most renowned of all the very early Christian hermits owing to the biography by his friend [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. An antecedent for [[Egypt]]ian eremiticism may have been the [[Syrian]] solitary or "son of the covenant" ([[Aramaic]] ''bar qəyāmā'') who undertook special disciplines as a [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003094121/http://www.monachos.net/monasticism/monastic_beginnings.shtml|title=The Origins and Motivations of Monasticism|date=3 October 2002|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]] some [[Carmelite]] hermits claimed to trace their origin to [[Jewish]] hermits organized by [[Elijah]].

[[Christian]] hermits in the past have often lived in isolated [[Monastic cell|cells]] or [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]], whether a natural [[cave]] or a constructed dwelling, situated in the [[desert]] or the [[forest]]. People sometimes sought them out for spiritual advice and counsel. Some eventually acquired so many [[Apprenticeship|disciples]] that they no longer had physical solitude.

The early Christian [[Desert Father]]s wove baskets to exchange for bread. In [[medieval]] times hermits were also found within or near cities where they might earn a living as a gate keeper or ferryman.

From the [[Middle Ages]] and down to modern times eremitical monasticism has also been practiced within the context of religious institutes in the [[Christian]] West. For example, in the [[Catholic Church]] the [[Carthusians]] and [[Camaldolese]] arrange their monasteries as clusters of hermitages where the monks live most of their day and most of their lives in solitary prayer and work, gathering only relatively briefly for communal prayer and only occasionally for community meals and recreation. The [[Cistercian]], [[Trappist]] and [[Carmelite]] orders, which are essentially communal in nature, allow members who feel a [[Vocation|calling]] to the eremitic life, after years living in the [[cenobium]] or community of the monastery, to move to a cell suitable as a hermitage on monastery grounds. This applies to both their [[monk]]s and their [[nun]]s. There have also been many hermits who chose that vocation as an alternative to other forms of monastic life. In the 11th century, the life of the hermit gained recognition as a legitimate independent pathway to salvation. Many hermits in that century and the next came to be regarded as [[saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Licence, ''Hermits and Recluses in English Society 950–1200'', (Oxford, 2011),p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchorites===
{{Main article|Anchorite}}
The term "anchorite" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀναχωρέω}} ''anachōreō'', signifying "to withdraw", "to depart into the country outside the circumvallate city") is often used as a [[synonym]] for hermit, not only in the earliest written sources but throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. "A person who has withdrawn or secluded themself from the world; usually one who has done so for religious reasons, a recluse, a hermit."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the anchoritic life, while similar to the eremitic life, can also be distinct from it. [[Anchorite]]s lived the religious life in the solitude of an "anchorhold" (or "anchorage"), usually a small hut or "cell", typically built against a church.&lt;ref&gt;McAvoy, LA., ''Anchoritic Traditions of Medieval Europe'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 2.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceU1Wa_2VZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=anchorite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6p6iU5m6CYvX7Aa4lIDIAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=cell&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The door of an anchorage tended to be bricked up in a special ceremony conducted by the local [[bishop]] after the anchorite had moved in. Medieval churches survive that have a tiny window ("squint") built into the shared wall near the [[Sanctuary#Altar|sanctuary]] to allow the anchorite to participate in the [[liturgy]] by listening to the service and to receive [[Holy Communion]]. Another window looked out into the street or cemetery, enabling charitable neighbors to deliver food and other necessities. Clients seeking the anchorite's advice might also use this window to consult them.&lt;ref&gt;Dyas, E., Edden, V. and Ellis, R., ''Approaching Medieval English Anchoritic and Mystical Texts'', DS Brewer, 2005, p. 10-12.[https://books.google.com/books?id=aPmVPjBu3nsC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=anchorite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6p6iU5m6CYvX7Aa4lIDIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cell&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Christian life==

===Catholic Church===
Catholics who wish to live in eremitic monasticism may live that [[vocation]] as a hermit:
* in an eremitical order (for example [[Carthusian]], [[Camaldolese]]), but in both cases under obedience to their religious superior (see below), or as an [[Oblate]] affiliated with the [[Camaldolese]] or
* as a diocesan hermit under the canonical direction of their [[Diocesan bishop|bishop]] (canon 603, see below).
There are also lay people who informally follow an eremitic lifestyle and live mostly as solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dubay, T., ''And You Are Christ's: The Charism of Virginity and the Celibate Life'', Ignatius Press, 1987, Ch. 9.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZC13EV785MsC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=eremitic+catholic+canon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tOCiU4zELa7B7AaI_ID4Aw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eremitic members of religious institutes====
[[File:Kerkzomerpiep.jpg|thumb|Church of the hermitage "[[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden]]" in [[Warfhuizen]], [[Netherlands]]]]

In the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] have their own regulations concerning those of their members who feel called by God to move from the [[Cenobium|life in community]] to the eremitic life, and have the permission of their religious superior to do so. The [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law (1983)]] contains no special provisions for them. They technically remain a member of their [[institute of consecrated life]] and thus under obedience to their religious superior.

The [[Carthusian]] and [[Camaldolese]] orders of monks and nuns preserve their original way of life as essentially eremitical within a cenobitical context, that is, the monasteries of these orders are in fact clusters of individual hermitages where monks and nuns spend their days alone with relatively short periods of prayer in common.

Other orders that are essentially cenobitical, notably the [[Trappists]], maintain a tradition under which individual monks or nuns who have reached a certain level of maturity within the community may pursue a hermit lifestyle on monastery grounds under the supervision of the abbot or abbess. [[Thomas Merton]] was among the Trappists who undertook this way of life.

====Diocesan hermits (canon 603)====
The earliest form of Christian eremitic or anchoritic living preceded that as a member of a religious institute, since [[cenobium|monastic communities]] and religious institutes are later developments of the [[Monk|monastic life]]. Today an increasing number of Christian faithful feel again a [[vocation]] to live the eremitic life, whether in the remote countryside or in a city in stricter separation from the world, without having passed through [[cenobium|life in a monastic community]] first. Bearing in mind that the meaning of the eremitic vocation is the [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|Desert Theology]] of the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the [[Zin Desert|desert]] that was meant to bring about a change of heart), it may be said that the desert of the [[Urban area|urban]] hermit is that of their heart, purged through [[kenosis]] to be the dwelling place of God alone.

So as to provide for men and women who feel a [[vocation|calling]] to the eremitic or anchoritic life without being or becoming a member of an [[Institute of Consecrated Life|institute of consecrated life]], but desire its recognition by the Roman Catholic Church as a form of [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|consecrated life]] nonetheless, the [[Code of Canon Law]] '''1983''' legislates in the Section on Consecrated Life (canon 603) as follows:

{{quote|§1 Besides [[Institute of Consecrated Life|institutes of consecrated life]] the church recognizes the eremitic or anchoritic life by which the Christian faithful devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance.

§2 A hermit is recognized by law as one dedicated to God in consecrated life if he or she publicly professes in the hands of the diocesan bishop the three evangelical counsels, confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, and observes a proper program of living under his direction.}}

Canon 603 §2 therefore lays down certain requirements for those who feel a [[vocation]] to the kind of eremitic life that is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as one of the "other forms of consecrated life". They usually are referred to as "diocesan hermits".

The norms of canon 603 do not apply to the many other Catholic faithful who live alone and devote themselves to fervent prayer for the love of God without however feeling [[vocation|called by God]] to seek recognition of their prayerful solitary life from the Roman Catholic Church by entering the [[consecrated life]].

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] of 11 October '''1992''' (§§918–921) comments on the eremitic life as follows:

{{quote|From the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practicing the [[evangelical counsels]]. They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]], became hermits or founded religious families. These the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted and approved.

Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of consecrated life is reserved to the [[Apostolic See]]. (Footnote: Cf. CIC, can. 605).
...
Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly, hermits "devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance". (Footnote: CIC, can. 603 §1)

They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the Church, that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him. Here is a particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual battle, the glory of the Crucified One.}}

[[Catholic Church]] norms for the consecrated eremitic and [[Anchorite|anchoritic]] life (cf. canon 603) do not include [[Charity (virtue)|corporal works of mercy]]. Nevertheless, every hermit, like every Christian, is bound by the law of charity and therefore ought to respond generously, as his or her own circumstances permit, when faced with a specific need for [[Charity (virtue)|corporal works of mercy]]. Hermits, like every Christian, are also bound by the law of work. If they are not financially independent, they may engage in cottage industries or be employed part-time in jobs that respect the call for them to live in solitude and silence with extremely limited or no contact with other persons. Such outside jobs may not keep them from observing their obligations of the eremitic vocation of stricter separation from the world and the silence of solitude in accordance with canon 603, under which they have made their [[Religious vows|vow]].

Although canon 603 makes no provision for associations of hermits, these do exist (for example the "Hermits of Bethlehem" in Chester NJ and the "Hermits of Saint Bruno" in the US; see also [[lavra]], [[skete]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Bamberg Anne, ''Ermite reconnu par l’Église. Le c. 603 du code de droit canonique et la haute responsabilité de l’évêque diocésain'', in ''Vie consacrée'', 74, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;104–118 and ''Entre théologie et droit canonique : l’ermite catholique face à l’obéissance'', in ''Nouvelle revue théologique'', 125, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;429–439 or ''Eremiten und geweihtes Leben. Zur kanonischen Typologie'', in ''Geist und Leben'', 78, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;313–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Poustiniks ====
Not all the Catholic lay members that feel that it is their [[vocation]] to dedicate themselves to God in a prayerful solitary life perceive it as a vocation to some form of consecrated life. An example of this is life as a [[Poustinia#Poustinik|Poustinik]], an Eastern Catholic expression of eremitic living that is finding adherents also in the West.

===Anglican Communion===
Many of the recognised religious communities and orders in the [[Anglican Communion]] make provision for certain members to live as hermits, more commonly referred to as solitaries. One [[Church of England]] community, the [[Society of St. John the Evangelist]], now has only solitaries in its British congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fsje.org.uk/fsj.html |title=Society of St John the Evangelist |publisher= Fellowship of St John Trust Association |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglicanism also makes provision for men and women who seek to live a single consecrated life, after taking vows before their local bishop; many who do so live as solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.singleconsecratedlife-anglican.org.uk/solitaries.php |title = Solitaries who are not members of a Religious community |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Single Consecrated Life |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 1 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Handbook of Religious Life, published by the Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities (ACRBRC), contains an appendix governing the selection, consecration, and management of solitaries living outside recognised religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Religious Life |first= |last= Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities|edition= Fifth (revised) |chapter=  |volume= |location= London|publisher= Canterbury Press|publication-date= 2012|page= 194|isbn= 9781853116186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Canon Law of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], those who make application to their diocesan bishop and who persevere in whatever preparatory program the bishop requires, take vows that include lifelong celibacy. They are referred to as solitaries rather than hermits. Each selects a bishop other than their diocesan as an additional spiritual resource and, if necessary, an intermediary.

At the start of the twenty-first century the Church of England reported a notable increase in the number of applications from people seeking to live the single consecrated life as Anglican hermits or solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/08/religion.world |title = Britain's growing band of religious hermits |last= |first= |author= |publisher = The Guardian |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 1 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|St. [[Seraphim of Sarov]] sharing his meal with a bear]]

===Eastern Christianity===
In the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Church]]es, hermits live a life not only of prayer but also of service to their community in the traditional [[Eastern Christian]] manner of the [[poustinia|poustinik]]. The poustinik is a hermit available to all in need and at all times.

In the Eastern Christian churches one traditional variation of the Christian eremitic life is the semi-eremitic life in a [[lavra]] or [[skete]], exemplified historically in [[Scetes]], a place in the Egyptian desert, and continued in various sketes today including several regions on [[Mount Athos]].

==Other religions==

[[File:Sadu Kathmandu Pashupatinath 2006 Luca Galuzzi.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Sadhu]]s, Hindu hermits]]

From a [[religion|religious]] point of view, the solitary life is a form of [[asceticism]], wherein the hermit renounces worldly concerns and pleasures. This can be done for many reasons, including: to come closer to the [[deity|deity or deities]] they worship or revere, to devote one's energies to self-liberation from [[saṃsāra]], etc. This practice appears also in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]]. [[Taoism]] also has a long history of ascetic and eremitical figures. In the ascetic eremitic life, the hermit seeks solitude for [[meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[prayer]], self-awareness and personal development on physical and mental levels; without the distractions of contact with human society, [[sex]], or the need to maintain socially acceptable standards of [[cleanliness]], [[clothing|dress]] or communication. The ascetic [[discipline]] can also include a simplified [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and/or [[manual labour|manual labor]] as a means of support.{{clear left}}

* Rabbi [[Nachman of Bratzlav]], the Baal Shem Tov's great-grandson, also spent much time in seclusion and instructed his disciples to set aside at least one hour a day for secluded contemplation and prayer. Some followers of Rabbi Nachman devoted themselves to seclusion, such as Rabbi Shmuel of Dashev and two generations later, Rabbi [[Abraham Chazan]].
* Rabbi [[Yosef Yozel Horowitz]], known as the "Alter (Elder) of Novardok", succeeded his master Rabbi [[Yisrael Salanter]] in disseminating the pietistic teachings of the Lithuanian [[Mussar Movement]]. He too spent much time in seclusion, included one year during which he confined himself to a sealed room, attended by a few devoted followers.

* In medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], the [[knight-errant]] frequently encounters hermits on his [[quest]]. Such a figure, generally a [[wise old man]], would advise him. Knights searching for the [[Holy Grail]], in particular, learn from a hermit the errors they must repent for, and the significance of their encounters, dreams, and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', pp. 179–81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would sometimes pose as hermits, to explain their presence in the wilds, and to lure heroes into a false sense of security. In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', both occurred: the knight on a quest met a good hermit, and the sorcerer [[Archimago]] took on such a pose.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|Lewis, C. S.]], ''Spenser's Images of Life'', p. 87, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; These hermits are sometimes also vegetarians for ascetic reasons, as suggested in a passage from [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur|Le Morte d'Arthur]]'': "Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And when they were (had) come up, they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little courtelage (courtyard), where Nacien the hermit gathered worts (vegetables), as he had tasted none other meat (food) of a great while."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' 16.3&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of vegetarianism may have also existed amongst actual medieval hermits outside of literature.
* Hermits can appear in [[fairy tale]]s in the character of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]], as in ''[[Făt-Frumos with the Golden Hair]]''.
* Hermits appear in a few of the stories of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''. One of the most famous stories, the tenth story of the third day, involves the seduction of a young girl by a hermit in the desert near [[Gafsa]]; it was judged to be so obscene that it was not translated into English until the 20th century.
* The main character of [[Tolstoy]]'s short story "[[Father Sergius]]" is a Russian nobleman who turns to a solitary religious life and becomes a hermit after he learns that his fiancee was a discarded mistress of the [[czar]].
* English musician [[John Renbourn]] released an album and song titled ''The Hermit''. The album cover shows a man similar to the images printed on [[Tarot]] decks.
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his influential work ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', created the character of the hermit Zarathustra (named after the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[prophet]] [[Zoroaster|Zarathushtra]]), who emerges from seclusion to extol his philosophy to the rest of humanity.
* In the late 18th century, some English noblemen would have "[[ornamental hermit]]s" living on their land, for instance in a [[folly]]. The hermit would be paid, provided with food and water, and given a skull, a book and an hourglass.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aV1x0rMca4QC&amp;dq=ornamental+hermits&amp;q=%22skull%2C+the+emblem%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22skull%2C%20the%20emblem%22&amp;f=false ''The Hermit in the Garden: From Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome''], Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these ornamental hermits did not talk to the servants, but simply repeated a phrase in Latin. Most grew beards and did not cut their nails. Notable places with ornamental hermits included [[Painshill]] and [[Hawkstone Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringing Church Bells to ward off Thunderstorms, 2009. 978-0956204608&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] is first introduced to the audience as an old hermit, seen by most of the characters as a very dangerous, wizard. Later, the story reveals that his first name is Obi-Wan, and that he  went into exile for political reasons, though it also provided spiritual training, since he was a warrior monk in his youth. The story also portrays [[Yoda]], another [[Jedi]], as a wizard or hermit. The seventh installment of the series, ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', reveals that [[Luke Skywalker]] also went into exile to live as a hermit.
* In the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series, the character [[Jason Voorhees]] was believed to have died after he drowned as a child. However, this later changed when it turned out that he survived and lived life as a hermit—only to enter a murderous rage when he witnesses the death of his mother seemingly years later (which was during the events of the original film).
* In the [[anime]] ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'', a martial-arts master named [[Muten Roshi]] is often referred to as a Turtle Hermit, despite the fact that over the course of the series characters are often visiting or even living in his island home.
* [[Monty Python]] performed a sketch about two hermits, who agree at the beginning, "There's no point frigging your life in idleness and trivial chit-chats," but the conversation quickly degenerate into gossip about their hermit neighbors and their caves, as if it were ordinary suburban gossip. It ends with one character saying, "It's still better being a hermit, at least you meet people," and the other responding, "Oh yes, I wouldn't go back to public relations."
* The primary antagonist of ''[[Yogi's First Christmas]]'' is a character by the name of Herman the Hermit. He is a solitary, misanthropic individual who hates Christmas, and who "only wants to be left alone."
* Along the southern rim of the [[Grand Canyon]] there is a popular location known as [[Hermit's Rest]], at the end of [[Hermit Road (Arizona)|Hermit Road]]. The location was named for [[Louis Boucher]]. Around 1891, Boucher, a Canadian-born prospector, staked claims below present-day Hermit's Rest. With help, Boucher carved a trail into the canyon and for years lived alone at nearby [[Dripping Springs, Grand Canyon|Dripping Springs]]. He has been described as a kind, gentle soul. Though not a true hermit, Boucher is the "hermit" for whom local features around the southern rim are named.
* In the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', John Black's long lost father, Yo Ling, lives in seclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31094">The '''knight of faith''' is an individual who has placed complete [[faith]] in himself and in God and can act freely and independently from the world. The 19th-century Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] vicariously discusses the knight of faith in several of his pseudonymic works, with the most in-depth and detailed critique exposited in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and in ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''.

==Overview==
Johannes de Silentio, Kierkegaard's pseudonymous author of ''Fear and Trembling'', argues that the knight of faith is the paradox, is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections or pretensions.  The ''knight of faith'' is the individual who is able to gracefully embrace life: Kierkegaard put it this way in  ''Either/Or'', "When around one everything has become silent, solemn as a clear, starlit night, when the soul comes to be alone in the whole world, then before one there appears, not an extraordinary human being, but the eternal power itself, then the heavens open, and the I chooses itself or, more correctly, receives itself. Then the [[Personality psychology|personality]] receives the accolade of knighthood that ennobles it for an eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or part II p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; "The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien."&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, Hong p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox |Most people live dejectedly in worldly sorrow and joy; they are the ones who sit along the wall and do not join in the dance. The knights of infinity are dancers and possess elevation. They make the movements upward, and fall down again; and this too is no mean pastime, nor ungraceful to behold. But whenever they fall down they are not able at once to assume the posture, they vacillate an instant, and this vacillation shows that after all they are strangers in the world. This is more or less strikingly evident in proportion to the art they possess, but even the most artistic knights cannot altogether conceal this vacillation. One need not look at them when they are up in the air, but only the instant they touch or have touched the ground–then one recognizes them. But to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime in the pedestrian–that only the knight of faith can do–and this is the one and only prodigy.|Johannes de Silentio|Fear and Trembling, 1843| width  = 33%| align  = right

== The three stages ==
{{Further information|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life {{!}} The Three Stages}}
Kierkegaard recognized three levels of individual existence: The Aesthetic, The Ethical, and The Religious.  In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Silentio refers to individuals in each stage as the personal self, the civic self, and the religious self.  Each of these levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical or religious person can still enjoy life aesthetically. Abraham learned how to keep his finite relationship with his family separate from his infinite relationship with God. He had to overcome the fear of having anxiety over losing something. Each individual experiences anxiety to a different degree and the fear of anxiety in a unique way.

== Knight of faith and the knight of infinite resignation ==
Kierkegaard's Silentio contrasts the knight of faith with the other two, knight of infinite resignation and the aesthetic realm's "slaves."  Kierkegaard uses the story of a princess and a man who is madly in love with her, but circumstances are that the man will never be able to realize this love in this world.  A person who is in the aesthetic stage would abandon this love, crying out for example, "Such a love is foolishness. The rich brewer's widow is a match fully as good and respectable."  A person who is in the ethical stage would not give up on this love, but would be resigned to the fact that they will never be together in this world.  The knight of infinite resignation may or may not believe that they may be together in another life or in spirit, but what's important is that the knight of infinite resignation gives up on their being together ''in this world; in this life.''

The knight of faith feels what the knight of infinite resignation feels, but with exception that the knight of faith believes that ''in this world; in this life'', they will be together.  The knight of faith would say "I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, in virtue, that is, of the absurd, in virtue of the fact that with God all things are possible."  This double movement is paradoxical because on the one hand it is humanly impossible that they would be together, but on the other hand the knight of faith is willing to believe that they will be together through divine possibility.

== Abraham and Isaac ==
[[File:Anthony van Dyck - Abraham and Isaac - WGA07427.jpg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Abraham and Isaac|Abraham and Isaac by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]Johannes de Silentio believes that [[Abraham]] is one such knight of faith.  In the [[Book of Genesis]], God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham dearly loved his son, but although bemoaning this fate, Abraham obeyed this command faithfully.  Just as he was about to commit the act, an angel stopped Abraham and rewarded him with his son and his steadfast faith.  In the same paradoxical act of committing murder, which would humanly kill off his son, Abraham believed, through virtue of the absurd, he would still have his son alive and well. Abraham was willing to risk everything for God. He was willing to act and in his action he received the highest good, his eternal happiness.

But "how" did Abraham act? He walked for 3 days step by step trusting in God. That is an example of keeping expectancy alive when any ethicist would say it should have died before he left home. What would have happened to his expectancy had he told Sarah? Or Isaac? He would have to explain himself but he couldn't. So he ventured for the truth of what he understood as the highest good. He kept his resolution intact. {{Quotation|To have faith in God-does that mean to think about how glorious it must be to have faith, to think about what peace and security faith can give? Not at all. Even to wish, where the interest, the subject’s interest, is far more evident, is not to have faith, is not to act. The individual’s relation to the thought-action is still continually only a possibility that he can give up. It is not denied that with regard to evil there are cases in which the transition is almost undetectable, but these cases must be explained in a special way. This is due to the fact that the individual is so in the power of habit that by frequently having made the transition from thinking to acting he has finally lost the power for it in the bondage of habit, which at his expense makes it faster and faster. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 339-340}} {{Quotation|If I, acting, am truly to venture and truly to aspire to the highest good, then there must be uncertainty and, if I may put it this way, I must have room to move. But the greatest space in which I can move, where there is space enough for the most rigorous gesture of infinite passion, is uncertainty of knowledge with regard to an eternal happiness, or that choosing it is lunacy in the finite sense-see, now there is room, now you can venture. Therefore eternal happiness, as the absolute good, has the remarkable quality that it can be defined only by the mode in which it is acquired, whereas other good, just because of the mode of acquisition is accidental or at any rate relatively dialectical, must be defined by the good itself. Money, for example, can be acquired by work and can also be obtained without work, and in turn both are different in many ways, but money still remains the same good. Knowledge, for example, is acquired differently according to talent and outward circumstances and therefore cannot be defined by the mode of acquisition. But nothing else can be said of eternal happiness than that it is the good that is attained by absolutely venturing everything. Any description of the gloriousness of this good is already an attempt, as it were, to make various modes of acquisition possible-an easier way, for example, and a harder way, which shows that the description is not describing the absolute good but only fancies doing it and essentially is talking about relative goods. Venture everything. There are no [[anecdotes]] to tell how [[Saint Peter|Peter]] became rich by working, and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] by playing the lottery, and Hans by inheritance, and Matthew by monetary reform, and Christopher by purchasing a piece of furniture from a secondhand dealer. But in another sense the [[discourse]] is long, indeed, the longest of all discourses, because to [[Risk|venture]] everything demands a [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparency]] of [[consciousness]] that is acquired only very slowly. Right here is the task of the religious discourse. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 426-427}}

== Who are knights of faith? ==
[[File:Jan Janssens - The Annunciation - WGA11940.jpg|left|thumb|200px|alt=The Annunciation|The Annunciation, by [[Jan Janssens]]]]Silentio personally believes that only two people were ever knights of faith: The [[Virgin Mary]], and Abraham.  It is also possible that Silentio regards [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] as a knight of faith.  Silentio grants that there may be knights of faith out there that we do not know about, or that there never have been knights of faith. This is because knights of faith exist alone in isolation. Yet Kierkegaard said the following in ''Repetition''. "The Young Man has gone through the same ordeal as Job but neither of them is a Knight of Faith."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Repetition'' p. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham wasn't really alone and living in isolation, he was only alone for three anxious filled days,&lt;ref&gt;Fear and Trembling, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; he was a married man who had a wife and children and God had promised him many more. Mary was alone with the angel for a short time but then she was a wife and later a mother. &lt;blockquote&gt;To be sure, Mary bore the child wondrously, but she nevertheless did it “after the manner of women,” and such a time is one of [[anxiety]], distress and [[paradox]]. The angel was indeed a ministering spirit, but he was not a meddlesome spirit who went to the other young maidens in Israel and said: Do not scorn Mary, the extraordinary is happening to her. The angel went only to Mary, and no one could understand her. Has any woman been as infringed upon, as Mary, and is it not true here also that the one whom God blesses he curses in the same breath? ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 65&lt;ref&gt;See Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 259-260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Knight of Faith is a man or woman of action. (See ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' for the kind of action.) Abraham became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily lifted the knife to sacrifice Isaac. Mary was a Knight of Faith because she volunteered to have Jesus. Jesus became a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily went to the cross. Paul was a Knight of Faith because he voluntarily (resolutely) went to Jerusalem. Kierkegaard considered Diogenes a Knight of Faith also but he didn't have to do great feats or conquer the universe to become one. Kierkegaard stressed the reversal of the inner and the outer in his first book, ''Either/Or''. He may have been thinking that Mary and Joseph, Job, Abraham, Paul, Socrates, and Jesus  all acted in the "innermost being" rather than in the external temporal world at times. However, he made a sharp distinction between Mary and others in his ''[[The Book on Adler]]''. Adler had an action in the innermost being but didn't think it was his job to do what he was told but that it was something he should tell the whole church (assembly) to do. An action in the inner-being is something completely different from an action in the outer being. How does one paint an inner action? How does one show an inner action on the stage? How does one describe it to another?&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 397ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard says, "When the [[Eleatics]] denied [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], as everyone knows, came forward as an opponent. He literally did come forward, because he did not say a word but merely paced back and forth a few times, thereby assuming that he had sufficiently refuted them."&lt;ref&gt;''Repetition'', Hong p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; He used Diogenes in the same way in ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' in 1844. {{Quotation|When Philip threatened to lay siege to the city of Corinth and all its inhabitants hastily bestirred themselves in defense, some polishing weapons, some gathering stones, some repairing the walls, Diogenes seeing all this hurriedly folded his mantle about him and began to roll his tub zealously back and forth through the streets. When he was asked why he did this he replied that he wished to be busy like all the rest, and rolled his tub lest he should be the only idler among so many industrious citizens. Such conduct is at any rate not sophistical, if Aristotle be right in describing sophistry as the art of making money. It is certainly not open to misunderstanding; it is quite inconceivable that Diogenes should have been hailed as the saviour and benefactor of the city. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments '', p. 5 (Kierkegaard was probably quoting Lucian of Samosata from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6829 The Way to Write History)]}}

Kierkegaard kept to the same theme in his earlier and later works. "The great heroic feats are the stuff of history but they are not the stuff of life. Each single individual can do the great things of life. Each of us is born with the power to become what we become. "[Faith] can be grasped and held fast by the simplest of people, it is only the more difficult for the cultured to attain. What a wondrous, inspiring, Christian humanity: the highest is common for all human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 293-294&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues. ... Someone can conquer kingdoms and countries without being a hero; someone else can prove himself a hero by controlling his temper. Someone can display courage by doing the out-of-the-ordinary, another by doing the ordinary. The question is-how does he do it? .... When the originality in earnestness is acquired and preserved, then there is succession and repetition, but as soon as originality is lacking in repetition, there is habit.The earnest person is earnest precisely through the originality from which he returns in repetition. It is said that a living and inward feeling preserves this originality, but the inwardness of the feeling is a fire that may cool as soon as earnestness no longer attends to it. Søren Kierkegaard Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 262, 298, Repetition p. 149&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Then he discovered that life was beautiful, that it was a new gloriousness of faith that no human being can give it to another, that every human being has what is highest, noblest, and most sacred in humankind. It is original in him, and every human being has it if he wants to have it-it is precisely the gloriousness of faith that it can be had only on this condition. Therefore, it is the only unfailing good, because it can be had only by constantly being acquired and can be acquired by continually being generated. ... The original natural power of endurance can be different in different individuals, but as soon as the fulfillment fails to come for such a long time that his original power is consumed and exhausted, then and only then will it become manifest whether a person has new oil in readiness, only then will his patience in expectancy become manifest. ... With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. Only the true expectancy, which requires patience, also teaches patience. But true expectancy is such that it pertains to a person essentially and does not leave it up to his own power to bring about the fulfillment. Therefore every truly expectant person is in a relationship with God.  ... everyone has an original supply of oil with which to sustain expectancy. .... If it is really so that there is something in life that has or can have such power over a person that it little by little makes him forget everything that is noble and sacred and makes him a slave in the service of the world, of the moment; if it is really so that time has or can gain such power over a person that while it adds days to his life it also every passing day measures the greater distance of his life from the divine, until he, trapped in everydayness and habit, becomes alienated from the eternal and the original. Resolution is a wakening up to the eternal. ... The 'individual’ is the category of spirit, of spiritual awakening. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'' (1843-1844) p. 14, 213-214, 220-221, 348 Søren Kierkegaard, ''Point of View'' p. 133 Lowrie&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;when in dealing with the concept of faith the historical is made so one-sidedly significant that the primitive originality of faith in the individual is overlooked, faith becomes a finite pettiness instead of a free infinitude. ... Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward, whereas genuine repetition is recollected forward. ... The transition from [[Potentiality and actuality|possibility to actuality]] is, as Aristotle rightly teaches, a movement. This cannot be said in the language of abstraction at all or understood therein, because abstraction can give movement neither time nor space, which presuppose it or which it presupposes. There is a halt, a [[Leap of faith|leap]]. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 62-63 ''Repetition'' p. 131-132, Concluding Postscript p. 341-342&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Kierkegaard always points the individual forward just as he did with Abraham. He's always expectant of the good instead of dreading the evil. He trusted God. It's the same with the single individual who has to make a resolution to give some finite thing up and has found that the finite has become of infinite importance. &lt;blockquote&gt;Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. In fact, if his faith had been only for the life to come, he certainly would have more readily discarded everything in order to rush out of a world to which he did not belong. ''Fear and Trembling'' p. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard uses this extreme example of the [[paradox]] of faith to help people who are afraid to give something up or to take a risk without any certainty of reward. Abraham was willing to risk everything to follow God and Christ was willing to risk everything to teach humanity how to love. Neither of them knew what would come of it. Abraham learned how to love God but did he learn how to love his neighbor and himself?&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I am anxious about a past misfortune, then this is not because it is in the past but because it may be repeated, i.e., become future. If I am anxious because of a past offense, it is because I have not placed it in an essential relation to myself as past and have in some deceitful way prevented it from being past. If indeed it is actually past, then I cannot be anxious but only repentant. If I do not repent, I have allowed myself to make my relation to the offense dialectical, and by this the offense itself has become a possibility, and not something past. If I am anxious about the punishment, it is only because this has been placed in a dialectical relation to the offense (otherwise I suffer my punishment), and then I am anxious for the possible for the future. Thus we have returned to where we were in Chapter I. Anxiety is the psychological state that precedes sin. It approaches sin as closely as possible, as anxiously as possible, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth only in the [[Leap of faith|qualitative leap]]. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol p. 91-92&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Stanley Friedman]] compared Kierkegaard and Kafka in his 1963 book ''Problematic rebel, an image of modern man'' (p. 386) &lt;blockquote&gt;K. is at times lacking in courage and at other times brazenly impudent, and he is far from "observing every rule of propriety with a glad and confident enthusiasm," like Kierkegaard's "knight of faith." But he does not exalt the Castle "meanly" and, unlike the villagers he dares "to enter those palaces where not merely the memory of the elect abides but . . . the elect themselves." He knows the Angst of Kierkegaard's "knight of faith" who is "born outside the universal" and walks "a solitary path, narrow and steep . . . without meeting a single traveller." Passage after passage in The Castle, indeed, shows K. as essentially a Single One, who has the courage to meet the officials face to face and who is willing to dispense with all the universal patterns and official procedures if he can do so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jacques Maritain]] wrote in 1964, “Soren Kierkegaard was a contemporary of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. But it was only at the beginning of the twentieth century that his name began to become famous and his influence to be felt. Neither a [[philosopher]] in the strict sense of the word-although nourished in philosophy-and yet a philosopher in the sense of being a lay thinker; nor a theologian nor a prophet (obsessed by his feeling for the requirements of the [[Gospel]] and by his own unworthiness, he hardly dared to profess himself a Christian), and yet a kind of prophet and a knight of faith, and, at the end of his life, “a witness to the truth” in his passionate revolt against the established church, this poet of the religious, as he called himself, is a figure complex and ambiguous enough to occupy generations of interpreters and to justify their disagreements.”&lt;ref&gt;Moral Philosophy, Jacques Maritain, Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, 1964, pp. 353-354; see pages 353-370 (Person and Liberty for more)&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that [[Theodor Haecker]] was a knight of faith.&lt;ref&gt;see Haeker’s book Journal in the Night https://archive.org/stream/journalinthenigh009030mbp#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Theological Virtues (Faith) - WGA18670.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Theological Virtues (Faith)|[[Theological Virtues]] by [[Raphael]]]] Kierkegaard used his book ''Fear and Trembling'' to make the claim that Abraham, Mary and a tax collector were also knights of faith. These were just common people so faith isn't just for the "chosen few", he says, "[[Moses]] struck the rock, but  he did not have faith. … Abraham was God’s chosen one, and it was the Lord who imposed the ordeal.”&lt;ref&gt;''Fear and Trembling'', Hong p. 19,&lt;/ref&gt; He says "artists go forward by going backward"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard Journals and papers 1A 86 September 29, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; by writing about Abraham's faith, Job's faith, Paul's faith and even Christ's faith and by creating imaginary constructions about "heroes" of faith they make Christianity difficult for the simple individual who wants to be a Christian. Yet at the same time churches often make Christianity "a matter of course". Faith just grows by itself, it needs no testing by the individual who wants to have faith, it ends up explained by external functions rather than the internal acknowledgement by the single individual who wants to be a Christian. Artistically faith becomes something impossible to reproduce in actual life. Only the person who is existing can reproduce [[Fruit of the Holy Spirit|faith, expectancy, patience, love]]  and the [[Self-control|resolution]] to hold fast to the expectation no matter what happens in his or her own life to the best of their ability. A person can become a Knight of Faith by acting without certainty. This is what Abraham did in ''Fear and Trembling'' and The Young Man failed to do in ''Repetition''. One says, I'll do it because everything within me says I should and the other says I'll do it if everything outside of me says I should. Kierkegaard described the difference well in ''Either/Or''. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one wishes to strip people of their illusions in order to lead them to something more true, here as always you [the esthete] are “at your service in every way.” On the whole you are tireless in tracking down illusions in order to smash them to pieces. You talk so sensibly, with such experience, that anyone who does not know you better must believe that you are a steady man. But you have by no means arrived at what is true. You stopped with destroying the illusion, and since you did it in every conceivable direction, you actually have worked your way into a new illusion-that one can stop with this. Yes, my friend, you are living in an illusion, and you are achieving nothing. Here I have spoken the word that has always had such a strange effect on you. Achieve-“So who is achieving something? That is precisely one of the most dangerous illusions. I do not busy myself in the world at all; I amuse myself the best I can, and I am particularly amused by those people who believe that they are achieving, and is it not indescribably funny that a person believes that? I refuse to burden my life with such grandiose pretensions.” Søren Kierkegaard, ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong, p. 78-79&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biographical==
Kierkegaard was raised by parents who were at opposite poles of the spectrum of faith. His father read philosophy and studied with the leaders of the Church of Denmark while his mother couldn't even read. He had learned the terror of belief at an early age. He stood far to the right of the two extremes of the consciousness of sin: those who believe that they sin because Adam sins, so there is no use trying to stop sinning; and those who believe that every sin is like [[crucifixion|crucifying]] [[Christ]] and possibly commit suicide because they despise themselves so much. One is in danger of being too light-minded about sin, and the other is in danger of being halted or stopped at every moment in fear and trembling. His father taught him the terror of Christianity but his mother showed him the lighter side of the faith. He sought his own balance between the two and he thought his contribution to the discussion about beauty, truth and faith was worth reading. This is how he explained it to himself in ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'', and in his Journals (1849). He died not knowing if he had achieved anything at all but he still had faith.&lt;blockquote&gt;If you had loved people then the earnestness of life might have taught you not to be strident but to become silent, and when you were in distress at sea and did not see land, then at least not to involve others in it; it might have taught you to smile at least as long as you believed anyone sought in your face an explanation, a witness. We do not judge you for doubting, because doubt is a crafty passion, and it can certainly be difficult to tear oneself out of its snares. What we require of the doubter that he be silent. What doubt did not make him happy-why then confide to others what will make them just as unhappy. Doubt is a deep and crafty passion. But he whose soul is not gripped by it so inwardly that he becomes speechless is only shamming this passion, therefore what he says is not only false in itself but above all on his lips. The expectancy of faith, then, is victory. The doubt that comes from the outside does not disturb it, since it disgraces itself by speaking. Yet doubt is guileful, on secret paths it sneaks around a person, and when faith is expecting victory, [[doubt]] whispers that this expectancy is a deception. An expectancy that without a specified time and place is nothing but a deception; In that way one may always go on waiting; such an expectancy is a circle into which the [[soul]] is bewitched and from which it does not escape. In the expectancy of [[faith]], the soul is indeed prevented from falling out of itself, as it were, into multiplicity; it remains in itself, but it would be the worst evil that could befall a person if it escaped from this cycle. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Two Upbuilding Discourses'', May 16, 1843&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I began as an author of ''Either/Or'', I no doubt had a far more profound impression of the terror of Christianity than any clergyman in the country. I had a fear and trembling such as perhaps no one else had. Not that I therefore wanted to relinquish [[Christianity]]. No, I had another interpretation of it. For one thing I had in fact learned very early that there are men who seem to be selected for suffering, and, for another thing, I was conscious of having sinned much and therefore supposed that Christianity had to appear to me in the form of this [[terror]]. But how cruel and false of you, I thought, if you use it to terrify others, perhaps upset every so many happy, loving lives that may very well be truly Christian. It was as alien as it could possibly be to my nature to want to terrify others, and therefore I both sadly and perhaps also a bit proudly found my joy in comforting others and in being gentleness itself to them-hiding the terror in my own interior being. So my idea was to give my [[contemporaries]] (whether or not they themselves would want to understand) a hint in [[humor]]ous form (in order to achieve a lighter tone) that a much greater pressure was needed-but then no more; I aimed to keep my heavy burden to myself, as my cross. I have often taken exception to anyone who was a [[sin]]ner in the strictest sense and then promptly got busy terrifying [[Other (philosophy)|other]]s. Here is where ''Concluding Postscript'' comes in. …

To be '''multifaith''' is to feel an affinity with aspects of more than one [[religion]], [[philosophy]] or [[world-view]], and perhaps to [[belief|believe]] that no one is superior to the others. This term should not be confused with [[interfaith]], which concerns the communication between different religions.

This is inherent to [[Relativism]] but exists among followers of other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], as well as followers of the more liberal currents within [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].

== Relativism ==

Relativism centers on the belief that the best way to honour a divine creator is through the accomplishment of good actions, defined as those motivated by respect and empathy, and that no bad actions can ever be justified in the name of religion. Other religions are considered equally capable of providing a motivation to do good for those who understand them, or to do evil while claiming to do good for those who misinterpret them. 

The term "Relativism" in a religious sense derives from the belief that each individual brings their own wisdom, personality, cultural background and experience to bear on their interpretation of a religion. 

Relativism is open to criticism by the more [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] followers of other religions. In April 2005, in his [[homily]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, the then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] talked about the world "moving towards a dictatorship of Relativism".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970).

The contributions of [[genes]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] to religiosity have been quantified in [[twin study|studies of twins]] (Bouchard ''et al.'', 1999; Kirk ''et al.'', 1999) and sociological studies of welfare, availability, and legal regulations &lt;ref&gt;Nolan, P., &amp; Lenski, G. E. (2010). Human societies: Introduction to macrosociology. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[state religions]], etc.).

Koenig ''et al.'' (2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

'''''Skeptic''''', colloquially known as '''''Skeptic magazine''''', is a quarterly [[science education]] and science advocacy [[magazine]] published internationally by [[The Skeptics Society]], a [[nonprofit]] organization devoted to promoting [[scientific skepticism]] and resisting the spread of [[pseudoscience]], [[superstition]], and [[irrationality|irrational]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/what_we_do/ |title=What We Do |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) |access-date=March 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Michael Shermer]], founder of the Skeptics Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/meet_michael_shermer.html "Meet Michael Shermer"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine was first published in the spring of 1992 and is published through Millennium Press.
Shermer remains the Publisher and [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the magazine and the magazine’s Co-publisher and [[Art Director]] is Pat Linse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/masthead.html |title=Masthead, ''Skeptic'' Magazine. |accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy members of its editorial board include, or have included, [[Oxford University]] [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning scientist [[Jared Diamond]], [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[escape artist]] turned educator [[James Randi|James “The Amazing” Randi]], actor, comedian, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]] '' alumna [[Julia Sweeney]], professional mentalist [[Mark Edward]], science writer [[Daniel Loxton]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] and [[Christof Koch]].
''Skeptic'' has an international circulation with over 50,000 subscriptions and is on newsstands in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref name="skeptic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vueweekly.com/making_a_living_of_bullshit_detecting/ | title=Making a living of bullshit detecting | publisher=[[VUE Weekly]] |date=August 27, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, format and structure ==
The cover story of the magazine's very first issue paid tribute to [[scientist]] and [[science-fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]].
&lt;ref name=Skeptic1&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv01n1&amp;Category_Code=BIA "Vol. 1 No.1 (Premiere Issue) Tribute to Isaac Asimov"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term "[[robotics]]", the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a [[robot]] sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.&lt;ref name="Skeptic2"&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv12n2 "Vol. 12 No. 2 Artificial Intelligence"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as [[creationism]], [[pyramid power]], [[Bigfoot]], [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical claims]] (as in the examples of [[Holocaust denial]] and extreme [[Afrocentrism]]), the use or misuse of theory and [[statistics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[urban myths]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[mass hysterias]], [[genius]] and [[intelligence]], and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving [[protoscience]]s at the leading edge of established science, and even [[fads]] like [[cryonics]] and [[low-carb diet]]s.  In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:

* sponsors lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]]
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as [[SkeptiCamp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticamp.org | title=Skepticamp | accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: [[James Randi]] wrote "’Twas Brillig…," [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote "The Skep Doc" and [[Karen Stollznow]] wrote "Bad Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Table of Contents | magazine=Skeptic | publisher=Skeptics Society | url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol16n02.html | volume=16 | issue=2 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine's page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011).{{CN|date=March 2018}} {{As of |2018}}, the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and [[Carol Tavris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptic: CURRENT ISSUE: VOLUME 23 NUMBER 1|url=https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|website=skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330232530/https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typical topics ===
Each issue features an [[editorial]]. In the past this was provided by [[James Randi]], and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' featuring a [[Brazil]]ian [[faith healer]], [[João de Deus (medium)|João Teixeira]].{{CN|date=March 2018}} Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged [[dowser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-08-31/#feature/|title = A Report from the Paranormal Trenches|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|date = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged [[psychic]]s like [[Sylvia Browne]], and UFOs.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called "Forum". This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from [[professional]]s, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. [[Front cover|Cover stories]] have ranged from examination of alleged [[UFO]]s in [[religious icons]] and theories of the likelihood of [[artificial intelligence]] to tributes to luminaries such as [[Isaac Asimov]]&lt;ref name=Skeptic1/&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulloway, Frank J.]] (February 2005). [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-02-11/ "Ernst Mayr, 1904–2005Remembrances &amp; Tribute"]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as [[intelligent design]] - a frequently recurring topic in the magazine, given the ongoing [[creation vs. evolution controversy]].{{CN|date=March 2018}}

=== ''Junior Skeptic'' ===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:JuniorSkeptic.jpg|thumb|right|''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, and is written and illustrated in a manner more appealing to children]] --&gt;
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers' section called ''[[Junior Skeptic]]''.  Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), ''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

[[Daniel Loxton]] is the Editor of ''Junior Skeptic''. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of ''Junior Skeptic'' appeared in volume 6, #2 of ''Skeptic'' (2000).

== Official podcasts ==
In April 2006, an independent, skeptical talk program called ''Skepticality'' was relaunched as ''[[Skepticality|Skepticality: The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine]]''. New episodes of the show are released on a biweekly basis. The show is produced by the original, continuing show hosts ([[Robynn McCarthy]] and [[Derek Colanduno]]) in collaboration with staff of ''Skeptic'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4470372.ece | title=Podcast of the week: Skepticality offers the 'truth' | publisher=[[The Times]] |date=August 9, 2008 | first=Chris | last=Campling | accessdate=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a second official podcast was added.  ''[[MonsterTalk]]'' critically examines the science behind [[cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] and [[legendary creatures]], such as Bigfoot, the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and
[[werewolves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/ | title=About MonsterTalk | accessdate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monster Talk'' is hosted by Blake Smith, [[Ben Radford]] and Dr. [[Karen Stollznow]].

{{Taoism}}
A '''Taoist temple''' ({{cjkv|t=觀|s=观|p=guān}}, also {{lang|zh|道观}} ''dàoguān'', literally "[place] where the [[Tao]] is observed/cultivated") is a place of worship in [[Taoism]].

Structure and function can vary according to the [[Taoist schools|Taoist school]] the temple belongs to. For example, ''guān'' of the [[Quanzhen School]] are [[monastery|monasteries]] where celibate [[Taoist priest]]s live.

The title ''gōng'' ({{cjkv|t=宫}}) "palace" is often used for large temples built with imperial or governmental patronage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13958">A '''Torah database''' (מאגר תורני or מאגר יהדות) is an electronic collection of classic [[Jewish]] texts in electronic form, the kinds of texts which especially in [[Israel]] are often called [[Judaism#Jewish literature|"The Traditional Jewish Bookshelf"]] (ארון הספרים היהודי); the texts are in their original languages ([[Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]]). These databases contain either keyed-in digital texts or a collection of page-images from printed editions. Given the nature of traditional Jewish [[Torah study]], which involves extensive citation and cross-referencing among hundreds of texts written over the course of thousands of years, many Torah databases also make extensive use of [[hypertext]] links.

A '''Torah database''' usually refers to a collection of primary texts, rather than translations or secondary research and reference materials.

==Digital Text Software Packages==

===The Bar-Ilan Responsa Project===
The very first such database was the [[Bar Ilan Responsa Project]], which began in 1963 at the [[Weizmann Institute]] in Israel, migrated to [[Bar-Ilan University]] soon thereafter, and was up and running by 1967.  It became available in time-sharing mode from university terminals in 1979, was transferred to CD-ROM in 1990, and version 1.0 was offered for sale to the public in 1992.  The current version is number 25 or 25+ (the "plus" version contains an important secondary reference called the [[Encyclopedia Talmudit]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/jh/Responsa/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Responsa Project tries to base its electronic texts on the most accurate printed editions (though it seems that it is sometimes prevented from doing so because of copyright considerations), and it has a reputation for relatively error-free electronic texts based upon those editions.  It also features approximately 360,000 hypertext links between the various collections within the database, as well as a topical halakhic index for the [[Shulchan Aruch]] and selected responsa.  Since its early years it has employed a sophisticated search-engine specifically designed for Hebrew language texts.

In recent years (at least since version 10 in 2002), the Responsa Project has made updates available once a year, between the [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]] holidays.

In January, 2007, the responsa project became available in an online edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsa.co.il/|title=Online Responsa Project - vast Jewish sources|website=www.responsa.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2007 the Responsa Project won the [[Israel Prize]] for Jewish studies.

===DBS Master Library===
DBS rivals the Bar-Ilan Responsa project in size.  It has less in the overall area of [[Halakha]] and fewer [[responsa]], but it includes far more in the following areas: Jewish philosophy, Kabbalah, Hasidut, biblical commentaries, and late halakhic works.

DBS contains a good number of Hebrew texts with vowels ([[niqqud]]); see [[Torah database#Digital Hebrew Texts with Vowels (Niqqud)|below]].  Criticisms: It does not have extensive [[hypertext]] links between its various large collections.

=== Soncino Classics Collection ===

Produced by [[Davka|Davka corporation]], Soncino Classics Collection&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davka.com/cgi-bin/product.cgi?product=35&lt;/ref&gt; includes
# [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] English translations of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah, and Zohar;
# Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Tanach, Babylonian Talmud, Midrash Rabbah and Zohar, as well as Rashi's commentary on Talmud.

Soncino Classics Collection is a commercial software.

===The Torah Bookshelf ("Halamish")===
''Otzar ha-Poskim'' (also see [[Torah database#Otzar ha-Shut|below]]) produces "The Torah Bookshelf," a large digital collection of basic texts called "Halamish" (Ha-Sifriyah ha-Toranit) in Hebrew, currently in version 3.0.

===Ariel===
Ariel (currently version 2.1) uses the same software as Otzar ha-Poskim's "Torah Bookshelf" and is similar to it in scope (a large basic collection), but many of the titles in the two collections are not the same.

===Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer===
[[Bar-Ilan University]]'s project to produce an entirely new critical edition of the Mikra'ot Gedolot is also being made available not only in printed volumes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biu.ac.il/Press/mikraot.html&lt;/ref&gt; but also in electronic form. The project contains four main elements:
*The biblical text (based on the [[Aleppo codex]] and a careful reconstruction of its missing parts) is keyed-in, including vowels and [[cantillation]] signs, allowing for sophisticated research on details of grammar.
*The [[Masoretic Text|masorah]] is also keyed in (also based on the [[Aleppo codex]] and supplemented by a special commentary).
*The [[Targum]] is included with vowels, based on the Yemenite ''Taj''.
*The biblical commentaries are also keyed-in as fresh new critical editions, including textual variants from manuscripts.

The CD-ROM is currently in version 2.0 (beta).

''(Note: Although also under the auspices of Bar-Ilan University, this project is unrelated to the Bar-Ilan Responsa Project.)''

===Digital Hebrew Texts with Vowels (Niqqud)===

====Tanakh====
[[Tanakh]] is available as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels ([[niqqud]]) in ''all'' of the above software packages.

The Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer package includes not only the vowels, but also [[cantillation]] signs.  Tanakh with both vowels and cantillation is also available as online freeware from Mechon Mamre (see [[Torah database#Mechon Mamre|below]]).  Both versions are based on the [[Aleppo codex]], but Mechon Mamre's edition is based on the editing method of Rabbi Mordecai Breuer, which differs slightly from the Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer edition in some small details.

====Targum====
Both [[Targum Onkelos]] on the [[Torah]] and [[Targum Jonathan]] on [[Nevi'im]] are vowelized (based on Yemenite manuscripts) in the digital texts of Mikra'ot Gedolot Haketer.  [[Targum Onkelos]] is vowelized in the Judaic Bookshelf package.

====Mishnah====
The Mishnah is included as a keyed-in digital Hebrew text with vowels in all of the general software packages above. The vowels in the "Halamish" package seem to be based upon the Albeck edition of the Mishnah (see [[Mishnah#Oral traditions and pronunciation|Mishnah]]).

====Siddur and liturgy====
[[Siddur]]: Digital ''siddurim'' with vowels (according to various customs) are included in DBS (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah), Judaic Bookshelf (Ashkenaz, Sefard), and Ariel (Ashkenaz, Sefard, Sefaradi/Edot Mizrah).  The latest version of DBS (version 10) also includes ''mahzorim'', ''selihot'', and the Passover [[Haggadah]].

====Popular ethical works (musar)====
Popular ethical works are normally vowelized in published editions. DBS's collection of such works includes vowels in the electronic editions.

====Popular halakhic works====
Some of these are also vowelized in DBS.

==Page-Image Software Packages==

===Otzar HaHochma===
This project is based on page-images of over 80,000 scanned Jewish books . The search engine allows to search in over 65,000 of these volumes. It is possible to add additional libraries (Mosad Harav Kook, Machon Yerushalayim Publications, Ahavat Shalom Publishers, and Kehot Publication Society). Additionally, the user can find books by topic. The system has features which turns it to a learning tool.[https://www.otzar.org/]

===Otzar ha-Shut===
''Otzar ha-Poskim'' produces "Otzar ha-Shut" (hyperlinked images of individual responsa indexed according to the order of the [[Shulhan Arukh]]).  This package also includes "Halamish" (see [[Torah database#The Torah Bookshelf ("Halamish")|above]]).

===The Steinzaltz Talmud on CD-ROM===
The [[Adin Steinsaltz|Steinsaltz]] Talmud is available as searchable PDF images on CD-ROM.  All material from the printed edition is included, but it can be copied and pasted only as images and not as digital text.

==Wikimedia Torah study projects==
Text study projects at '''[[:s:Wikisource|Wikisource]]''' allow contributors to help build [[free content]] Torah databases at Wikimedia through volunteer typing and editing. Please note that in most instances, these projects proceed much faster in Hebrew than in English.
*'''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]''' (Rabbinic Bible) in '''[[:s:he:מקראות גדולות|Hebrew]]''' [[:s:he:מ"ג איכה א א|(sample)]] and '''[[:s:Mikraot Gedolot|English]]''' [[:s:MG Numbers 1:1|(sample)]].
*'''[[Cantillation]]''' at the '''"Vayavinu Bamikra" Project''' in '''[[:s:he:ויבינו במקרא|Hebrew]]''' (lists nearly 200 recordings) and '''[[:s:Vayavinu Bamikra|English]]'''.
*'''[[Mishnah]]''' in '''[[:s:he:משנה|Hebrew]]''' and '''[[:s:Mishnah|English]]''' [[:s:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Berakhot/Chapter 1/1|(sample)]].
*'''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''' in '''[[:s:he:שולחן ערוך|Hebrew]]''' and '''[[:s:Shulchan Aruch|English]]''' (Hebrew text with English translation).
*'''[[Aruch HaShulchan]]''' is available in a [[:s:he:AHS|newly formatted, digital Hebrew version at Hebrew Wikisource]] (over 600 chapters are currently available). See also [[:s:he:AHS:OH|Orach Chaim index]].

==Free Torah Libraries Online==
All of the databases listed in the main article are patented commercial products, and may not be used without permission of the copyright holders. There are also some online projects that make either digital texts, or public domain images of old books, available to the public for free:

===Hebrew Wikisource===
Hebrew Wikisource&lt;ref&gt;https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/עמוד_ראשי&lt;/ref&gt; contains thousands of [[free content]] Torah texts in a digital library that is continually being expanded and improved by volunteers.

The [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99      ארון הספרים היהודי  (Aron Ha-Sefarim Ha-Yehudi)] project at Wikisource has hundreds of texts available online.

===[http://www.hebrewbooks.org HebrewBooks.org] (public domain images)===
This website was founded in order to preserve old American Hebrew books that are out of print or circulation, but it expanded its mission "to include all Torah Seforim (=books) ever printed".  About 50,000 out-of-print books and journals may be downloaded as PDF images. While many titles are in the [[public domain]] in the [[United States]], they may not be in the [[public domain]] in other countries. Additionally, there are also many copyrighted works that have been submitted by the original authors or their families for inclusion within this website.

The website supports textual search, using [[optical character recognition]] to convert the images into text.

=== [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/ Mechon Mamre] (digital freeware)===
Mechon Mamre makes the following digital Hebrew texts available as [[freeware]] (but claims a copyright on them):
*[[Tanakh]] (including versions with vowels and [[cantillation]] signs)
*Four major sources of the Oral Law:
**[[Mishnah]] (without vowels, based on Maimonides' version)
**[[Tosefta]]
**[[Jerusalem Talmud]]
**[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]
*[[Mishneh Torah]] of Maimonides (based on Yemenite manuscripts)
The digital texts available at Snunit [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/] are taken (with permission) from Mechon Mamre.

===[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/sifrut/yesod.htm The Daat Library] (digital freeware)===
A wide variety of primary texts, including many of R' Yosef Qafih's ("Kapach") and other more critical editions.

===[https://www.sefaria.org The Sefaria Project]===

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.
The [[anthropologist]] and writer on religion and [[post-colonial studies]] [[Talal Asad]] has said ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' is a modern classic and a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talal Asad]] (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697 ''Reading a Modern Classic: W.
